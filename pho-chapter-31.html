                <h3>Chapter 31</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">I die. Again and again and again.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Damn it,” I say, throwing Việt’s console to the ground. I’ve played <i
                        class="calibre5">Apex</i> before, but not as badly, but I guess that’s what happens when my mind
                    isn’t on the game. Instead, it’s on a certain painter, and that date I was so confident to suggest.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">We’re at Việt’s house on our day o from work. Việt is ensconced in his beanbag
                    chair, looking like he was browsing the Internet rather than systematically destroying me and my
                    team. “You suck more than usual,” he says oh-so-observantly.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Thanks. Sorry, let’s try it again.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Okay, whatever you say.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I haven’t had a chance to see Linh, only text her. She said the wedding had gone
                    okay, and that she needed to tell me something, though it might be important since she didn’t text
                    me what the thing was, just that she’d see me soon. A small part of me wonders if she’s regretting
                    everything that happened&mdash; if I’m putting more hope into a relationship that can’t work out.
                    But that kiss Linh had given me, the texts since then&mdash;and the promise that we would see each
                    other&mdash;made it sound like she was in this, all the way. What did she need to talk to me about?
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">When I think of romance and dating, my mind plays out the South Korean dramas that
                    get Mẹ giddy: You know, the kind with the impossibly good-looking guy and the impossibly
                    good-looking girl who’s disguised as an awkward person. Cue scenes with intermittent slow-motion
                    physical contact, gauzy romantic music. Then they somehow end up trapped in an elevator and fall
                    asleep slumped together. These things don’t happen in real life.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre12">I never thought that I’d be staying up late reading <i
                        class="calibre5">Seventeen</i> and <i class="calibre5">Marie Claire</i> articles on first date
                    ideas. I never thought I’d be reading those magazines, period. So far, the options are boring and
                    generic, but I keep trying because my other option is to ask the person who knows Linh best for
                    ideas and that’s Ali, and I don’t want to go there.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">One thing that’s consistent in the articles is that dates should be activities that
                    two people would want to do together. We’ve done the restaurant thing. Movies could work, but we’ve
                    already had six years of silence, once I think about it, so that’s o the list. I thought of Phước
                    Lộc Thọ, but a local mall crawling with people who know either set of parents would make us paranoid
                    the whole time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I am so desperate for an idea that I consult Việt in between games.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">All I get is a blank stare.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But you watch <i class="calibre5">The Bachelor</i>!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I do. But his dates actually suck!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Not helpful.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">The next day, I resolve to find another source: Chef Lê’s place, which is just
                    starting to switch from late afternoon to dinner service. It works out well, since it’s the same day
                    Linh has resolved to submit her paintings to the Gold Keys; she just needs to choose between her final
                    pieces.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh disappears into the back to grab a fresh paint mixer, and that’s when I bring
                    up the whole date issue.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“First date?” Chef Lê shouts across the room at Saffron. “Babe, they’re going on
                    their first date!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I heard you; you don’t need to shout,” she sings back to him, joining us at the
                    center with a sparkling water with lemon in hand.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So what, Bảo, you need some tips?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, kind of.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre12">Saffron says, “Any date you think of will be fine. As long as
                    you don’t do what Bry did.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">His head swivels in her direction. “What do you mean by that? Mine was the pinnacle
                    of romantic dates.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You took me to the Eiffel Tower.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ohhhh. But Chef Lê is less than quick to get it, apparently. “Yeah, it’s
                    beautiful.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Honey, I’m French. Seeing the Tower is like Americans visiting Washington, DC.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">Chef Lê leans forward now, elbows on the table. “So what made you want to go out
                    with me again?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Amused, Saffron takes a sip of her sparkling water. “I guess it was the day we went
                    shopping. Which we didn’t really call a date, but it was one.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“To buy the floor lamp for your apartment? Going <i class="calibre5">shopping</i> was
                    what convinced you?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I thought it was sweet that you decided to go somewhere that you had zero interest
                    in just because I said I wanted to go. I’m not about big gestures. So when you volunteered to come
                    with me, I loved you even more.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So if I took you to the bridge with all those locks, we wouldn’t have ended up
                    together?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I would have left you right away.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Regular comedian today, aren’t you,” Chef Lê grumbles before disappearing into the
                    kitchen.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Saffron winks at me and with laughter still in her voice, says, “It was actually
                    three dates before I decided I liked him. But don’t let him know.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I grin, thinking back to what Saffron just said. It wasn’t the date’s destination
                    that really mattered to her; it was the gesture. She seemed to appreciate something less
                    extravagant, as long as it felt real.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">At that exact moment, Linh comes back, mixer in hand. “Don’t let him know what?”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Nothing,” Sa ron and I pipe back.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000029.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                <p id="calibre_link-205" class="calibre1">An hour later, an idea catches on. I’m sitting down, my back
                    pressed against the heaters emitting air that’s neither hot nor cold. Seeing that I had nothing to
                    do, Chef Lê asked if I could look over his brief speech. As comfortable as I’ve grown with writing,
                    it’s still a shock that someone would trust me with their writing like this.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Hell, I still can’t believe <i class="calibre5">Ali</i> put some semblance of trust
                    in me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">After journalism class today, Ali updated me about Ernie, who handed over his first
                    television review about a <i class="calibre5">Black Mirror</i> episode. It was like another person
                    had penned it. The writing was strong, energetic, and went deeper into the narrative than I’d ever
                    be capable of doing.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now, Linh is just a few feet away, wearing her usual paint gear, nestled
                    comfortably on the top of a ladder as she outlines parts of the mural with chalk.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She has a sketch clipped to her mini canvas and every minute or so, she squints at
                    it, then stares hard at the mural. As if she’s imprinting the image with her mind. Not for the rst
                    time, I’m not in her orbit anymore.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">If I walk out, will she even notice?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I set down my laptop and stand, fighting back a smile.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’ll go blind if you squint that much.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You sound like my mom.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m channeling mine.” I grin once I’m by the mural.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Shut up</i>,” Linh answers, refusing to look at me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I wish I could lean up, steal a kiss. It’s been a few minutes since our last.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Bảo,” she says, still focused on her design. “I can feel you. You’re hovering.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Just… making sure the ladder’s secure.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh rolls her eyes at me, then shakes her head so that her ponytail slides off her
                    shoulder, back to a free hang.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What photo do you have?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s called reference photo. Chef Lê gave it to me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I know I should let her concentrate. And that she needs to get this mural done. But
                    I also can’t wait to ask my question.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I clear my throat. “So are you&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I haven’t gured out a way&mdash;”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre12">We stare at each other, laughing nervously as we talk over
                    each other’s sentences.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, you go. You haven’t figured out a way to… what?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“At the wedding, I ran into Bác Xuân, who gave us the restaurant. And he actually
                    knew my mom before they ever lived here. He knew her back in Vietnam.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I blink at her sudden statement.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh blows out air. “<i class="calibre5">And</i> that’s not the only person he
                    knows.” She gazes down at me. “He also knows your mom from Vietnam.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Whoa,” I say. I sit down by the foot of the ladder. Linh eventually comes down,
                    gesturing for me to scoot over as she sits right next to me. I think the air circulation has somehow
                    gotten cut off , because suddenly I’m dizzy and barely feel the surface beneath me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh goes on, maybe too lost in her own thoughts to notice my reaction. “So I’m
                    starting to think that this feud goes way back&mdash;before we were alive. It happened back <i
                        class="calibre5">there</i>, and it must have been bad if our moms aren’t talking to this day.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That’s&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Exactly.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“And you don’t know what caused it?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh nods and shrugs at the same time. “Bác Xuân wouldn’t say another word. He said
                    it’s not his story to tell.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh tells me what Bác said about their neighborhood being close, how they all
                    helped each other in need. Almost as if they’d become a family. So whatever happened between them
                    had to be capable of breaking apart a family. Based on gossip from my mom’s circle, that could be
                    anything. They’d mentioned a family whose youngest son had gotten into drugs, which got him banned
                    from ever entering his childhood home. A man who was sixty years old went back to Vietnam to find a
                    wife half his age, leaving his ex-wife and two kids to basically fend for themselves. The wrongs
                    done to the family seemed limitless.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Okay, we’re getting somewhere,” I say numbly. We are, but what if we eventually nd
                    something that’s bigger than we ever imagined? What if it turns out it’s nothing we can ever fix? What
                    would that do to our families? To me and Linh?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre12">Linh slips her hand into mine. “I’m still here, you know.
                    Nothing’s changing the way I feel about you. Whatever we find out, we’ll find out together.”</p>
