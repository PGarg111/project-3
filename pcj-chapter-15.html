                <h2>CHAPTER 15: A GOD BUYS US CHEESEBURGERS</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                                    class="calibre12">T</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">HE NEXT
                        AFTERNOON,</span> J<span class="calibre5">UNE 14,</span> seven days before the solstice, our
                    train rolled into Denver. We hadn’t eaten since the night before in the dining car, somewhere in
                    Kansas. We hadn’t taken a shower since Half-Blood Hill, and I was sure that was obvious.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Let’s try to contact Chiron,” Annabeth said. “I want to tell him about your talk
                    with the river spirit.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We can’t use phones, right?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m not talking about phones.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We wandered through downtown for about half an hour, though I wasn’t sure what
                    Annabeth was looking for. The air was dry and hot, which felt weird after the humidity of St. Louis.
                    Everywhere we turned, the Rocky Mountains seemed to be staring at me, like a tidal wave about to
                    crash into the city.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Finally we found an empty do-it-yourself car wash. We veered toward the stall
                    farthest from the street, keeping our eyes open for patrol cars. We were three adolescents hanging
                    out at a car wash without a car; any cop worth his doughnuts would figure we were up to no good.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What exactly are we doing?” I asked, as Grover took out the spray gun.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre17">“It’s seventy-five cents,” he grumbled. “I’ve only got two
                    quarters left. Annabeth?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Don’t look at me,” she said. “The dining car wiped me out.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I fished out my last bit of change and passed Grover a quarter, which left me two
                    nickels and one drachma from Medusa’s place.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Excellent,” Grover said. “We could do it with a spray bottle, of course, but the
                    connection isn’t as good, and my arm gets tired of pumping.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What are you talking about?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He fed in the quarters and set the knob to <span class="calibre5">FINE MIST</span>.
                    “I-M’ing.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Instant messaging?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre7">Iris</i>-messaging,” Annabeth corrected. “The rainbow goddess
                    Iris carries messages for the gods. If you know how to ask, and she’s not too busy, she’ll do the
                    same for half-bloods.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You summon the goddess with a spray gun?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover pointed the nozzle in the air and water hissed out in a thick white mist.
                    “Unless you know an easier way to make a rainbow.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Sure enough, late afternoon light filtered through the vapor and broke into colors.
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-231" class="calibre17">Annabeth held her palm out to me. “Drachma, please.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I handed it over.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She raised the coin over her head. “O goddess, accept our offering.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She threw the drachma into the rainbow. It disappeared in a golden shimmer.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Half-Blood Hill,” Annabeth requested.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">For a moment, nothing happened.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Then I was looking through the mist at strawberry fields, and the Long Island Sound
                    in the distance. We seemed to be on the porch of the Big House. Standing with his back to us at the
                    railing was a sandy-haired guy in shorts and an orange tank top. He was holding a bronze sword and
                    seemed to be staring intently at something down in the meadow.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Luke!” I called.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He turned, eyes wide. I could swear he was standing three feet in front of me
                    through a screen of mist, except I could only see the part of him that appeared in the rainbow.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Percy!” His scarred face broke into a grin. “Is that Annabeth, too? Thank the
                    gods! Are you guys okay?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We’re…uh…fine,” Annabeth stammered. She was madly straightening her dirty T-shirt,
                    trying to comb the loose hair out of her face. “We thought &mdash;Chiron&mdash;I mean&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“He’s down at the cabins.” Luke’s smile faded. “We’re having some issues with the
                    campers. Listen, is everything cool with you? Is Grover all right?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m right here,” Grover called. He held the nozzle out to one side and stepped
                    into Luke’s line of vision. “What kind of issues?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Just then a big Lincoln Continental pulled into the car wash with its stereo turned
                    to maximum hip-hop. As the car slid into the next stall, the bass from the subwoofers vibrated so
                    much, it shook the pavement.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Chiron had to&mdash;what’s that noise?” Luke yelled.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’ll take care of it!” Annabeth yelled back, looking very relieved to have an
                    excuse to get out of sight. “Grover, come on!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What?” Grover said. “But&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Give Percy the nozzle and come on!” she ordered.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover muttered something about girls being harder to understand than the Oracle at
                    Delphi, then he handed me the spray gun and followed Annabeth.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre17">I readjusted the hose so I could keep the rainbow going and
                    still see Luke.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Chiron had to break up a fight,” Luke shouted to me over the music. “Things are
                    pretty tense here, Percy. Word leaked out about the Zeus&ndash; Poseidon standoff. We’re still not
                    sure how&mdash;probably the same scumbag who summoned the hellhound. Now the campers are starting to
                    take sides. It’s shaping up like the Trojan War all over again. Aphrodite, Ares, and Apollo are
                    backing Poseidon, more or less. Athena is backing Zeus.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I shuddered to think that Clarisse’s cabin would ever be on my dad’s side for
                    anything. In the next stall, I heard Annabeth and some guy arguing with each other, then the music’s
                    volume decreased drastically.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“So what’s your status?” Luke asked me. “Chiron will be sorry he missed you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I told him pretty much everything, including my dreams. It felt so good to see him,
                    to feel like I was back at camp even for a few minutes, that I didn’t realize how long I had talked
                    until the beeper went off on the spray machine, and I realized I only had one more minute before the
                    water shut off.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I wish I could be there,” Luke told me. “We can’t help much from here, I’m afraid,
                    but listen…it had to be Hades who took the master bolt. He was there at Olympus at the winter
                    solstice. I was chaperoning a field trip and we saw him.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“But Chiron said the gods can’t take each other’s magic items directly.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s true,” Luke said, looking troubled. “Still…Hades has the helm of darkness.
                    How could anybody else sneak into the throne room and steal the master bolt? You’d have to be
                    invisible.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We were both silent, until Luke seemed to realize what he’d said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh, hey,” he protested. “I didn’t mean Annabeth. She and I have known each other
                    forever. She would never…I mean, she’s like a little sister to me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I wondered if Annabeth would like that description. In the stall next to us, the
                    music stopped completely. A man screamed in terror, car doors slammed, and the Lincoln peeled out of
                    the car wash.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’d better go see what that was,” Luke said. “Listen, are you wearing the flying
                    shoes? I’ll feel better if I know they’ve done you some good.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh…uh, yeah!” I tried not to sound like a guilty liar. “Yeah, they’ve come in
                    handy.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Really?” He grinned. “They fit and everything?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-233" class="calibre17">The water shut off. The mist started to evaporate.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Well, take care of yourself out there in Denver,” Luke called, his voice getting
                    fainter. “And tell Grover it’ll be better this time! Nobody will get turned into a pine tree if he
                    just&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">But the mist was gone, and Luke’s image faded to nothing. I was alone in a wet,
                    empty car wash stall.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover came around the corner, laughing, but stopped when they saw my
                    face. Annabeth’s smile faded. “What happened, Percy? What did Luke say?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Not much,” I lied, my stomach feeling as empty as a Big Three cabin. “Come on,
                    let’s find some dinner.”</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">A few minutes later, we were sitting at a booth in a gleaming chrome diner. All
                    around us, families were eating burgers and drinking malts and sodas.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Finally the waitress came over. She raised her eyebrow skeptically. “Well?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I said, “We, um, want to order dinner.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You kids have money to pay for it?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover’s lower lip quivered. I was afraid he would start bleating, or worse, start
                    eating the linoleum. Annabeth looked ready to pass out from hunger.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I was trying to think up a sob story for the waitress when a rumble shook the whole
                    building; a motorcycle the size of a baby elephant had pulled up to the curb.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">All conversation in the diner stopped. The motorcycle’s headlight glared red. Its
                    gas tank had flames painted on it, and a shotgun holster riveted to either side, complete with
                    shotguns. The seat was leather&mdash;but leather that looked like…well, Caucasian human skin.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The guy on the bike would’ve made pro wrestlers run for Mama. He was dressed in a
                    red muscle shirt and black jeans and a black leather duster, with a hunting knife strapped to his
                    thigh. He wore red wraparound shades, and he had the cruelest, most brutal face I’d ever
                    seen&mdash;handsome, I guess, but wicked&mdash;with an oily black crew cut and cheeks that were
                    scarred from many, many fights. The weird thing was, I felt like I’d seen his face somewhere before.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">As he walked into the diner, a hot, dry wind blew through the place. All the people
                    rose, as if they were hypnotized, but the biker waved his hand dismissively and they all sat down
                    again. Everybody went back to their conversations. The waitress blinked, as if somebody had just
                    pressed the rewind button on her brain. She asked us again, “You kids have money to pay for it?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-234" class="calibre17">The biker said, “It’s on me.” He slid into our booth, which
                    was way too small for him, and crowded Annabeth against the window.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He looked up at the waitress, who was gaping at him, and said, “Are you still
                    here?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He pointed at her, and she stiffened. She turned as if she’d been spun around, then
                    marched back toward the kitchen.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The biker looked at me. I couldn’t see his eyes behind the red shades, but bad
                    feelings started boiling in my stomach. Anger, resentment, bitterness. I wanted to hit a wall. I
                    wanted to pick a fight with somebody. Who did this guy think he was?</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He gave me a wicked grin. “So you’re old Seaweed’s kid, huh?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I should’ve been surprised, or scared, but instead I felt like I was looking at my
                    stepdad, Gabe. I wanted to rip this guy’s head off. “What’s it to you?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth’s eyes flashed me a warning. “Percy, this is&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The biker raised his hand.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“S’okay,” he said. “I don’t mind a little attitude. Long as you remember who’s the
                    boss. You know who I am, little cousin?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Then it struck me why this guy looked familiar. He had the same vicious sneer as
                    some of the kids at Camp Half-Blood, the ones from cabin five.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’re Clarisse’s dad,” I said. “Ares, god of war.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Ares grinned and took off his shades. Where his eyes should’ve been, there was only
                    fire, empty sockets glowing with miniature nuclear explosions. “That’s right, punk. I heard you
                    broke Clarisse’s spear.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“She was asking for it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Probably. That’s cool. I don’t fight my kids’ fights, you know? What I’m here
                    for&mdash;I heard you were in town. I got a little proposition for you.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre17">The waitress came back with heaping trays of
                    food&mdash;cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings, and chocolate shakes.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Ares handed her a few gold drachmas.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She looked nervously at the coins. “But, these aren’t…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Ares pulled out his huge knife and started cleaning his fingernails. “Problem,
                    sweetheart?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The waitress swallowed, then left with the gold.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You can’t do that,” I told Ares. “You can’t just threaten people with a knife.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">Ares laughed. “Are you kidding? I love this country. Best place since Sparta. Don’t
                    you carry a weapon, punk? You should. Dangerous world out there. Which brings me to my proposition.
                    I need you to do me a favor.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What favor could I do for a god?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Something a god doesn’t have time to do himself. It’s nothing much. I left my
                    shield at an abandoned water park here in town. I was going on a little…date with my girlfriend. We
                    were interrupted. I left my shield behind. I want you to fetch it for me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Why don’t you go back and get it yourself?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The fire in his eye sockets glowed a little hotter.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Why don’t I turn you into a prairie dog and run you over with my Harley? Because I
                    don’t feel like it. A god is giving you an opportunity to prove yourself, Percy Jackson. Will you
                    prove yourself a coward?” He leaned forward. “Or maybe you only fight when there’s a river to dive
                    into, so your daddy can protect you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I wanted to punch this guy, but somehow, I knew he was waiting for that. Ares’s
                    power was causing my anger. He’d love it if I attacked. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We’re not interested,” I said. “We’ve already got a quest.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Ares’s fiery eyes made me see things I didn’t want to see&mdash;blood and smoke and
                    corpses on the battlefield. “I know all about your quest, punk. When that <i
                        class="calibre7">item</i> was first stolen, Zeus sent his best out looking for it: Apollo,
                    Athena, Artemis, and me, naturally. If I couldn’t sniff out a weapon that powerful…” He licked his
                    lips, as if the very thought of the master bolt made him hungry. “Well…if I couldn’t find it, you
                    got no hope. Nevertheless, I’m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. Your dad and I go way
                    back. After all, I’m the one who told him my suspicions about old Corpse Breath.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-237" class="calibre17">“You told him Hades stole the bolt?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Sure. Framing somebody to start a war. Oldest trick in the book. I recognized it
                    immediately. In a way, you got me to thank for your little quest.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Thanks,” I grumbled.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Hey, I’m a generous guy. Just do my little job, and I’ll help you on your way.
                    I’ll arrange a ride west for you and your friends.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We’re doing fine on our own.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yeah, right. No money. No wheels. No clue what you’re up against. Help me out, and
                    maybe I’ll tell you something you need to know. Something about your mom.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“My mom?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He grinned. “That got your attention. The water park is a mile west on Delancy. You
                    can’t miss it. Look for the Tunnel of Love ride.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What interrupted your date?” I asked. “Something scare you off?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Ares bared his teeth, but I’d seen his threatening look before on Clarisse. There
                    was something false about it, almost like he was nervous.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’re lucky you met me, punk, and not one of the other Olympians. They’re not as
                    forgiving of rudeness as I am. I’ll meet you back here when you’re done. Don’t disappoint me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">After that I must have fainted, or fallen into a trance, because when I opened my
                    eyes again, Ares was gone. I might’ve thought the conversation had been a dream, but Annabeth’s and
                    Grover’s expressions told me otherwise.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Not good,” Grover said. “Ares sought you out, Percy. This is not good.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I stared out the window. The motorcycle had disappeared.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Did Ares really know something about my mom, or was he just playing with me? Now
                    that he was gone, all the anger had drained out of me. I realized Ares must love to mess with
                    people’s emotions. That was his power &mdash;cranking up the passions so badly, they clouded your
                    ability to think.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“It’s probably some kind of trick,” I said. “Forget Ares. Let’s just go.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We can’t,” Annabeth said. “Look, I hate Ares as much as anybody, but you don’t
                    ignore the gods unless you want serious bad fortune. He wasn’t kidding about turning you into a
                    rodent.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked down at my cheeseburger, which suddenly didn’t seem so appetizing. “Why
                    does he need us?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre17">“Maybe it’s a problem that requires brains,” Annabeth said.
                    “Ares has strength. That’s all he has. Even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“But this water park…he acted almost scared. What would make a war god run away
                    like that?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover glanced nervously at each other.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, “I’m afraid we’ll have to find out.”</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">The sun was sinking behind the mountains by the time we found the water park.
                    Judging from the sign, it once had been called <span class="calibre5">WATERLAND</span>, but now some
                    of the letters were smashed out, so it read <span class="calibre5">WAT R A D</span>.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The main gate was padlocked and topped with barbed wire. Inside, huge dry
                    waterslides and tubes and pipes curled everywhere, leading to empty pools. Old tickets and
                    advertisements fluttered around the asphalt. With night coming on, the place looked sad and creepy.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">“If Ares brings his girlfriend here for a date,” I said, staring up at the barbed
                    wire, “I’d hate to see what she looks like.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Percy,” Annabeth warned. “Be more respectful.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Why?” I thought you hated Ares.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“He’s still a god. And his girlfriend is very temperamental.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You don’t want to insult her looks,” Grover added.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Who is she? Echidna?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No, Aphrodite,” Grover said, a little dreamily. “Goddess of love.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I thought she was married to somebody,” I said. “Hephaestus.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What’s your point?” he asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh.” I suddenly felt the need to change the subject. “So how do we get in?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">“Maia!</i>” Grover’s shoes sprouted wings.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He flew over the fence, did an unintended somersault in midair, then stumbled to a
                    landing on the opposite side. He dusted off his jeans, as if he’d planned the whole thing. “You guys
                    coming?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and I had to climb the old-fashioned way, holding down the barbed wire for
                    each other as we crawled over the top.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The shadows grew long as we walked through the park, checking out the attractions.
                    There was Ankle Biter Island, Head Over Wedgie, and Dude, Where’s My Swimsuit?</p>
                <p class="calibre17">No monsters came to get us. Nothing made the slightest noise.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-239" class="calibre17">We found a souvenir shop that had been left open. Merchandise
                    still lined the shelves: snow globes, pencils, postcards, and racks of&mdash;</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Clothes,” Annabeth said. “Fresh clothes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yeah,” I said. “But you can’t just&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Watch me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She snatched an entire row of stuff off the racks and disappeared into the changing
                    room. A few minutes later she came out in Waterland flower-print shorts, a big red Waterland
                    T-shirt, and commemorative Waterland surf shoes. A Waterland backpack was slung over her shoulder,
                    obviously stuffed with more goodies.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What the heck.” Grover shrugged. Soon, all three of us were decked out like
                    walking advertisements for the defunct theme park.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We continued searching for the Tunnel of Love. I got the feeling that the whole
                    park was holding its breath. “So Ares and Aphrodite,” I said, to keep my mind off the growing dark,
                    “they have a thing going?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s old gossip, Percy,” Annabeth told me. “Three-thousand-year-old gossip.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What about Aphrodite’s husband?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Well, you know,” she said. “Hephaestus. The blacksmith. He was crippled when he
                    was a baby, thrown off Mount Olympus by Zeus. So he isn’t exactly handsome. Clever with his hands,
                    and all, but Aphrodite isn’t into brains and talent, you know?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“She likes bikers.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Whatever.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Hephaestus knows?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh sure,” Annabeth said. “He caught them together once. I mean, literally caught
                    them, in a golden net, and invited all the gods to come and laugh at them. Hephaestus is always
                    trying to embarrass them. That’s why they meet in out-of-the-way places, like…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She stopped, looking straight ahead. “Like that.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">In front of us was an empty pool that would’ve been awesome for skateboarding. It
                    was at least fifty yards across and shaped like a bowl.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Around the rim, a dozen bronze statues of Cupid stood guard with wings spread and
                    bows ready to fire. On the opposite side from us, a tunnel opened up, probably where the water
                    flowed into when the pool was full. The sign above it read, <span class="calibre5">THRILL RIDE O’
                        LOVE: THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENTS’ TUNNEL OF</span> <span class="calibre5">LOVE</span> !</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-240" class="calibre17">Grover crept toward the edge. “Guys, look.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Marooned at the bottom of the pool was a pink-and-white two-seater boat with a
                    canopy over the top and little hearts painted all over it. In the left seat, glinting in the fading
                    light, was Ares’s shield, a polished circle of bronze.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“This is too easy,” I said. “So we just walk down there and get it?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth ran her fingers along the base of the nearest cupid statue.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“There’s a Greek letter carved here,” she said. “Eta. I wonder…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Grover,” I said, “you smell any monsters?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He sniffed the wind. “Nothing.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Nothing&mdash;like, in-the-Arch-and-you-didn’t-smell-Echidna nothing, or really
                    nothing?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover looked hurt. “I told you, that was underground.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Okay. I’m sorry.” I took a deep breath. “I’m going down there.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’ll go with you.” Grover didn’t sound too enthusiastic, but I got the feeling he
                    was trying to make up for what had happened in St. Louis.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No,” I told him. “I want you to stay up top with the flying shoes. You’re the Red
                    Baron, a flying ace, remember? I’ll be counting on you for backup, in case something goes wrong.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover puffed up his chest a little. “Sure. But what could go wrong?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I don’t know. Just a feeling. Annabeth, come with me&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Are you kidding?” She looked at me as if I’d just dropped from the moon. Her
                    cheeks were bright red.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What’s the problem now?” I demanded.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Me, go with you to the…the ‘Thrill Ride of Love’? How embarrassing is that? What
                    if somebody saw me?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Who’s going to see you?” But my face was burning now, too. Leave it to a girl to
                    make everything complicated. “Fine,” I told her. “I’ll do it myself.” But when I started down the
                    side of the pool, she followed me, muttering about how boys always messed things up.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We reached the boat. The shield was propped on one seat, and next to it was a
                    lady’s silk scarf. I tried to imagine Ares and Aphrodite here, a couple of gods meeting in a
                    junked-out amusement-park ride. Why? Then I noticed something I hadn’t seen from up top: mirrors all
                    the way around the rim of the pool, facing this spot. We could see ourselves no matter which
                    direction we looked. That must be it. While Ares and Aphrodite were smooching with each other they
                    could look at their favorite people: themselves.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-241" class="calibre17">I picked up the scarf. It shimmered pink, and the perfume was
                    indescribable&mdash;rose, or mountain laurel. Something good. I smiled, a little dreamy, and was
                    about to rub the scarf against my cheek when Annabeth ripped it out of my hand and stuffed it in her
                    pocket. “Oh, no you don’t. Stay away from that love magic.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Just get the shield, Seaweed Brain, and let’s get out of here.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The moment I touched the shield, I knew we were in trouble. My hand broke through
                    something that had been connecting it to the dashboard. A cobweb, I thought, but then I looked at a
                    strand of it on my palm and saw it was some kind of metal filament, so fine it was almost invisible.
                    A trip wire.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Wait,” Annabeth said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Too late.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“There’s another Greek letter on the side of the boat, another Eta. This is a
                    trap.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Noise erupted all around us, of a million gears grinding, as if the whole pool were
                    turning into one giant machine.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover yelled, “Guys!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Up on the rim, the Cupid statues were drawing their bows into firing position.
                    Before I could suggest taking cover, they shot, but not at us. They fired at each other, across the
                    rim of the pool. Silky cables trailed from the arrows, arcing over the pool and anchoring where they
                    landed to form a huge golden asterisk. Then smaller metallic threads started weaving together
                    magically between the main strands, making a net.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-244" class="calibre17">“We have to get out,” I said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Duh!” Annabeth said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I grabbed the shield and we ran, but going up the slope of the pool was not as easy
                    as going down.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Come on!” Grover shouted.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He was trying to hold open a section of the net for us, but wherever he touched it,
                    the golden threads started to wrap around his hands.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The Cupids’ heads popped open. Out came video cameras. Spotlights rose up all
                    around the pool, blinding us with illumination, and a loudspeaker voice boomed: “Live to Olympus in
                    one minute…Fifty-nine seconds, fifty-eight…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Hephaestus!” Annabeth screamed. “I’m so stupid! Eta is ‘H.’ He made this trap to
                    catch his wife with Ares. Now we’re going to be broadcast live to Olympus and look like absolute
                    fools!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We’d almost made it to the rim when the row of mirrors opened like hatches and
                    thousands of tiny metallic…things poured out.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth screamed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">It was an army of wind-up creepy-crawlies: bronze-gear bodies, spindly legs, little
                    pincer mouths, all scuttling toward us in a wave of clacking, whirring metal.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Spiders!” Annabeth said. “Sp&mdash;sp&mdash;aaaah!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I’d never seen her like this before. She fell backward in terror and almost got
                    overwhelmed by the spider robots before I pulled her up and dragged her back toward the boat.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The things were coming out from all around the rim now, millions of them, flooding
                    toward the center of the pool, completely surrounding us. I told myself they probably weren’t
                    programmed to kill, just corral us and bite us and make us look stupid. Then again, this was a trap
                    meant for gods. And we weren’t gods.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-245" class="calibre17">Annabeth and I climbed into the boat. I started kicking away
                    the spiders as they swarmed aboard. I yelled at Annabeth to help me, but she was too paralyzed to do
                    much more than scream.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Thirty, twenty-nine,” called the loudspeaker.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The spiders started spitting out strands of metal thread, trying to tie us down.
                    The strands were easy enough to break at first, but there were so many of them, and the spiders just
                    kept coming. I kicked one away from Annabeth’s leg and its pincers took a chunk out of my new surf
                    shoe.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover hovered above the pool in his flying sneakers, trying to pull the net loose,
                    but it wouldn’t budge.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Think, I told myself. Think.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The Tunnel of Love entrance was under the net. We could use it as an exit, except
                    that it was blocked by a million robot spiders.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Fifteen, fourteen,” the loudspeaker called.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Water, I thought. Where does the ride’s water come from?</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Then I saw them: huge water pipes behind the mirrors, where the spiders had come
                    from. And up above the net, next to one of the Cupids, a glass-windowed booth that must be the
                    controller’s station.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Grover!” I yelled. “Get into that booth! Find the ‘on’ switch!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“But&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Do it!” It was a crazy hope, but it was our only chance. The spiders were all over
                    the prow of the boat now. Annabeth was screaming her head off. I had to get us out of there.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover was in the controller’s booth now, slamming away at the buttons.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Five, four&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover looked up at me hopelessly, raising his hands. He was letting me know that
                    he’d pushed every button, but still nothing was happening.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I closed my eyes and thought about waves, rushing water, the Mississippi River. I
                    felt a familiar tug in my gut. I tried to imagine that I was dragging the ocean all the way to
                    Denver.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Two, one, <i class="calibre7">zero</i>!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Water exploded out of the pipes. It roared into the pool, sweeping away the
                    spiders. I pulled Annabeth into the seat next to me and fastened her seat belt just as the tidal
                    wave slammed into our boat, over the top, whisking the spiders away and dousing us completely, but
                    not capsizing us. The boat turned, lifted in the flood, and spun in circles around the whirlpool.
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-246" class="calibre17">The water was full of short-circuiting spiders, some of them
                    smashing against the pool’s concrete wall with such force they burst.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Spotlights glared down at us. The Cupid-cams were rolling, live to Olympus.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">But I could only concentrate on controlling the boat. I willed it to ride the
                    current, to keep away from the wall. Maybe it was my imagination, but the boat seemed to respond. At
                    least, it didn’t break into a million pieces. We spun around one last time, the water level now
                    almost high enough to shred us against the metal net. Then the boat’s nose turned toward the tunnel
                    and we rocketed through into the darkness.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and I held tight, both of us screaming as the boat shot curls and hugged
                    corners and took forty-five-degree plunges past pictures of Romeo and Juliet and a bunch of other
                    Valentine’s Day stuff.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Then we were out of the tunnel, the night air whistling through our hair as the
                    boat barreled straight toward the exit.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">If the ride had been in working order, we would’ve sailed off a ramp between the
                    golden Gates of Love and splashed down safely in the exit pool. But there was a problem. The Gates
                    of Love were chained. Two boats that had been washed out of the tunnel before us were now piled
                    against the barricade&mdash;one submerged, the other cracked in half.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Unfasten your seat belt,” I yelled to Annabeth.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Are you crazy?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Unless you want to get smashed to death.” I strapped Ares’s shield to my arm.
                    “We’re going to have to jump for it.” My idea was simple and insane. As the boat struck, we would
                    use its force like a springboard to jump the gate. I’d heard of people surviving car crashes that
                    way, getting thrown thirty or forty feet away from an accident. With luck, we would land in the
                    pool.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth seemed to understand. She gripped my hand as the gates got closer.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“On my mark,” I said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No! On my mark!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Simple physics!” she yelled. “Force times the trajectory angle&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Fine!” I shouted. “On <i class="calibre7">your</i> mark!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She hesitated…hesitated…then yelled, “Now!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Crack!</i></p>
                <p id="calibre_link-247" class="calibre17">Annabeth was right. If we’d jumped when I thought we
                    should’ve, we would’ve crashed into the gates. She got us maximum lift.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Unfortunately, that was a little more than we needed. Our boat smashed into the
                    pileup and we were thrown into the air, straight over the gates, over the pool, and down toward
                    solid asphalt.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Something grabbed me from behind.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth yelled, “Ouch!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover!</p>
                <p class="calibre17">In midair, he had grabbed me by the shirt, and Annabeth by the arm, and was trying
                    to pull us out of a crash landing, but Annabeth and I had all the momentum.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’re too heavy!” Grover said. “We’re going down!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We spiraled toward the ground, Grover doing his best to slow the fall.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We smashed into a photo-board, Grover’s head going straight into the hole where
                    tourists would put their faces, pretending to be Noo-Noo the Friendly Whale. Annabeth and I tumbled
                    to the ground, banged up but alive. Ares’s shield was still on my arm.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Once we caught our breath, Annabeth and I got Grover out of the photo-board and
                    thanked him for saving our lives. I looked back at the Thrill Ride of Love. The water was subsiding.
                    Our boat had been smashed to pieces against the gates.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-248" class="calibre17">A hundred yards away, at the entrance pool, the Cupids were
                    still filming. The statues had swiveled so that their cameras were trained straight on us, the
                    spotlights in our faces.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Show’s over!” I yelled. “Thank you! Good night!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The Cupids turned back to their original positions. The lights shut off. The park
                    went quiet and dark again, except for the gentle trickle of water into the Thrill Ride of Love’s
                    exit pool. I wondered if Olympus had gone to a commercial break, or if our ratings had been any
                    good.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I hated being teased. I hated being tricked. And I had plenty of experience
                    handling bullies who liked to do that stuff to me. I hefted the shield on my arm and turned to my
                    friends. “We need to have a little talk with Ares.”</p>
