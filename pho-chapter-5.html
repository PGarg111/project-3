                <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre5">Con ăn giống như mèo</i>,” Mẹ says. According to her, I’m
                    eating like a cat right now. I look down at the meal before me: a nearly finished <i
                        class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> in a bowl,</p>
                <p class="calibre4">oating in <i class="calibre5">nước mắm</i>&mdash;my fth serving in twenty minutes.
                    Other times, Mẹ</p>
                <p class="calibre1">accuses me of eating too much like Ba.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Three hours ago, my parents were in the kitchen checking on their Powerball
                    numbers, their concentration resembling scientists working toward a breakthrough cure. After each
                    ticket failed to yield winning numbers, they placed it in a pile that goes into the “everything
                    drawer” in their bedroom. <i class="calibre5">Everything</i>’s there: keys with no locks to t them
                    in; nail clippers; prescribed medicine for their high cholesterol (which they trade sometimes, and
                    I’m pretty sure they’re not supposed to do that); and pictures of me at various ages. Mẹ had glanced
                    through the kitchen screen door. “Oh look, it’s raining.” She nodded to herself. “A good day to have
                    <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ah,” Ba said in agreement, before striking out another losing ticket.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">And here we are.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Why does <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> taste good when it rains? Every time I
                    ask my parents they always start to explain&mdash;“<i class="calibre5">Tại vì</i>…”&mdash;and then
                    something else grabs their attention. I’ve come up with my own explanation. I’m not sure there’s a
                    scientific reason, but I do know that <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> tastes like a good re when the
                    outside pavement is wet, the air ripe with earth and cement. I found a word for that smell:
                    “petrichor.” In this kind of weather, nothing tastes better than rice</p>
                <p class="calibre4">our, made yellow by turmeric powder, cooked crisp, packed with chewy pork</p>
                <p class="calibre1">belly, shrimp, bean sprouts, in one megabite.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-32" class="calibre12">Thinking that we need another batch, Mẹ disappears outside in
                    her raincoat,</p>
                <p class="calibre4">fishing out another piece. She noisily slides the screen door open, returning with</p>
                <p class="calibre1">a giddy smile. A perfectly cooked <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> sizzles on the
                    plate. My body a half hour ago would have been like, <i class="calibre5">Oh</i> yes. She gestures
                    for our bowls, filled with salty <i class="calibre5">nước mắm</i>, and lets those babies sink in.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba gestures for it, chewing on his piece, as if to say, <i class="calibre5">Lay it
                        on me, woman.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How is school going? College applications?” Mẹ asks.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Nonexistent</i>, my brain answers, but I say, “Good.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We’d done our road-tripping last year, visiting mostly state schools so that it’s
                    cheaper. My scores might be able to get me into some of them, though there aren’t any guarantees. At
                    least my parents know that.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Just make sure your grades are steady and you don’t go under.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sure.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ lets out another sigh.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Con, do you have any idea what you want to do? What major yet?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mẹ, that’s, like, a year away.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But isn’t it better to know now?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Plenty of students go into college undecided. It’s perfectly normal.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Dì Nhi”&mdash;the General&mdash;“said her son knew right away that he wanted to do
                    premed before going to Stanford.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Premed’s not a major, though.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I know! But what I mean is, he knew what he wanted to do.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I shift when I realize I’m sitting exactly like my mom, one leg bent on the chair.
                    I stretch out both legs and cross my arms. But then I notice that’s how Ba sits.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“A year will come quickly,” my mom continues.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m thinking of a lot of things.” Strangely, today’s journalism class pops into my
                    mind. The feeling of my grip around my pen, seeing the changes I made on the page, the moment I made
                    Allison shut up for once. I haven’t felt this way before.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Thinking is not the same as doing!” She leans back and turns to Ba. “Anh, tell
                    him.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Ừ</i>,” he says in agreement. My mom
                    stares at him reproachfully, probably hoping he’ll say something more inspiring.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She gives a long-suffering sigh. “Mẹ wonder what Việt is planning to major in.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Given his attention to criminal TV shows and his near-obsession with getting into
                    forensic science class, I’d figured that was his intention. But he hasn’t really said anything, even
                    though it shouldn’t be an issue with him. The kid doesn’t study and has probably never studied,
                    because his pores just absorb all the knowledge on a page. “I don’t know. Ask him next time you see
                    him.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Việt is so smart.” My mom nods in approval.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Brilliant,” Ba agrees.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“His parents must be so proud.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Not for the rst time, I wonder if my parents would be happier to have him as a son.
                    Their eyes are practically glazed over at the mention of him.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Annoyed, I say, “Maybe you can adopt him, then.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Con,” my mother says, her voice turning sweet in a way that bugs me. Pleading,
                    almost. “We just think you can do anything. And you have to <i class="calibre5">cố gắng</i>.” She
                    pauses to inhale.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Here we go.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You know, con, when we die&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mẹ&mdash;” I plead.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“When we die&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“In, like, fty years!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ talks louder. “Ba Mẹ just want con to be able to support yourself. But that
                    means trying.” She gestures to her and Ba, who nods like he’s confirming, <i class="calibre5">Yes, I
                        will die</i>, <i class="calibre5">son</i>. “Con don’t know how lucky you are. When Mẹ arrived in
                    this country back in 1982, Mẹ was three years younger than you. Only <i class="calibre5">mười bốn
                        tuổi</i>! <i class="calibre5">Không biết</i> what was going to happen. But Mẹ learned. Mẹ
                    adapted. Same with Ba. We trusted our education and we only want you to do the same.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I duck my head, eating the last bit of <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>, and
                    feeling like the biggest asshole. But low blow, using her escape story. I can’t really say anything
                    in response to that. How can I, when she mentioned everything she’d lost? Her home, plenty of
                    relatives&mdash;including her older brother, who attempted escape before her, but died during the
                    passage.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-34" class="calibre12">In rare moments, she would say that I look like him, like Cậu
                    Cam. We have the same hair, she says. I can tell how much it hurts her to mention him because she
                    either goes silent or quickly moves on to mention something else. I never know what to say when that
                    happens.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Before my mom goes on to talk about her night of the escape&mdash;the last
                    recitation having been one hour and forty minutes long&mdash;I relent with an “Okay. Okay. I promise
                    I’ll focus.” I breathe in. “I’ll do better.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ brightens and shares a look with Ba, her guilt trip a success. It’s like I
                    solved all her worries&mdash;past, present, and future. “You can be anything!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Maybe a doctor,” my dad o ers, nally edging a word in.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">… <i class="calibre5">with the most malpractice lawsuits</i>, I finish as I carry my
                    plates to the sink.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom starts clearing away the other dishes, and she’s already on to the next task
                    on her list, a nonstop machine. She asks me if I want to take anything to school tomorrow. <i
                        class="calibre5">No? Why? It wasn’t good enough?</i> I relent and tell her maybe a few pieces of
                    <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>, sans sh sauce. Turning to my dad, who’s still digging away at his
                    teeth with a <i class="calibre5">tăm</i>, she reminds him that they’ll need to wake at ve in the
                    morning to receive Việt’s parents’ delivery, so the alarm needs to be set. Ba tells her to stop
                    reminding him: <i class="calibre5">Bà nói điếc lỗ tai</i>. Which only means she’ll continue to
                    pester him to purposefully get on his nerves. Her type of revenge.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I leave them, the thoughts about my promise to them&mdash;<i class="calibre5">to do
                        better&mdash;</i>running rampant in my mind.</p>
