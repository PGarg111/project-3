                <h3>Chapter 21</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">I’ve been thinking about Linh’s hand a lot, her paint-marked hand fitting into my
                    palm. I remember it like it was a living heart, pulsing. I’ve replayed that moment we noticed what
                    was happening and decided not to care, the moment that I knew we’d stepped into a new place without
                    planning to. I wish there was a word stronger than “palpable,” but I guess that was sufficient for
                    now.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">When she let go, I wanted so badly to snatch her hand back. When she muttered a
                    quick goodbye to me, I wanted to tell her not to leave. We couldn’t just ignore what happened.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She didn’t pull away. She could have, but she didn’t. Does that mean she feels the
                    same way as me?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt and Ali had seen it before us, apparently.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The next week, to my disappointment, unfolds like the days before our worlds
                    collided on Phở Day. Our schedule consists of way too many misses. At lunch, when I stop by the art
                    room, I don’t nd her there. I know for a fact that Linh’s avoiding me, because she skipped the next
                    restaurant coverage, mentioning it to Ali, who told me she was overwhelmed by work and painting.
                    There’s truth in that, I’m sure, but not completely.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She’s scared, and I wish I could tell her that I am, too. That I don’t know how
                    things will work. But if we could hold hands a bit longer, maybe we’ll figure it out.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I had to go alone to a Malaysian restaurant, while most of the customers enjoyed
                    meals among large families. They must have felt sorry for me, a high school boy, dining out alone.
                    The chef gave me a doggy bag of some kind of cookies that Ba demolished later in the night.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre12">As we sit across the table at 10:00 p.m., feeling Mẹ’s
                    absence as she was still at a friend’s house for a mani and pedi, I have this ridiculous thought to
                    ask for advice. <i class="calibre5">Ba is a man. Ba has experienced things like this… right?</i>
                    Then I stop the idea almost immediately. I must be getting desperate if I think it’s a good pick to
                    ask my dad, stone-cold Dad, for girl advice when we don’t exactly enjoy small talk in general.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Tonight must be different, because Ba starts the small talk anyway. Those cookies
                    must be good.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We’re going to need your help in the next few weeks at the restaurant.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, okay. What’s happening?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Your mom and I are planning a <i class="calibre5">Bánh Xèo</i> Day to introduce different kinds of <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> to the menu. So things will be busy.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Just like Việt had suggested.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Did Việt mention anything to you?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why would he?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Never mind.” I think about the special. Linh’s family&mdash;Linh&mdash;are going
                    to see it as a direct response to their Phở Day. Great: One more reason for our parents to despise
                    one another.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why now?” I ask warily.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“To make sure our customers don’t get tired of our menus.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Will it work? We don’t usually do different kinds of <i class="calibre5">bánh
                        xèo</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We never really know when things will work. We weren’t sure a restaurant would
                    work, but here we are. There is no use playing it safe when it comes to our restaurant.” Ba gets up
                    and puts on the teakettle. He shu es to the cabinet where we keep various tins of tea leaves. <i
                        class="calibre5">“Muốn trà không?”</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">I shake my head, thinking tea will only keep me up later than I should.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Playing it safe.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">If my dad’s willing to do something that might not bring him any sure result, maybe
                    I can do the same.</p>
                <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000008.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                <p id="calibre_link-141" class="calibre1">Later I stared for longer than I’d like to admit at a text to
                    send to Linh. A text asking her to meet again, face-to-face. I wasn’t as blunt; I had a good reason
                    to text her, since Ali sent me another restaurant to visit. So I mentioned that to her.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Then her bubbles begin to appear, so I shut down the Messages app, until a ring
                    tells me to read it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">sorry to be MIA. your article on that
                            malaysian place was great.</b></span></p>
