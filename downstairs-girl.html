                    <p>
                        By day, seventeen-year-old Jo Kuan works as a lady's maid for the cruel daughter of one of the wealthiest men in Atlanta. But by night, Jo moonlights as the pseudonymous author of a newspaper advice column for the genteel Southern lady, "Dear Miss Sweetie." When her column becomes wildly popular, she uses the power of the pen to address some of society's ills, but she's not prepared for the backlash that follows when her column challenges fixed ideas about race and gender. While her opponents clamor to uncover the secret identity of Miss Sweetie, a mysterious letter sets Jo off on a search for her own past and the parents who abandoned her as a baby. But when her efforts put her in the crosshairs of Atlanta's most notorious criminal, Jo must decide whether she, a girl used to living in the shadows, is ready to step into the light. With prose that is witty, insightful, and at times heartbreaking, Stacey Lee masterfully crafts an extraordinary social drama set in the New South.

                <article>
                    <h2>One</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Being nice is like leaving your door wide-open.
                            Eventually,</span> someone’s going to mosey in and steal your best hat. Me, I have only one
                        hat and it is uglier than a smashed crow, so if someone stole it, the joke would be on their
                        head, literally. Still, boundaries must be set. Especially boundaries over one’s worth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Today I will demand a raise.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You’re making that pavement twitchy the way you’re staring at it.” Robby
                        Withers shines his smile on me. Ever since the traveling dentist who pulled Robby’s rotting
                        molar told him he would lose more if he didn’t scrub his teeth regularly, he has brushed twice
                        daily, and he expects me to do it, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Pavement is underappreciated for all it does to smooth the way,” I tell his
                        laughing eyes, which are brown like eagle’s feathers, same as his skin. “We should be more
                        grateful.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby gestures grandly at the ground. “Pavement, we’re much obliged, despite
                        all the patty cakes we dump on you.” He pulls me away from a pile of manure. It was Robby’s
                        mother who nursed me when I was a baby, God rest her soul. And it was she who told Old Gin about
                        the secret basement under the print shop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Whitehall Street, the “spine” of Atlanta, rises well above the treetops with
                        her stately brick and imposing stone buildings&mdash;along with the occasional Victorian house
                        that refuses to give up her seat at the table. Business is good here, and like the longleaf pine
                        forests, being burned by Sherman’s troops a quarter century ago only made the city grow back
                        stronger.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You look different today.” I pretend to appraise him from his cap to his tan
                        trousers. “You forget something?” It is rare to see him without the mule and cart he uses as a
                        deliveryman for Buxbaum’s Department Store.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-58" class="calibre21">“They’re down a clerk. Mr. Buxbaum’s letting me fill in
                        until they find someone new.” He straightens his pin-striped jacket, though it’s already
                        straight enough to measure with.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You don’t say.” Mr. Buxbaum is popular among whites and colored alike, but
                        hiring a colored clerk isn’t done in these parts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If I do a good job, maybe he’ll let me fill in on a more permanent basis.” He
                        gives me a tight smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If you don’t stick your foot out, you’ll never advance. You’d be perfect for
                        the job. I myself am fixing to ask Mrs. English for a raise.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He whistles, a short low sound. “If Mrs. English had any sense, she’d give it
                        to you. Of course, common sense was never very common in these parts.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nod, a surge of righteous blood flooding my veins. Two years I have worked as
                        a milliner’s assistant at the same wage of fifty cents a day. Measly. It is already 1890. Plus,
                        Old Gin has lost too much weight, and I need to buy him medicine&mdash;not a booty ball or
                        buckeye powder, but something legitimate. And legitimate costs money.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">One of the newly electric streetcars approaches, bringing by an audience of
                        Southerners in various stages of confusion at the sight of me. An Eastern face in Western
                        clothes always sets the game wheels to spinning between curiosity and disapproval. Most of the
                        time, the pointer lands on disapproval. I should charge them for the privilege of ogling me. Of
                        course, I’d have to split the fee with Robby, whose six-foot height also draws attention, even
                        as he keeps his eyes on the sidewalk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He stops walking and squares his cap so that it’s flat enough to play chess on.
                        “Here’s my stop. Good luck, Jo.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thanks, but keep some for yourself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He winks, then slips down a narrow alley to use the back door to Buxbaum’s. Old
                        Gin tells me things have changed for the worse since I was born. After good ol’ President Hayes
                        returned the South to “home rule,” Dems told colored people they should use the back alleys from
                        then on, which pretty much sums up everything.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Fluffing the sleeves of my russet dress, which have lost their puff and hang
                        like a pair of deflated lungs, I carry myself a block farther to English’s Millinery. The shop
                        stands between a candle maker and a seed store, meaning it can smell like a Catholic church or
                        alfalfa, depending on which way the wind blows. This morning, however, the air is still too
                        crisp to hold a scent. The picture windows are as clear as our Lord’s eyes&mdash;how I left them
                        last night&mdash;with several mauve hats displayed. Mauve is having a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Instead of going through the front, I also trek to the back entrance. Folks
                        care less about which door Chinese people use nowadays, compared with when the laborers were
                        shipped in to replace the field slaves after the war. Perhaps whites feel the same way about us
                        as they do about ladybugs: A few are fine, but a swarm turns the stomach.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-59" class="calibre21">Three boxes have been left by the back door, and I gather
                        them in my arms, then enter. The sight of Lizzie trying on the nearly finished “sensible” hat
                        I’d been designing stops me in my tracks. What is she doing here so early? She barely traipses
                        in at nine, when the shop opens, and it’s not even a quarter past eight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good morning.” I set the boxes on our worktable, which is already weighed down
                        with reams of felt. The broadsides for the charity horse race are barely dry, and orders are
                        already flooding in. Fashion is supposed to rest on Lent, but God will surely make an exception
                        for the event of the year. The proprietress will probably want me to stay late again or work
                        during the lunch hour so she can sneak off to nip her coca cordial. Well, not without a raise, I
                        won’t.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mrs. English wants to speak with you,” Lizzie says in her breathy voice. She
                        smooths a hand down the rooster tail I’d pinned to the sensible hat with an eternity knot.
                        Ringlets of strawberry-blond hair play peekaboo under the saucer brim.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I remove my floor-length cloak and black hat, one of the misfits that Mrs.
                        English let me purchase at a discount, this one made possible through Lizzie’s clumsy hands.
                        Then I tie on a lace apron.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The velvet curtain separating the store from the workroom jerks to one side,
                        and Mrs. English bustles in. “There you are,” she says in her haughty schoolmarm’s voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I dust off my drab shop cap. “Good morning, ma’am. I had an idea. What if,
                        instead of wearing these toadstools, we model our latest styles? See how fetching my sensible
                        hat looks on Lizzie&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. English frowns. “Put the toadstools on, both of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am,” Lizzie and I say in unison. I slip my cap over my head. I should
                        ask now, <i class="calibre7">before</i> she asks me to stay late, so my request does not appear
                        a hair-trigger reaction. I wipe my palms on my skirt. “Mrs. English&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo, I will no longer be requiring your services.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I&mdash;” I clamp my mouth shut when her words catch up to me. No longer
                        required . . . I’m . . . dismissed?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I only need one shopgirl, and Lizzie will do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Lizzie draws in a sharp breath. Her normally sleepy eyes open wide enough to
                        catch gnats.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Lizzie, open the packages. I hope the new boater block’s in one of them.” Mrs.
                        English wiggles her fingers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am.” Drawers clatter as Lizzie rummages for a knife.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“B-but&mdash;” I turn my back on Lizzie and lower my pipes to a whisper. “Mrs.
                        English, I <i class="calibre7">trained</i> her. I can felt a block twice as fast as her, I’m
                        never late, and you said I have an eye for color.” I can’t lose this job. It took me almost two
                        years to find steady work after my last dismissal, and Old Gin’s meager wage as a groom isn’t
                        enough to sustain us both. We’d be back to living hand to mouth, tiptoeing on the edges of
                        disaster. A bubble of hysteria works up my chest, but I slowly breathe it out.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-60" class="calibre21">At least we have a home. It’s dry, warm, and rent-free,
                        one of the perks of living secretly in someone else’s basement. As long as you have a home, you
                        have a place to plan and dream.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The woman sighs, something she does often. Her great bosom has a personality of
                        its own, at times riding high, and at times twitchy and nervous, like when the mayor’s wife pays
                        a visit. Today’s gusting tests the iron grip of her corset. Her rheumy eyes squint up at me
                        towering over her. “You make some of the ladies uncomfortable.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Each of the syllables slaps me on the cheeks, <i
                            class="calibre7">un-com-for-ta-ble</i>, and mortification pours like molten iron from my
                        face to my toes. But I’m <i class="calibre7">good</i> at my job. The solicitor’s wife even
                        called the silk knots I tied for her bonnet “extraordinary.” So what about me causes such
                        offense? I wash regularly with soap, even the parts that don’t show. I keep my black hair neatly
                        braided and routinely scrub my teeth with a licorice root, thanks to Robby. I’m not sluggish
                        like Lizzie or overbearing like Mrs. English. In fact, I’m the least offensive member of our
                        crew.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s because I’m . . .” My hand flies to my cheek, dusky and smooth as the
                        Asian steppes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I know you can’t help it. It’s the lot you drew.” She matches her round eyes
                        with mine, which are just as round, but taper at the outside corners. “But it’s not just that.
                        You’re . . . a saucebox.” She squints at my cap, and I regret calling it a toadstool. “You don’t
                        know when to keep your opinions to yourself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She draws back her head, causing her neck to bunch. “Women want to be
                        complimented. They do not want to be told they look washed-out, square in the jaw, or
                        pie-faced.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If a hat made me look pie-faced, I would certainly want to know before I
                        purchased it. Lizzie routinely gives opinions. Just last week, she told a woman with a lumpy
                        head that maybe she should give up wearing hats entirely. Mrs. English only smiled. I’m about to
                        give my opinion of her opinion, but that would only prove her point. “I only wished to help them
                        find the best fit.” I try to keep a tight grip on my indignation, but my voice trembles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, the simple fact is you are not the best fit here. Today will be your
                        last day. Don’t make this harder than it needs to be. I am sure you will have no trouble getting
                        a job as a lady’s maid or some such.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A lady’s maid? I suck in my breath. Now, that would be a fall backward, not
                        that someone like me can be choosy.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre21">“Not a hatter’s apprentice, of course,” she jabs the pin
                        in deeper. “I have already talked to the Sixteen, and they will not hire you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Despite being competitors, the sixteen milliners that dress Atlanta’s heads are
                        tight as hatbands. Something bangs on the floor, but Lizzie’s apologies for dropping the boater
                        block sound far away. I have been blacklisted. Servants are routinely blacklisted when their
                        services come to an end, even when they have done nothing to deserve it, except working their
                        fingers to the breaking point each day, coming in early, leaving late, cleaning up other
                        people’s messes, painstakingly redoing their stitches. I can barely breathe. “B-but, I&mdash;”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I can’t risk you spilling my secrets.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The door chimes clang, and Mrs. English scurries back to the front.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Tears gather in my eyes, and I press my sleeves to them before they fall. And I
                        had once thought Mrs. English kind for taking a chance on me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The proprietress pokes her head back into the workroom. “Jo, a lady is asking
                        for you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I swallow the lump in my throat. “Me?” No one has ever asked for me. And it’s a
                        little early for customers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The precise words were ‘the Chinese girl,’ and so I had to give it my best
                        shot. Don’t dawdle.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I dry my face and follow her into the shop. On the other side of the oak
                        counter stands a woman in a gray suit with a modest bustle and a white blouse with a high
                        collar. Narrow shoulders slope into an equally narrow neck, a pointed chin, and high cheekbones.
                        Her prematurely white hair is tied into a practical knot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I gasp. It’s Mrs. Bell, my upstairs neighbor. Though we have kept our existence
                        secret from the printer and his family, I have stolen glances at them through the print shop
                        window. Her flannel-gray eyes spread over me, and I can almost hear the underground walls of our
                        home caving in. Outside, a whip cracks. A mule brays, and the last of my hopes seem to stampede
                        away.</p>

                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">“This is Mrs. Bell. Well, don’t just stand there. Speak,
                            girl.” Mrs.</span> English puts her fists on her hips. Even her bosom seems to glare at me,
                        frozen in front of her. Has the woman come to have me arrested? If it were discovered that two
                        Chinese people were squatting in her basement, we could be imprisoned or worse. In this part of
                        the world, mobs form as easily and violently as cloudbusters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ma’am, how do you do?” I force my face into something pleasant or, at least,
                        less grim. Act natural. If she’s looking for the Chinese girl who’s been tunneling under her,
                        she’s got the wrong one, never mind I’m the only one for miles and miles. My twitchy fingers
                        pluck a fan from a basket. “Nice weather we’re having.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-62" class="calibre21">Mrs. English snatches the fan and glares at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Er, yes,” says Mrs. Bell, despite the gloom outside. Now that I am forced to
                        face the woman, I have to admit, she appears more bemused than angry, her dark eyebrows
                        steepling, her mouth halfway ajar. She unpins her hat from her head&mdash;a simple spooner in
                        mourning-dove gray&mdash;and sets it on the counter. “I have been admiring the knot
                        embellishment on my friend’s hat, and she said it was made by the Chinese girl who works here.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The solicitor’s wife? I stop fidgeting. Perhaps our residence is still a
                        secret.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell gestures at her hat. “I was hoping you could do the same for me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. English clears her throat. “Actually, she is busy.” Her eyes flit to a
                        familiar folder beside the cash register. “We’re taking inventory today.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My jaw grinds. That tedious chore is typically done on Friday, but she’s trying
                        to get her money’s worth out of my last day. Lizzie never gets the numbers to come out right.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But,” she adds, “I would be happy to assist you myself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell’s head pulls back a notch as she addresses Mrs. English. “<i
                            class="calibre7">You</i> can do the Chinese knots, too?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Er, no.” The proprietress’s mouth draws in like a purse string being cinched.
                        She had thought my knots looked bizarre, but didn’t complain when the solicitor’s wife paid her
                        handsomely for the work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I would be happy to do it,” I cautiously pipe up. If Mrs. Bell has come to
                        arrest me, where is the constable? The shock of my dismissal may have dulled my perception, but
                        the woman’s behavior doesn’t strike me as someone who has smoked out a rat. In addition, the
                        prospect of sticking Lizzie with the inventory makes me positively giddy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But the embellishment will take more than a day,” Mrs. English says with a
                        meaningful jab of her eyebrow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell presses her palms together. “Oh, take your time. I don’t need it for
                        a couple of weeks.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I can do it in a day.” I steer a brave smile toward the proprietress, hoping
                        to unearth a pebble of pity in her stony heart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. English fans herself. Waves of gardenia crash over us. “If you pay in
                        cash, I would reconsider.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ah. I might have something even better than cash.” Mrs. Bell fingers the edge
                        of her hat. Her arthritic joints stretch the fabric of her well-worn gloves, and the pads of her
                        fingers are starting to show through. Money is tight in that family. I hold my breath, caught
                        between wondering what she could offer and worrying that there is more to this visit than meets
                        the eye. “You see, my husband runs the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>. In exchange for the work,
                        we could give you a month of advertisement, the equivalent of three dollars. I am told the piece
                        cost a dollar fifty. You’d be getting twice the value.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-63" class="calibre21">“Front page,” Mrs. English briskly counters. “Plus
                        assurances that you will not run competing advertisements.” When Mrs. Bell doesn’t answer, the
                        proprietress pours on some charm. “Each piece that leaves our hands is a unique work of art. But
                        don’t go to New York, or the Metropolitan Museum might pinch it from you.” She bats her fan at
                        Mrs. Bell. No one butters a biscuit like Mrs. English.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell’s genteel smile doesn’t falter, but her finger spools a loose thread
                        on her sleeve. “A one-week exclusive is all I can offer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The two women continue to haggle, though Mrs. Bell’s eyes keep wandering to me.
                        I untwist my arms and try not to look like I’m hiding something. Unlike the proprietress, whose
                        speech modulates like a stage actress’s, the publisher’s wife’s voice is as steady as an oak
                        table. It comforts me, even as I worry about the coincidence of her visit. I’m reminded of all
                        those songs she sang to calm Nathan, songs that also soothed me, two years younger than him. Her
                        tales of growing up on her parents’ sheep farm enthralled me in ways I never expected sheep
                        could do. And here she stands before me, unaware&mdash;at least I hope&mdash;of how much she
                        means to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Two young women enter the shop dressed in the latest pastels with touches of
                        lace at the collars. Miss Melissa Lee Saltworth and Miss Linette Culpepper, whom I call Salt and
                        Pepper, though never aloud, are the daughters of “merchant aristocrats.” Unlike the older cities
                        of Savannah and Charleston, in Atlanta you don’t need a family name to boost your social
                        standing. You can climb the ladder by sheer business muscle. Of course, muscles, business or
                        otherwise, never made a difference to how high Chinese could climb.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good morning, Miss Saltworth, Miss Culpepper. How are you today?” Mrs. English
                        calls over her shoulder into the back room, “Lizzie?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Lizzie appears. “Why, good morning, Mrs. Bell. How is Nathan? I haven’t seen
                        him delivering the papers at Father’s store lately.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He is well, Lizzie. The reporting keeps him very busy these days. I shall tell
                        him you send your regards.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Lizzie lingers at the counter, a dreamy smile upon her fair face. Mrs. English
                        clears her throat loudly and cocks her head meaningfully toward Salt and Pepper. Lizzie takes
                        languid steps toward the ladies as if the floor were full of horse patties. The building could
                        be burning down and she would still take her time. Salt points to the top shelf, where we
                        display the finest offerings, and with a wooden pole, Lizzie retrieves a straw hat in mauve with
                        a cloud of tulle.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre21">I bite my tongue in frustration. Mauve would definitely
                        clash with Salt’s peachy skin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A two-week exclusive, then. I hope there will be nothing more,” Mrs. Bell adds
                        with more force.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. English nods at me, a triumphant gleam in her eye. Mrs. Bell’s gaze also
                        travels to me. I summon some poise, not wanting her to think me a heathen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Did you have a particular event in mind, or is it for everyday wear?” I ask,
                        my tongue strangely thick.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I would like something unique, a conversation starter. It’s for the horse
                        race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt, who’s been admiring the straw hat in Lizzie’s hands, exclaims, “I’m
                        fizzed about that race. We came as early as we could.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pepper twirls her parasol with such energy, she might have been divining the
                        ground for water. “I hope your Mr. Q invites you soon.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt blushes like a sunset against the white-blond clouds of her locks.
                        According to Pepper, Mr. Quackenbach, the son of a financier who lost his fortune backing
                        Confederate dollars, is “smitten” with Miss Saltworth and seeking her hand. The Quackenbach name
                        still holds currency even if his bank account does not, and Mr. Q has the sort of dreamy face
                        that could ripple even the sourest buttermilk. If I were as wealthy as Salt, the only thing I
                        would give a gold digger like Mr. Q is my foot. Anyway, according to Old Gin, the real looker is
                        his horse, a rare piebald with a white coat offset by a black mane and tail.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell nods at the newcomers. “Actually, ladies are encouraged to ask the
                        men. We printed the posters ourselves.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, but no respectable woman would actually do that,” says Mrs. English.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell looses a smile. “The proceeds benefit the Society for the Betterment
                        of Women. Perhaps it is appropriate in this instance.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt pushes the mauve hat back at Lizzie, to my relief. “But it’s so bold. What
                        if the gentleman refused? I should be humiliated.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He won’t.” Pepper tucks a black ringlet back under her crushed-velvet capote,
                        a hat I made just last week.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It sounds wonderful,” Lizzie breathes, squeezing the mauve hat so hard, I
                        think I hear it whimper. I expect Mrs. English to reprimand her, but instead, she’s staring at
                        the cash register, a smile fanned across her face. Perhaps she’s remembering all the orders the
                        horse race is generating. A tiny bubble of hope rises in my chest, pesky thing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9"> SPEND MY </span>last hours as a
                        milliner in the back room, creating Mrs. Bell’s embellishment. Lucky Yip, one of the two
                        “uncles” I remember, taught me the folk art of knot-tying one summer when a cloudbuster made it
                        difficult to leave the basement. All you need is silk cord and your fingers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell’s plain felt sports a duck brim in front and a lifted back for her
                        hair. To wake up its dull planes, I work cord into rose and pansy knots. I add green ribbons to
                        suggest foliage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The first time I was sacked, I’d been polishing banisters at the prestigious
                        Payne Estate, where Old Gin had worked ever since stepping foot on American soil twenty years
                        earlier. I had grown up on the estate, working first as a stable girl and sometimes playmate to
                        the Paynes’ spoiled daughter, until I was promoted to a housemaid. The linseed oil was still
                        slick on my fingers when Mrs. Payne snatched my rag and pointed it toward the door: “Go.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">At least Mrs. English had given a reason for dismissing me. Not a good one, but
                        it beat no reason at all.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Lizzie drifts in from the front. Her breathy sighs pelt me from behind. The
                        butterfly I’m knotting slips, and I throw her a wet look. “May I help you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It shoulda been me. I don’t love this job like you do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I deflate, wishing she would make it easier for me to dislike her. “Once you
                        get the hang of things, you’ll like it better.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She glances toward the shop, which, judging by the chatter, is full of patrons.
                        Instead of leaving, she drops into a chair. “I bet that horse race will be fine as fox fur.” She
                        intertwines her fingers and her shoulders lift.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I cannot help musing that the world would be a happier place if we could all do
                        the things we want to do. I like making hats. I do not want to be a maid to a spoiled Southern
                        miss. Lizzie does not want to make hats. She wants to <i class="calibre7">be</i> the spoiled
                        Southern miss. As for Mrs. English, her life would be easier if she just kept me and got rid of
                        Lizzie. At least I would make her profitable.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A few more twists complete my butterfly, its wings spread as if to fly. I am
                        just putting the finishing stitches in my arrangement when Mrs. Bell returns.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s lovelier than I could’ve imagined.” Mrs. Bell turns her head from side to
                        side in front of our mirror. “It’s a miracle you finished it so fast!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I resist checking for Mrs. English’s reaction as she completes a row of sums
                        next to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you, ma’am. You should always wear a little color, because&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. English clears her throat loudly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I bite my tongue, realizing this is the kind of opining that cooked my goose.
                        “Because, well, we all should.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell smiles and holds out a nickel to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I&mdash;I couldn’t,” I stammer. I occasionally receive tips, but it doesn’t
                        feel right to take money from her when I owe her so much. Her smile wobbles, and I realize I am
                        acting suspicious. I accept the coin. “Thank you.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre21">She says in a low voice, “May God always keep you in His
                        palm.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With that, I am back to worrying that she does know about Old Gin and me. Has
                        she just given her implicit approval that the situation may continue? But why say something so
                        <i class="calibre7">final</i> unless she thought we would not meet again? Is she planning to
                        reveal us after all?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her face betrays nothing. She is back to admiring her hat in the reflection.

                    <h2>Three</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Mrs. English drops two Lady Libertys into my palm and
                            snaps the</span> cash register shut.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My tired fingers curl around the coins on their own. “Thank you. Ma’am, won’t
                        you reconsider?” I cringe at the desperation in my voice, but I’d hoped millinery held great
                        promise for me. Making hats, you could make statements without saying anything at all. Plus, a
                        hatter can pay her own way without marrying. A good Chinese wife is expected to cook, bear sons,
                        and be willing to “eat bitterness.” I have enough of that on my plate right now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’ll work twice as hard and try not to have so many opinions and&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo, you simply do not make economic sense.” With a handkerchief, she pats the
                        moisture from her neck, then swabs the space between us, as if to rub away the sight of me. I’m
                        reminded of the dreaded <i class="calibre7">G</i>-word that accompanied my last dismissal. But
                        instead of <i class="calibre7">go</i>, Mrs. English says, “Good luck.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Disappointment weighs heavy as a box of blocks on my heart. My chin quivers,
                        but I hide it under the brim of my hat as I hurry toward Union Station, a brick hangar with a
                        fan-shaped arch. The sooner I get home, the sooner I can eavesdrop on Mrs. Bell to ascertain
                        whether her visit was more than a coincidence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad was the first of several cuts in the pie
                        that divided Atlanta into six wards. We live near the center of the pie. A uniformed man herds a
                        noisy mass of carriages, carts, and pedestrians through the crossing. I hurry to make it through
                        before it closes. A woman holds a handkerchief to her nose and shrinks away from me, and I know
                        it is not the soot she is worried about.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre21">My feet tingle as I cross the tracks and I cast my eyes
                        toward Yankee country. North of the Mason-Dixon Line, even the dogs attend school for manners,
                        and in New York, women are so fashionable, they change hats several times a day. I could’ve
                        opened my own millinery in Madison Square, had I the right training.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Saucebox,</i> I snort. I barely utter one word to every ten
                        Lizzie speaks, and that’s the chattiest I get all day. Chinese people can’t afford to be
                        sauceboxes, especially Chinese people who are trying to live undetected.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh!” Past the tracks, I nearly collide with an old man perched upon a crate.
                        He jerks, and a newspaper hat slides off his head. “I am sorry.” I pick up the newspaper hat,
                        though he makes no move to take it from me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Pa, you a’right?” A young woman with sun-beaten skin snatches the newspaper
                        hat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The man’s yellowing eyes adhere to me like spots of glue. It occurs to me the
                        two might not have a home, given their open rucksacks and dirty fingernails. The woman bends the
                        hat back into shape and sets it gently onto her father’s head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Suddenly, I see Old Gin and myself in these two, reduced to begging, with not
                        even proper hats to shade us. <i class="calibre7">Please let it not come to that,</i> I implore
                        both the Christian God and our ancestors. The sky looks coolly down on me. Unlike yesterday,
                        there is no ombré in its sunset or tulle in its clouds. A thin puff of vapor resembles a
                        stuck-out tongue. I’m gripped by the urge to run headlong into the sky and wipe that smug off
                        its face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Like a common pickpocket, I slip along alleys, keeping myself compact and
                        unnoticeable. A copse of trees lies fifty yards beyond One Luckie Street, the home of the Bells’
                        print shop and attached house. Checking to see that no one is looking, I hasten to the center of
                        the copse, where the heavy skirts of a Virginia cedar conceal a trapdoor. The door does not
                        creak when I open it&mdash; we always keep it well-oiled. A rough staircase leads to one of the
                        two tunnels looping to the basement under One Luckie Street.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin is perched, birdlike, at our spool table, home earlier than usual.
                        Eavesdropping will have to wait. The Bells are probably in their kitchen eating dinner anyway,
                        not in the print shop where I can overhear them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Evening, Father.” Lately, Old Gin’s garments have begun to hang on him, dark
                        trousers and a shirt whose original color is hard to recall. With even strokes, he writes
                        Chinese characters for me to copy. We use English with the uncles gone, but he wants me to keep
                        up the mother tongue for the husband he hopes to find me one day.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His threadbare eyebrows hitch a fraction. Even at the barely audible volume
                        that we use underground, he can tell I’m cross. It heaps insult onto injury that I can’t rail
                        about my unjust situation at the volume it deserves. I scrub my hands and face in our wash
                        bucket with more vigor than necessary, soaking my sleeves. Then I seat myself on the upside-down
                        flowerpot I use as a chair, my knees bumping the table.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre21">Old Gin has arranged on my plate two slices of ham, a
                        wedge of cheese, one sesame seed roll, and a dish of peach preserves. Robby’s wife, Noemi, the
                        Paynes’ cook, always gives Old Gin something extra to take home. We eat simply, avoiding foods
                        that might release suspicious smells into the environment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It is better to save anger for tomorrow, hm?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I sigh. Old Gin knows just how to press the valves that release steam. “Mrs.
                        English dismissed me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">While I pour out my story, he sips hot barley water, peppering my pauses with
                        the musical <i class="calibre7">hm</i>s that both loosen my speech and rob it of indignation.
                        The <i class="calibre7">hm</i> appears so frequently that I forget it’s there. I think it comes
                        from spending so much time with horses. “Hm?” is his way of showing them that he values their
                        opinions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Guess it’s the cotton mills for me,” I mutter. The mills will hire anyone
                        willing to work long hours spinning or spooling. Of course, it might cost a finger, or worse,
                        one’s life, which is why they’re called “widow makers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin’s horrified gasp sets off another bout of coughing, and I immediately
                        regret my words. It’s as if someone had grabbed ahold of his thin shoulders and is shaking him
                        for loose change. It must be the damp. His old corner gets musty when it rains too much.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I travel the two steps to our “kitchen” to fetch the kettle off our
                        coal-burning stove. The stove shares a chimney with the fireplace in the print shop overhead,
                        which means we only use it when that fireplace is lit. Lucky for us, the printer’s wife prefers
                        a warm room for her arthritis.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pour more barley tea. Old Gin nods his thanks, his acorn-shaped face red and
                        grimacing. The spasms have mussed his neatly kept gray hair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Robby says some of the new drafts are quite effective for the cough.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Best draft is time.” His gaze strays to an old pair of work boots neatly lined
                        against the wall, where we hide our money. We have always been frugal, but lately Old Gin has
                        become as tightfisted as a man gearing up to throw a punch. Last month, I lost a quarter out of
                        a hole in my pocket, and he didn’t sleep well for a week. “We must save for your future.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Our future.” Old Gin is not my real father, and yet I cannot imagine a world
                        without him by my side. Whoever my parents were, they must have known he was the most reliable
                        of the Chinese bachelors in Atlanta when they left me with him. A former schoolteacher in China,
                        Old Gin taught me everything he knew. The handful of “uncles” whom Old Gin permitted to live
                        with us&mdash;fieldworkers, ditchdiggers, and rock drillers&mdash;took turns watching my infant
                        self, but it was Old Gin who paid Robby’s mother to nurse me. It was Old Gin who stayed when the
                        others moved on.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-69" class="calibre21">He sips his tea, chest calm once again. “Yes, our future.”
                        He inhales a slow breath and sets down the tea. “How would you like to work for the Paynes
                        again?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I snort too loudly, but his face doesn’t alter its expression. “You are
                        serious?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin nods. “You could see Noemi every day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That would be nice, but&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“And you will be able to ride Sweet Potato.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Our mare’s coal-black face appears in my mind. Old Gin had begged Mr. Payne not
                        to let the head groom, Jed Crycks, shoot her as a foal after a lame leg caused her mother to
                        reject her. Mr. Payne agreed, giving her to Old Gin and even letting him board her at the estate
                        as long as Old Gin paid her keep.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She has grown into a fine animal,” he adds. “Smart, like you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Aside from the awkwardness of being dismissed, a job at the Payne Estate is
                        nothing to sneer at, with its luxurious surroundings, plentiful food, and a usually fair, albeit
                        distant mistress. Of course, Mrs. Payne’s daughter, Caroline, was a horse of a different color
                        altogether, but she was away at finishing school.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin swirls his cup, gazing at the contents.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Would Mrs. Payne really have me back? “Bad eggs, once tossed out, aren’t
                        usually put back in the basket.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin trains his placid gaze on the kerosene lamp above us, and it’s as if my
                        words are standing in line behind another thought. But after a moment, he says, “You were never
                        a bad egg.” He sniffs, as though verifying his claim. The sniff sets off a quake in his chest,
                        but he clamps his mouth shut, refusing to let the cough boil over. He lifts himself from his
                        milking stool and takes a moment to scoot it back in place. Instead of saying good night, he
                        nods, then pads creakily toward his “quarters.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After a rushed tidying, I retreat to my own corner under the print shop,
                        passing through the curtain door Old Gin had embroidered with horses. When the uncles moved
                        away, he suggested I move to a less noisy section under the main house where he lives, but I
                        love my snuggery, softened by a rug I braided out of old flannel. Not to mention, I refuse to be
                        parted from the speaking tube, the only way I can eavesdrop on the Bells.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After slipping into my nightgown and thick socks, I stretch over the raised
                        platform of my bed. From the opening above my pillow, I remove the wool plug that stops sound
                        from traveling up our end of the speaking tube.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A light draft flows in from above, and the flame in my oil lamp wavers from its
                        place on my crate nightstand. Mr. Bell’s three-beat pacing echoes down to me. Though I don’t
                        know the exact mathematical equation, Old Gin believes the “hearable” space encompasses the area
                        around the Bells’ worktable, roughly matching my corner.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre21">They’re arguing. I pray it has nothing to do with a
                        discovery of rats in the basement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sixteen hundred subscribers, while that fish wrapper the <i
                            class="calibre7">Trumpeter</i> has broken three thousand. Curse that ridiculous Advice from
                        Aunt Edna column,” thunders the publisher. “It’s embarrassing.” His voice only comes in two
                        levels: loud and louder. I imagine his ruddy face with its fleshy eye pads growing bright with
                        indignation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I release my breath. It pains me to hear Mr. Bell upset, but at least it is not
                        over Old Gin and me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Circulation for the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> has recently taken a
                        nosedive, after Nathan’s risky editorial criticizing a proposal to segregate Atlanta’s
                        streetcars, while the similar-size <i class="calibre7">Trumpeter</i> has soared, thanks to its
                        new agony aunt column. The family sheepdog, Bear, short for Forbearance, sounds out a hearty <i
                            class="calibre7">woof</i>, and her tail begins thumping. Unlike most sheepdogs, Bear’s tail
                        was never docked. I like to imagine the Great Shepherd put her heartbeat in her tail and wanted
                        it kept intact.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We could add more pictures,” says Nathan, pronouncing the last word <i
                            class="calibre7">pitchas</i>. Unlike his parents, who hail from New England, a light drawl
                        rubs some of the letters from his words. Old Gin says the Georgia accent rubbed off on me, too.
                        “The <i class="calibre7">Trumpeter</i> has at least two per page.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A waste of space. Pictures are for children.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The room falls silent. Even Bear’s tail stops thumping. I can almost feel the
                        rise in Nathan’s temperature, and my heart reaches for him. Nathan is my oldest friend, even if
                        he doesn’t know it. We have much in common, including a love of goobers (what Nathan calls
                        peanuts), a distaste for turnips, and a longing to be heard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Wood scrapes the floor, probably Nathan pouring himself into one of the
                        worktable chairs. I imagine him sketching out his frustration into one of his political
                        cartoons, art that could easily be featured in <i class="calibre7">Puck</i> magazine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Where is your article on hickory fungus?” Mr. Bell booms. “Folks want to know
                        why their trees are stunted.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m waiting for it to grow on me,” grumbles Nathan. If I had to have a husband
                        one day, I hope he would have a quick wit, like Nathan, minus his grouchiness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If it’s parasites you want,” he adds, “let me write that exposé on Billy
                        Riggs. The <i class="calibre7">Constitution</i>’s too gutless to write the real story.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The <i class="calibre7">Constitution</i> called Billy a “fixer,” but the Bells
                        believe Billy trades in dirty secrets. Last year, the heir to a bourbon fortune hanged himself
                        after a rival revealed the heir preferred the company of men. The Bells suspected the
                        information was bought and sold by Billy Riggs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Bell snorts loudly. “The end might be near, but I won’t be burnt at the
                        stake of scandal!”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-71" class="calibre21">“Yes, yes,” Mrs. Bell smooths. My ears perk up. Sometimes
                        it’s hard to tell if she’s in the room, as she walks with the heft of a mosquito. “Well,
                        there’ll be a scandal if you miss the early train. Better turn in now.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Bell always travels to New York in the spring to meet with the <i
                            class="calibre7">Focus</i>’s sponsors. The sound of grumbles is followed by footfalls as the
                        publisher departs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Eavesdropping is a vile habit. But I have been eavesdropping on the Bells ever
                        since I <i class="calibre7">had</i> ears, and I doubt I can change now. Their words comforted me
                        on many a lonely night and made me feel like part of a family. The abolitionists who built this
                        place cleverly disguised the upstairs end of the speaking tube to resemble a vent. Bet they
                        never expected someone like me would be eavesdropping. Who could’ve anticipated that when the
                        enslaved were freed, Chinese would be shipped in, not just to replace them on the plantations,
                        but to help rebuild the South?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A broom scratches the floor as Mrs. Bell wages her nightly war against carbon
                        soot. I imagine the straw bundle snooping under the worktable, the foot-operated press, and the
                        type case. Bear woofs, chasing the broom.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Let me do that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I <i class="calibre7">like</i> sweeping. Please, just humor your father. If
                        things don’t go well in New York, it won’t matter what we write.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What do you mean, ‘if things don’t go well’?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hold my breath, my fingers twisted into my flannel nightgown.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Most of our Northern sponsors have given up floating a paper down here. If we
                        don’t return to two thousand subscribers by April, we are done.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But April’s only four weeks away. We’d need a hundred new subscribers a week.
                        Impossible.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Maybe it’s time for us to move to Aunt Susannah’s&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We’re not alfalfa farmers. I don’t even like alfalfa. It’s a joke of a word.
                        Rearrange the letters and it’s a-laf-laf. Those sponsors need to give us more time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I worry a hole into the toe of my sock. Never did it occur to me that the Bells
                        might move. Is that why she came to Mrs. English’s? To give me an implicit goodbye?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What does the <i class="calibre7">Trumpeter</i> have that we lack?” asks
                        Nathan.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell snorts. “Advice from Aunt Edna.” Her broom scratches even harder.
                        “Well, maybe we’ll get more subscriptions at that horse race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The race kicks off debutante season, and everyone who lives on the top branch
                        will want to be seen. Those of us on the bottom branch would be content just to see the horses,
                        but tickets cost two dollars each.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What did you say?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I press the right side of my head up against the opening.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I said, maybe we’ll get more&mdash;”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre21">“No, before that. Advice from Aunt Edna. If we had an
                        agony aunt column, we could improve our readership. What do women, er, like? Laundry tips?” He
                        lets out half a grunt. Probably his mother pinched him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sometimes you’re as dense as your father.” Bear adds a <i
                            class="calibre7">woof!</i> “Women get enough household advice from Aunt Edna. Someone should
                        write about meatier topics. Like how to get a bunion of a husband to listen to you. Or what to
                        do if the butcher tries to gull you with an inferior cut of meat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Gull</i>. Such a great word, though I doubt the seagulls
                        love having their good name tied to trickery. I’ll add it to the <i class="calibre7">G</i>-words
                        I chalked on my wall. Mr. Payne gave Old Gin our dictionary, which is intact except for the <i
                            class="calibre7">G</i> section, so I give those words a place here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why don’t you write one?” Nathan asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’d have to run it by your father.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan groans. “Forget I mentioned it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The upstairs grows silent, and I plug the listening tube. We are careful never
                        to leave the open tube unattended.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If the Bells go out of business, they would leave, and they are like family.
                        Old Gin might even decide it’s time to find me a husband with a “fleshy nose,” the kind thought
                        to accumulate wealth. Chinese bachelors are so desperate for wives, they spend hundreds of
                        dollars fetching them from China, many younger than my seventeen years. I’d have my pick of
                        noses and all the bitterness I could stomach.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">The next morning, I don my russet dress and button my
                            pebbled-</span>goat-leather boots. Then I take the western corridor up to the “tree” exit,
                        assailed by the scent of wet dirt and tree roots. It must have been painstaking work for the
                        abolitionists, digging and reinforcing these passages. But as Old Gin says, great souls have
                        wills, while feeble souls, only wishes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I swing open the trapdoor and haul myself out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The heavy skirts of the Virginia cedar spread all around me, a tree as good at
                        hiding secrets as keeping out snow. Foliage blocks the Bell residence fifty yards to the east,
                        the boardinghouse to the north, and the soda factory to the south. Before exiting the copse of
                        trees, I assure myself that no one is looking. A chill picks up the skin of my arms. I scan the
                        area but see no one.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre21">Suddenly, a crow shoots from the bushes with a hard
                        squawk, pulling my heart out of my throat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sneaky old flapper,” I mutter as my heart settles back into my chest. Nothing
                        better to do than scare respectable girls hiding in trees. I wish it were a bat, a word that
                        sounds like the Chinese word for “luck.” The bats here seem to be waking from their winter
                        slumber later than usual, maybe waiting for the peaches to ripen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bending the rim of my misfit hat to shadow my face, I hoof toward the main
                        business district. Had I a mother, she would no doubt be troubled by the ease at which I travel
                        unaccompanied. Thankfully, growing up, Old Gin allowed me to wear trousers, which were more
                        practical for my work as a stable girl. He also allowed me to learn basic self-defense from
                        Hammer Foot, the other uncle I remembered, who had been raised by Shaolin monks. Shaolin
                        requires many years of unerring devotion to master, but my “Hammer Foot” move almost broke Lucky
                        Yip’s ankle. May I have a lucky strike today, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">B<span class="calibre9">Y THREE O</span>’<span class="calibre9">CLOCK</span>,
                        I’ve made over two dozen inquiries. For my troubles, I net seventeen doors and one window closed
                        on my face; two offers of employment as a “chambermaid” that certainly involved chambers, but
                        not the cleaning of them; one twisted ankle from a crone who sicced her dog on me; and one offer
                        to dye cloth, which was revoked as soon as the mistress saw me limping. I count myself
                        fortunate; Lucky Yip once got a dog sicced on him who tore open his knee. Despite his name, he
                        wasn’t very lucky.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">All the determination I felt earlier bleeds into the sidewalks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A drunken chorus from somewhere ahead diverts my path onto a narrower street I
                        usually avoid on account of the smell. “Carcass Alley” features both a butchery and a mortuary,
                        though I think the real stench blows in from the courthouse down the street, which has never
                        allowed a Chinese to win a single lawsuit. A sagging dwelling with flaking paint seems to cough
                        with every bang of a woman’s hammer as she works to nail a sign into one of its posts. <i

                            class="calibre7">A</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">VAILABLE</i></span>. The
                        iron banisters to the doorway have rusted, and several windows are missing their glass. Who
                        would pay to live in a wreck like that?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I bite my tongue, lest the monkeys of mischief hear my thoughts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How much is the room?” I call up to her. Chinese aren’t actually allowed to
                        own land or rent&mdash;Old Gin and the other bachelors had squatted in a cluster of ramshackle
                        shanties before I was born&mdash;but for the right price, folks could be persuaded to look the
                        other way.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-74" class="calibre21">The woman twists around, and her eyes clinch at the sight
                        of me. “Too much for you. Y’ar kind is likely to trek in nits, plus I bet you smoke black tar.”
                        She ducks into the house and lets the door swing shut behind her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My fingernails have lodged themselves in my palms, and I extract them with a
                        slow breath. I don’t want to live here, anyway. The only worse abode would be Collins Street,
                        and Old Gin would never let us inhabit that crime pit. I hobble away, my steps tight and quick.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before the train crossing, people crowd bright food stalls, thick as bees on
                        honeycomb. When the sidewalk grows too crowded, anyone not white takes to the street. Old Gin
                        always instructed the uncles to give way&mdash;the river travels the fastest path by moving
                        around the stones&mdash;though he never made me walk in the streets.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Leaning against a lamppost, I stretch out my ankle and breathe into it. Hammer
                        Foot said we could move energy through our body through focused breathing. The scent of sausages
                        tempts me into parting with the dime I brought for emergencies. I resist and redirect my nose to
                        a poster on the nearest building, one of the many that has excited a fervor in ladies like Salt
                        and Pepper.</p>

                    <p class="calibre21">It is curious that Mrs. Payne chose to make the race a turnaround event where
                        ladies ask men. I never considered her progressive, even if she did once let a Chinese girl work
                        in her house. The Payne Estate will be busy. Perhaps that is why Old Gin believes there may be
                        extra work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When my ankle stops throbbing, I continue toward the crossing. Next to Union
                        Station, benches are arranged back to back for those awaiting the train. My feet slow when I
                        notice a bundle of white-and-gray fur. It’s a sheepdog, its tail thumping the worn boots of the
                        man on the nearest bench.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Great geese, it’s Nathan Bell.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Keep moving!” barks the crossing guard, gesturing with his flags.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Instead of crossing the tracks&mdash;seven in all&mdash;I duck behind an
                        abandoned dray with a broken wheel and pull my hat low. Nathan has never seen me, of course, and
                        that is how I want to keep it. I marvel at the coincidence of seeing him the day after his
                        mother, though the Chinese believe coincidence is just destiny unfolding.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-75" class="calibre21">I should hurry on. Traffic streams by me while the
                        crossing remains open. But curiosity keeps me rooted. I never allowed myself more than a quick
                        glance through the print shop windows. I think he is silently condemning a cigar butt on the
                        pavement, until a breeze blows the nub away, and Nathan’s gaze remains fixed. In fact, his ear
                        is cocked in the direction of two ladies seated behind him, their hats bent toward each other.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan is . . . eavesdropping? Not only that, but jotting notes in a journal.
                        Now, that is bold. Of course, I do a little eavesdropping myself, but never mind that now.
                        Perhaps he is writing an article. Certainly not one about hickory fungus.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I maneuver to the front of the dray. Nathan’s spindly fingers work his pencil,
                        the dark slashes of his eyebrows crouched low on his face. Hammer Foot, whose own eyebrows were
                        plucked as a boy and never regrew, said folks with crouching eyebrows prefer the comfort of
                        shadows. I always considered Nathan’s face unremarkable. But the more I study it, the more
                        interesting it grows: sturdy chin; deep-set eyes in dove gray that take in more than they give
                        away; and a no-nonsense nose that will do a decent job supporting the spectacles he will need
                        one day with all the fine print he sets. A grouchy Homburg in soil brown holds itself stiffly at
                        the brim despite a droopy crown. You can tell a lot about a person by their choice of headgear.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A bark shocks me from my thoughts. To my horror, Bear’s head swings toward me,
                        though I can’t tell where her eyes are looking, or if the creature even has eyes underneath her
                        mop of a head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Not two shakes later, Bear bounds over to me, woofing and bellowing like she’s
                        discovered the world’s largest sheep. It’s uncanny that an animal with no eyes could have such
                        accurate aim. Why am I so irresistible to the canine species? My ankle cowers, and I wish I had
                        bought that sausage. Hammer Foot always said <i class="calibre7">Do not engage an adversary;
                            feed it</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I dodge one way, then another, but the boot of my injured ankle catches on one
                        of the ties. I fall in a heap right on the tracks. Frantically, I scramble backward,
                        anticipating the teeth that could impale my limb like a drumstick. Something rips! My
                        stockings&mdash;they’re wet. Dear God, am I bleeding?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">No. I am being . . . licked. “Stop! Please,” I beg the sheepdog.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Forbearance! Forbear this instant!” Nathan utters in a voice that could bend
                        grass. The licking stops. I am vaguely aware of him pulling the dog away from me. Traffic carves
                        a path around us with its stamping hooves and squeaking wheels.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What has gotten into you? I am sorry, miss.” Nathan’s eyes fasten onto me, and
                        that familiar confused gaze I provoke in others lands squarely on curious.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-76" class="calibre21">I pull off a glove and feel for my leg, which, thank the
                        Almighty, is still attached. However, my flaxen stockings have torn. Feeling Nathan’s gaze on my
                        exposed limb, I yank my dress back down, and he glances away. Bear, on the other hand, is
                        jumping around as if trying to climb the air, her tongue waving like a pink flag.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before I can gracefully flee, Nathan pants, “Beg your pardon, miss. She usually
                        only gets this excited with people she knows.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I freeze. Bear <i class="calibre7">knows</i> me. She must have smelled me
                        living below her, sure as I recognize the familiar scents of the Bell household on
                        Nathan&mdash;lemon laundry soap and printer’s ink. Thank the Lord the beasts don’t talk, though
                        it is clear they have opinions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The crossing guard points his flag at us. “Move along! Next one’s in two
                        minutes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sheepdog begins circling, as if to herd us off the tracks, and her leash
                        wraps around us, yanking Nathan toward me. Nathan’s mouth tucks into a grimace, showing teeth
                        Robby would approve of, teeth I shouldn’t be admiring from so close. My skin tingles at the
                        energy surrounding him&mdash; warm and vibrant as the tracks, which have started to hum. Before
                        we collide, Nathan releases his end of the leash and grabs the dog by the collar. “Naughty. I
                        should make you into a rug.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pull free of the slackening rein.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Clear the track! She’s coming through!” The guard clangs a bell, and the last
                        of the traffic scurries across. A plume of smoke drags through the sky.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We hurry off the track, but where is my glove? Dropped between the ties, only
                        ten paces away. What good is one glove? I will need to buy another pair, and I was saving up for
                        a new hat to replace my misfit one. I could make it if I hurry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A hand stays me. “Is your skull cracked?” Nathan hisses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shake my arm free of him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A train whistle shoots a hole in the air through which all other sound escapes,
                        even the sound of Bear’s barking. I chug away as fast as my limbs can carry me.</p>

                    <h2>Five</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">I return home a quarter of an hour later than usual,
                            owing to a</span> circuitous route I used in case Nathan tried to follow me. If you had tied
                        a string to my ankle, I would’ve woven an impressive cat’s cradle through the neighborhood. It
                        occurs to me that Bear is already on to me, and therefore, whichever route I took matters
                        little. On the other hand, she has smelled me living in her basement for all these years and
                        never spoke up before. Perhaps to the dog, I’m just another scent that makes up home, and we can
                        all carry on as normal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I attempt to wash the day’s filth off my hands, but our soap slips from my
                        grasp. When I pour the rinse water from the pitcher, some of the precious liquid sloshes over
                        the bucket rim onto the concrete.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin, who goes to the public baths on Tuesday nights, has already set
                        pickled tomatoes and two drumsticks on my chipped plate, covered by a bowl.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I settle onto my bed and remove my ripped stockings. The word <i
                            class="calibre7">gelogenic</i>, which means “invoking laughter,” catches my eye, and under
                        it, <i class="calibre7">gigot</i>, which means “leg of mutton.” My wall is mocking me. So is the
                        listening tube, which beckons me to unplug it. I assure myself that everything is normal. Bear
                        doesn’t know me from a hole in the wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pinch the wool plug from the tube.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear woofs so loudly it seems she is mere inches from my head. I jump back with
                        such force, I tumble off my mattress.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Bear, get down from that wall&mdash;” says Nathan. I stare at the tube in
                        horror, as if the sheepdog might actually jump through the vent and slither out.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-77" class="calibre21">Has the creature scented me? She never did that before in
                        the five years she has lived here. I reach for the plug, but then the scrabble of claws fades.
                        Nathan’s voice comes back into focus. “Who knew there were so many opinions on how to ask a man
                        to a horse race?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear woofs from farther away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My favorite was the chaperone with the chin hairs. ‘You must lodge yourself
                        like a poppy seed in his teeth, and he’ll be dying to take you out,’” Nathan mimics an
                        impressive Irish accent. In his regular voice, he adds, “What do you think, Bear?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">This time, Bear does not woof.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You prefer the lady with the birdcage?” Nathan affects a voice that sounds as
                        if its owner is missing teeth. “‘Horses stink. I’d rather pick aphids off my azaleas.’” He
                        snorts. “I do like how <i class="calibre7">azalea</i> rolls off the tongue. Plus, it gives <i
                            class="calibre7">z</i> a chance to get out of the box. <i class="calibre7">Z</i>s have had a
                        hard time ever since Zach Taylor left office.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I stifle a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, I’m going with the poppy seed. That’s the kind of thing Aunt Edna would
                        say.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">So Nathan was eavesdropping for an advice column. But lodging oneself like a
                        poppy seed? Poppycock. The rules clearly state ladies should ask the men. Why complicate
                        matters? Of course, that’s how courtship works. People never come right out and say what’s on
                        their minds, preferring a complicated dance to simply walking across the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But the Bells need something different from Aunt Edna, something radical, if
                        the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> is to reach two thousand subscribers by April. Why put a
                        second horse in a race when you can put in a dragon, which not only flies but eats horses for
                        breakfast? Atlanta considers itself the capital of the New South, the city that will lead the
                        charge into the twentieth century. Women here, at least white women, are already marching for an
                        amendment that would give them the vote, just like the Fifteenth did for colored men. Surely
                        they are ready for a column that will take on the more serious concerns we face today. Someone
                        needs to blow the trumpets of change. Someone who has viewed society both from the top branch
                        and the bottom, from the inside of the tree and from the outside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Someone like . . . me. If I am such a <i class="calibre7">saucebox</i>, maybe I
                        would make a good agony aunt. I like progress, and I have opinions, just like everyone else. And
                        outside of the Bells, if anyone knows the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>, it’s me. Not only would
                        it help keep them in business, but I would be holding a peach to the bats of good fortune to
                        keep us living here. No one would know my identity. The best way to deliver the truth, if not
                        posthumously, is anonymously.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin would not approve. He required the uncles to follow a long list of
                        rules to minimize the risk of discovery&mdash;no loud talking, no leaving in groups, no dumping
                        of waste into the Bells’ incinerator. But this is for us, too. And he need not find out. Old Gin
                        hardly has time to read the news nowadays.</p>

                    <h2>Six</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">I alight to Old Gin’s side of the house, where a set of
                            drawers holds</span> old fabric and writing supplies. The drawer with the paper fights me,
                        but finally budges. I quickly retrieve a sheet, then steal back to my corner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The ceiling shakes hardest on Wednesday and Saturday nights for the <i
                            class="calibre7">Focus</i>’s biweekly publication on Thursdays and Sundays, but tonight, all
                        is quiet. Instead of switching on my oil lamp, I light a candle, pressing the wax base into a
                        cracked teacup. The light throws my shadow against the concrete walls. I study my darker twin,
                        rolling a pen between her fingers. To whom should I address this letter?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My first thought is Mrs. Bell, but I discard that idea. Her receipt of the
                        mystery letter would come too soon after our encounter at the millinery, one bread crumb away
                        from a trail. That leaves Nathan, who, despite our close encounter, never heard me speak
                        English. It has to be him. Mr. Bell has more than once questioned Nathan’s ability to be
                        publisher. Perhaps I can provide him the chance to show his father some of that forward-thinking
                        spirit for which the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> is known.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan will make a fine publisher one day, maybe not as charismatic as his
                        father, but just as principled. And despite his grouchy disposition, unlike his father, he
                        treads lightly upon the world, as if he knows there is more than one way to make a lasting mark.

                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">again due to the upcoming horse race, even though the
                            sponsors have clearly stated that “ladies may ask gentlemen.”</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre23"><i class="calibre7">I am of the opinion that there are many occasions in
                            which</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">the thing said differs greatly from the thing thought. For
                            example, when one is asked, “Do you like my cucumber pie?” one might respond, “I do indeed,”
                            even though one thinks it looks like alligator spit. If later, the pie eater compliments the
                            fluffiness of said pie, the pie maker might reply, “It is really nothing,” though she be
                            secretly pleased.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">However, the horse race is not one of these occasions.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">Public invitations do not care what you think of them. They

                            your stalling. Your steed may not be available furlong.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="calibre18"><i class="calibre7">Yours sincerely,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shake out my hand, wondering what to name myself. It should be something
                        unique and memorable, a name no one else has. Our horse comes to mind. I had named her Sweet
                        Potato because of her gentle and solid nature. Something with the word <i
                            class="calibre7">sweet</i> would be perfect, to temper the more provocative nature of the
                        articles I would pen. <i class="calibre7">Miss Sweetie</i>, I write with a flourish. Then I
                        cautiously uncork the listening tube. A chair scrapes the floor. Nathan’s shoes tap evenly
                        across to the wall and back again, followed by the scrabble of Bear’s paws. She woofs, but not
                        toward the vent, to my immense relief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The knowledge that the person to whom I am writing is also writing just one
                        floor above makes my shadow sit up straighter, and if shadows had smiles, I might see one
                        reflected there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I seal the paper with the candle wax. My legs bounce, itching to deliver it,
                        but I must wait until tonight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Too fired up to eat, I rummage through the crates Old Gin keeps in his room,
                        hoping to find another pair of gloves. Most of the uncles took their scant belongings with them
                        when they left, but oddments remain, like Lucky Yip’s favorite cushion and Hammer Foot’s
                        two-string fiddle, which for obvious reasons he rarely used.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Not finding gloves, I restack the crates, and my eyes catch on a rolled-up rug
                        standing in the corner. It’s been there so long, it almost looks like part of the wall. We could
                        use a rug like that under the spool table to cushion Old Gin’s creaky ankles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The rug fights me when I drag it from its corner, spitting dust and making me
                        sneeze. I unroll it, and to my surprise, a set of clothes drops out: a navy suit with fine
                        French seams, a four-ply linen collared shirt, a coat of undyed wool, and one barely scratched
                        pair of black-and-white Balmoral boots. No wonder the rug was so heavy.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre21">Whoever wore the clothes was taller than either Hammer
                        Foot or Lucky Yip and slim in build. He certainly dressed finer than the typical laborer. Maybe
                        he was a gambler. If so, Old Gin would never have allowed him to live with us. But he must have
                        been someone important to Old Gin; otherwise, why not sell the clothes?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I am fitting the rug under our spool table when I hear Old Gin’s narrow step
                        approaching. Freshly scrubbed and smelling of cedar, he hangs his coat and cap on a wall hook.
                        He frowns at the mostly blue-speckled rug, then tests the springiness with his toe. “Fits well
                        here, but I see you have been too busy redecorating to eat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I wasn’t hungry until now.” My lowered voice sounds chirpier than normal, and
                        I busy myself working the meat off the drumstick. “Please, I can’t finish both.” I gesture to
                        the second drumstick with my knife.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If you only eat one, you will walk lopsided.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I wait for his face to break, but it doesn’t. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if
                        he’s joking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I found clothes, too, and a pair of Balmorals. Who did they belong to?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He doesn’t turn around from where he’s pouring himself tea at the stove. “One
                        of the uncles. You wouldn’t remember him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, they are fine clothes. The Balmorals alone will fetch ten dollars.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He dries his hands on the towel by the stove, then settles himself on his
                        milking stool. “I will take care of it.” Reaching toward me, he pulls something from my ear: a
                        bluebell, one of the deep violet beauties that grow along the Paynes’ hedges. A grin spreads
                        across his face. “Mrs. Payne will see you tomorrow about a position.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I take the bluebell and twirl it between my fingers. “What position?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He pauses, as if readying the words before sending them out. “Weekday maid. For
                        Caroline.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">Caroline?</i>” The name of the Paynes’ only daughter
                        douses me with cold water.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She returned from finishing school last month.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I grimace. “You knew.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I suspected.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, I don’t know how to be a lady’s maid.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">At my dismissive tone, Old Gin’s uneven ears twitch. He interlaces his fingers
                        and shakes his hands at the wrist, a “good fortune” gesture to keep away the monkeys of
                        mischief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I sigh. The wildflower doesn’t complain when the horse waters it. It is just
                        thankful for the moisture. I should be grateful for Old Gin’s devotion, and willing to do my
                        share. After a day of beating the rug for any paying crumbs that might shake loose, a real job
                        drops in my lap, and I react as if it were a hairy spider. “Forgive me, Father.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-82" class="calibre21">He stretches his ankles, and they make cracking sounds.
                        “Caroline is older now. You are older, too, hm?” Despite his mild tone, he sees right through
                        me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My pickled tomato is so sour, I chase it with water. A long-buried memory of
                        being locked in a rusted bin during hide-and-seek on the Payne Estate bubbles to the surface.
                        When Old Gin finally found me, I had wet myself, and my voice was raw from yelling. Though
                        Caroline was only seven and I was five, and plenty of vile nippers grow into well-mannered
                        adults, I doubt she is one of them. A cockroach will always be a nasty, horrible insect.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I feel Old Gin’s eyes on me and try to unbend my frown. “If I get the job,
                        perhaps I’ll be able to watch the horse race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin’s face is as honest as the sun, but for a fleeting second, a cloud
                        passes over it and then burns away. He is hiding something from me, just as I am hiding
                        something from him. The last time I sensed it was when he told me that Lucky Yip had left for a
                        “better home.” I only later learned that Lucky Yip had taken a one-way trip back to China. In an
                        urn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Standing, Old Gin runs his hands over his belly. He hasn’t touched the
                        drumstick. “No chess tonight. Turn in early.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Okay,” I say, though it isn’t clear whether he is telling me to turn in early
                        or that <i class="calibre7">he</i> needs the rest. “I’ll clean up.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I watch with concern as Old Gin retreats to his quarters, until dark memories
                        of Caroline muscle out any other thoughts in my head. With bucket and brush, I work out my
                        agitation on the dishes, washing them until they squeak. Then I complete my own toilet in the
                        privacy of my corner. The leftover barley water not only disinfects the skin, but keeps my hair
                        shiny. Finally, I tuck my letter to Nathan in my waistband and carry the wastewater plus my
                        small chamber pot to the eastern corridor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Like the tree exit, the eastern “barn” exit originates by our stove, but it
                        terminates in the stall of a half-burned barn with a squashed roof. The barn must have provided
                        a handy terminus for the enslaved on their road to freedom, offering not only a lookout but a
                        water source from a well dug deep underground. I can still smell the charred wood from Sherman’s
                        infamous march to the sea twenty-five years ago. The barn had been burned beyond repair, yet it
                        persisted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I will persist, too. Working as Caroline’s maid makes good economic sense, as
                        Mrs. English would say. I should be so lucky to get a job right after losing one, especially one
                        with the most influential family in Atlanta.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Maybe finishing school will have snipped off a few of Caroline’s more
                        disagreeable threads and stitched a sound hem on her rough edges. I must put my best foot
                        forward.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A cloudless sky has shed its day colors for a robe of dark violet. The scent of
                        sewage, ever present in Atlanta, feels less combative than usual to my nose. Whenever it rains,
                        storm water causes the sewers to overflow into the streets, but thankfully, the weather is
                        finally starting to dry. I make sure no one is looking, and then quickly pour the wastes into
                        the drain by the side of the road.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre21">Leaving the pot and bucket in the barn, I slip around to
                        the Bells’ house. A group of men, out for a night of drinking, judging by their boisterous
                        voices, eye me from across the street. One wolf-whistles, starting off a chain of hoots through
                        the pack. A jag of fear streaks through me. I make a show of walking up to the Bells’ porch,
                        hoping the men will pass by when they see I have a destination.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The whistling stops and the men move on. Praying the banging of my heart
                        doesn’t give me away, I slide my letter into the Bells’ mail drop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My plans are laid.</p>

                    <h2>Seven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Old Gin and I sail up Peachtree Street in Seamus
                            Sullivan’s ten-row</span> streetcar, the plodding rhythm of the mule out of sync with the
                        trotting of my heart. Most of the commuters, both black and white, cluster around the coal
                        heater Sully keeps in front. I suggested we sit up front today, though Old Gin refused. It is
                        understood that the warmer rows are reserved for the weakest passengers, which Old Gin insists
                        is not him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">While he exchanges pleasantries with a nanny, Mrs. Washington, I pick at my
                        fraying sleeves and poke my finger through a hole in the seam. I wish I had thought to try on my
                        old maid’s uniform last night, when I could’ve made adjustments.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Lucy’s having a ‘first day,’ too&mdash;at Spelman Seminary. She’s a lucky
                        girl,” Mrs. Washington says to Old Gin in her slow, lilting voice. All her freckles brighten on
                        her face, which is charmingly set off by a bright yellow bonnet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A twinge of longing stirs my soul. Only a few years old, Spelman has already
                        established a reputation as a fine school for colored girls. Old Gin has schooled me in
                        mathematics, Chinese, and philosophy since I was five. English and history were more challenging
                        for him, but the Bells’ misprint newspapers and conversations stepped in there. When I was
                        twelve, he tried to enroll me at the Girls’ High School, but we were told I would have to attend
                        the colored school. Old Gin said I shouldn’t take a colored child’s seat, given how few seats
                        they had.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He glances at me sitting tight as a new shoe beside him. “I believe Luck rides
                        a workhorse named Joy.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre21">“Luck rides a workhorse named Joy,” Mrs. Washington
                        repeats, and she throws back her head. “Ha! That’s a good one. She <i class="calibre7">does</i>
                        work hard, and she does enjoy it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">One of the colored children rings the bell up front with a <i
                            class="calibre7">ka-klank! ka-klank!</i> The kids are always vying for that privilege. The
                        streetcar stops.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Votes for women!” chants a group from behind us. Heads turn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A pair of safety bicycles float by, leading a trail of white women wearing
                        sashes of marigold fabric. The women range in age, their faces tight with determination as they
                        chant. A few push baby buggies, and one bangs on a drum to mark the beats.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The matron in front of us mutters to her daughters, “Ain’t they got nothing
                        better to do than act like men?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">One of her daughters tugs at her honey-blond braids. “Can we get one of those
                        safeties, Mama? They look like such fun.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Unlike the high-wheeled variety, the chain-driven safeties feature even tires
                        and brakes, so you don’t have to jump off to stop. That means women could ride them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The matron snorts. “Only girls with loose morals ride those. Don’t ever let me
                        catch you on one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sully transports us past a trim colonial, which looks downright shabby compared
                        to the Greek-looking temple one block up. Peachtree Street is Atlanta’s top branch, a stretch so
                        dense with millionaires, you can probably throw a rock and hit three on the way down. A few
                        years back, they carved a special ward out of two neighboring pie slices to separate this
                        wealthy corridor from the rest of northern Atlanta. Not all parts of the pie taste the same.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Ka-klank! ka-klank!</i> The streetcar reaches our stop, a
                        block short of the Payne Estate, and Sully brakes the mule. “Off with you, on with you!” he
                        barks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin casually sweeps a foot underneath an empty bench. The man drives
                        through life with one eye on the road and the other on the lookout for fallen coins. Then he
                        offers me his arm, which feels birdlike under his worn coat. Though we stand the same height,
                        today I feel taller than him. The points of his shoulders seem especially sharp, and even his
                        rib cage projects more than usual under his shirt. He is becoming a bag of bones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">As we walk, my gray skirt swings an inch too high over my boots, and my sleeves
                        slowly strangle my armpits. If I need to beat a hasty retreat, it will not be by swinging on
                        trees.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sight of the crab apple trees that stud the front lawn of the Payne Estate
                        stirs a strange brew of emotions inside me. Looking back, my days working in the stables were
                        mostly carefree, except when Caroline came around, and even then, not all the memories were
                        sour. We played together on occasion&mdash;she was the mama, and I, the naughty babe; she
                        captained the ship, while I manned the oars and, too often, walked the plank. But as we grew
                        older, her bossiness crystallized into something sharper, and her pranks would rattle me for
                        days.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-85" class="calibre21">My life improved when I was twelve and Caroline was sent
                        to the finishing school in Boston. Mrs. Payne decided I was getting too old to swab stables and
                        put me to work as a housemaid. The winds of change blew a year later when Caroline’s brother,
                        Merritt, returned home from Exeter Academy. Abruptly, I was dismissed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A paved driveway marked with electric lampposts, fancier than the ones on
                        Whitehall Street, leads to the front door. We take a second carriage track to a back courtyard,
                        which houses a white gazebo with red shingles to match the rest of the house. Inside the gazebo,
                        a safety bicycle leans against a post. It looks new, with its pneumatic tires, a polished metal
                        frame, and a red leather seat. Sure, it’s a looker, but a pretty horse does not a fair ride
                        make.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My heels drag as I follow Old Gin to the scullery door. He raps on the wood,
                        and not two shakes later, the housekeeper and head of staff, Etta Rae, is grinning her triangle
                        smile at me and clapping me on the back with her wiry arms. The only signs of her age are a few
                        liver spots on her sable skin and the graying of her hair at the temples. “You’re growing like a
                        rumor, aren’t you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s good to see you, Etta Rae.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She hauls me past the onion-scented scullery and into the kitchen, never one to
                        waste movements. Old Gin doffs his hat and follows. He rarely enters the kitchen, and never the
                        rest of the house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Watch the shells. Noemi broke her nutcracker and she’s had to use a hammer.
                        Makes an awful mess.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The kitchen hasn’t changed much. Copper pans and pots hang in neat rows on the
                        wall between a sink on one side and an iron range, where Noemi is stirring oatmeal, on the
                        other. “Good morning, Noemi.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She knocks her spoon against the pot rim. The speckled blue enamel finish
                        contrasts sharply with the cast-iron pots meant for the servants. “Morning, yourself,” she
                        speaks in a drawl pleasing to the ear, dropping <i class="calibre7">r</i>’s and <i
                            class="calibre7">g</i>’s along the way. Those letters don’t have much business here in the
                        South for colored and white alike, as worthless as the pecan shells strewn on the floor. A smile
                        animates her handsome features&mdash;pointy cheekbones, tawny skin, and bushy eyebrows that hail
                        from her Portuguese ancestry. Smelling like soap, she kisses me on the cheek. “I’m glad to see
                        you, but”&mdash; her voice drops&mdash;“you sure you want to wrestle a porcupine?” A mischievous
                        coil of springy black hair peeks out from beneath the ruffle of her mobcap, and she pokes it
                        back in place.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Gin, you’ve been skipping too many meals!” Etta Rae knocks Old Gin with her
                        elbow.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre21">Old Gin puts up a hand. “Old men don’t need much&mdash;”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Take these pecans.” With her knobby fingers, Etta Rae scoops a handful of nuts
                        from the piles that cover the farm table where I’ve taken many meals. “They’re like little blobs
                        of fat. You could use a whole tree of ’em.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin is too polite not to take the pecans, even though pecans make his mouth
                        itch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The scent of peaches nudges up my pulse. Mrs. Payne appears at the center of a
                        molded doorframe that leads to the dining room, twisting her gold wedding band. It’s a bottom
                        fact that if Mrs. Payne had accepted all the proposals of marriage she received, she would have
                        more rings than fingers. “Well, then.” Her eyes dribble over me. If she bears me ill will, there
                        is no trace of it on her face. I wonder if she sees any on mine. I was the one dismissed for no
                        reason, after all. “Old Gin, I’m much obliged to you for bringing Jo home to us.” Her manners
                        have always been flawless, but if you put a hand to her forehead, I expect she runs cooler than
                        most.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You’re welcome.” He bows, then after throwing me a quick smile, leaves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I curtsy. “Ma’am, I am pleased to see you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne glides to me. She stands just a breeze under my height, but I feel
                        like a dandelion in the presence of a rose. By itself, her face is not striking&mdash;watery
                        blue eyes and a drawn-out nose that dips toward her too-dainty mouth&mdash;but an elegant neck
                        and narrow carriage give her the presence of a queen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I roll back my shoulders, two bumps that give the illusion of good posture even
                        when I slump. Shoulders are like pavement, underappreciated for the job they do holding one up
                        in the world. Mine have done a decent job.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Still pretty as a June pay-itch,” she says, drawling the word <i
                            class="calibre7">peach</i>. Like other ladies of her class, she has a habit of leaning into
                        her words as if to squeeze out all their juice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She whisks me farther into the house. “You remember where everything is?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The Payne house typifies those of the Southern gentry, with family needs
                        subjugated by the need to entertain, something Southerners consider their God-given duty. In the
                        dining room, black walnut chairs herald from Italy, but they are as difficult to separate from
                        the table as heifers from a trough. The gold-flocked wallpaper attracts dust like a magnet pulls
                        iron. My arms ache just looking at the chandelier, which needs to be taken apart weekly for its
                        routine spit and polish.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">From the dining room, we pass into a central hall, to a staircase leading to
                        the private floors. Mrs. Payne lifts her pleated skirts and begins to ascend, hardly making a
                        sound. The daughter of horse breeders, Mrs. Payne was groomed in the Southern tradition of
                        manners and manors, and probably gave up slouching the year she stopped sucking her thumb. “Now,
                        Jo, what is it that separates us from the animals?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre21">“We know how to open the pickle jar?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She smiles. “<i class="calibre7">Religion</i>, child. Chapel is still nine a.m.
                        on Sunday. You are always welcome.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you, ma’am.” The Paynes invite all the staff to attend Sunday services
                        in their private chapel. When you’re as rich as the Paynes, God comes to you. But after the
                        chaplain told me Satan had already hooked one claw into me for being born a heathen and I would
                        have to pray extra hard if I wanted to escape his grasp, I never enjoyed going to the Paynes’
                        services.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Photographs of Caroline and Merritt through the years line the walls. As a
                        child, Merritt wore frocks, and the two looked like sisters with their soft curls and cherubic
                        gazes. The higher one ascends, the more devilish their gazes become.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Merritt’s in Virginia picking up a new horse,” Mrs. Payne continues the
                        pleasantries. “He’s engaged, did you hear?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You and Mr. Payne must be very pleased.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It is an exceptional arrangement,” she states brightly, though to my thinking,
                        the same could be said of furniture.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt had been standing on this very staircase, a few steps below me, when
                        his mother dismissed me. Only seventeen then, he’d been wearing a ridiculously billowy shirt
                        that spilled out over his tight breeches, as was the style. The air had been so wet, you could
                        drink from it, and I’d rolled my sleeves up as far as they would go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My legs wobble, and I grip the rail. Was Merritt the reason I was dismissed?
                        Now that he is engaged, it is safe to bring me back. But I had always known my place.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hurry to catch up with Mrs. Payne. On the third and highest floor, where the
                        women’s chambers are located, the scent of the mahogany wood paneling swills acid in my stomach.
                        It’s curious how even the faintest smells can inflict injuries. I recall the time Caroline
                        accused me of losing her brooch. I searched on my hands and knees for an hour, before she showed
                        me the brooch on her hat. “I wanted to see how long it took you to notice,” she said with a
                        laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline pops her head out of her bedroom, her weasel-brown hair scattered
                        around buttermilk cheeks. The rest of her follows, draped in a gauzy gown. Her body has
                        blossomed&mdash;round arms, ample chest, and hips that could stir up hearts and trouble alike. I
                        could never have a body like Caroline’s, no matter how many pecans I ate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline drags her frost-blue eyes down me, eyes that look like they’ve been
                        pressed too hard into her face. “Your hairstyle is barbaric, take it out. Maids should not try
                        to outshine their mistresses.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre21">Charming as ever. It’d taken me a good part of the morning
                        to plait my locks into a side braid I call “waterfall over rocky ledge.” The banister tempts me
                        to hop on and slide away while I still have a chance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Now, make yourself useful and bring up a tray. Something robust, as I will be
                        going for a ride this afternoon.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Caroline,” Mrs. Payne interjects, “we have not come to an agreement yet.
                        Please finish sorting through your belongings for castoffs. The Society for the Betterment of
                        Women is sending their wagon tomorrow.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The tip of Caroline’s nose draws a checkmark in the air. “I’ve already sorted
                        my things.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What about the safety?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Bicycles are so vulgar. I don’t know why you bought it in the first place.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Bicycles are quite current. Of course, nothing will ever replace our horses in
                        speed or beauty, but a ‘freedom machine’ will exercise different parts of you that could use
                        exercising.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s sharp nostrils flatten, and she makes a vulgar noise at the back of
                        her throat. Snatching her dressing gown around her, she evaporates into her bedroom, the fabric
                        swirling like smoke around her ankles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne’s movements are jerky as she leads me to a guest bedroom. Her
                        normally controlled expression has come loose, as if her daughter had agitated the water. She
                        closes the door behind us and lets out a controlled breath. “Now, Jo, I do not doubt your
                        ability to handle this job. What concerns me is, well, you and Caroline grew up together here.
                        But you are not equals. You understand that, do you not?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Certainly, ma’am,” I say, though the words sting like vinegar on a sunburn. “I
                        hope I have never, er, acted above my station?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, you have not. But now that you are both young ladies, I want to be clear
                        on where we all stand.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am.” I’ve understood that ever since I <i class="calibre7">could</i>
                        stand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A sigh pulls her shoulders down. “Wonderful. You will work Monday through
                        Friday, with payment on Fridays, five dollars each week. I trust that is acceptable?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It’s much more than Mrs. English paid and includes meals. The Paynes take pride
                        in how well they treat their domestics. Yet, I still prefer my old job, with its promise of a
                        future. “Yes, ma’am. Thank you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She pulls from a wardrobe a black uniform of thick cotton, and cream-colored
                        stockings. “As before, leave your uniform in the laundry basket for our washerwoman to collect
                        at the end of the week. Your duties are to maintain Caroline’s quarters, her wardrobe, and her
                        person, and to accompany her when she goes out. You may use one of my old riding habits.
                        Caroline’s might be too big for you.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre21">Back into the wardrobe she goes, selecting a velvet jacket
                        and matching skirt. A pair of jersey pants with quilted knees hangs next to the other riding
                        clothes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noticing my interest, she peers back into the closet. “Is there something there
                        that interests you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I just noticed, er, the riding breeches.” As girls, Caroline and I rode horses
                        astride&mdash;she in knee-length dresses, and I in boy’s overalls&mdash;but now that we are
                        older, we are expected to use the sidesaddle. At least, fine ladies are.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, I thought I had given them away.” She brings them out and smooths the
                        fabric under her slender fingers. “I used to show horses on my parents’ farm.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin told me the “farm” spanned more than a hundred acres and produced some
                        of the finest horses in the South. Horses seem to be the only thing that cause her eyes to
                        light, though she had to give up riding them after an injury.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Would you like to use them?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, I couldn’t.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Things are meant to be used.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you, ma’am. I ride better in the cross saddle.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As do I. Being packed and twisted into an unnatural side seat is hard on the
                        spine. I swear it’s the reason for my bad back, despite what the doctor says. And I daresay it
                        would make keeping up with Caroline easier.” Her smooth brow furrows, as if mentioning her
                        daughter’s name set off a flurry of thoughts underneath. She digs out a smile. “Of course, they
                        might mistake you for a suffragist.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, they won’t make that mistake,” I return brightly. “You have to be a
                        citizen before you can be a suffragist.” Without birth records, Old Gin and I couldn’t prove to
                        City Hall that I was born here. He suggested there might be an exception for foundlings, but the
                        clerk wheezed in my face, “Not fer you, there ain’t.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne’s smile flattens and the beadlike protrusion in the center of her
                        upper lip&mdash;same as mine&mdash;disappears. Chinese believe a “pearl” lip attracts good
                        fortune. “Well, be that as it may, women have more important worries than the vote. Like raising
                        up our children. Surely you don’t disagree?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, ma’am,” I demure. If I were truly a saucebox, I would point out that many
                        women are unable to raise their children when factories such as the ones owned by her husband
                        make them early widows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She snorts. “Those suffragists want equality, but I gave up such romantic
                        notions long ago. One must be careful about what one wishes. Better to be satisfied with one’s
                        lot, as there is always someone who is worse off.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre21">Make that a whole lot of someones, in her case. I lower my
                        eyes. “Yes, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I do not want Caroline to go visiting alone.” Mrs. Payne’s tone crisps. “If I
                        find you have disobeyed me, you will be dismissed. Do I make myself clear?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She breezes away. Quickly, I undo my waterfall braid and finish dressing. But
                        even after every button is fastened and every stray hair is tucked under a mobcap identical to
                        Noemi’s, I still feel exposed. Caroline is like spring weather; you know to carry an umbrella in
                        case a cloudbuster comes along. But Mrs. Payne is winter most days of the year. It was rumored
                        that, when Caroline was still a toddler, Mrs. Payne fell into a year-long melancholic spell
                        during which she lived with her parents in Savannah. There is no understanding her, only the
                        reminder that one should not get too comfortable in her presence, for things can change very
                        quickly.</p>

                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Noemi takes in my crisp uniform and nods. “Welcome back.
                            Let the</span> fun begin.” She hands me a broom. While she glides around the kitchen
                        assembling Caroline’s tray, I sweep up pecan shells.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mr. Merritt wants pecan pie for his engagement party.” Her cast-iron eyes
                        glare at a wall hook. “Folks who love pecan pie ain’t usually the ones making it. Barely
                        finished half, and look.” She shows me a constellation of blisters along her palm.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-91" class="calibre21">“Mind if I take a crack?” I set down the broom, then take
                        the hammer and begin splitting nuts. The first bang nearly cracks open my thumb. The second
                        leaves a dent in the table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi bends an eyebrow my direction. “Good. By the time you’re done, we might
                        not have pecan pie, but we will have firewood.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I say a silent word of appreciation for Noemi, who had made Caroline’s cruelty
                        easier to bear growing up here because she knew firsthand how it felt. Her mother had been
                        Caroline’s mammy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae pokes her head in the kitchen. A breeze couldn’t enter the house
                        without her knowing it. “Work don’t get done on giggles. Noemi, if Solomon comes by, tell him to
                        move the bicycle to the work shed by the crates with the castoffs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi’s eyes become thoughtful. “Yes, ma’am.” She hands me a tray of steaming
                        oatmeal, a pitcher of cream, a bowl of brown sugar so fine it glitters, and a pot of coffee.
                        “Better git before the porcupine starts throwing quills.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Climbing the stairs, I manage to keep most of the coffee in the pot, though the
                        tray is as awkward to carry as a live pig. “Miss?” I call through Caroline’s door. Keeping an
                        iron grip on the tray, I let myself into the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline sits at a mirrored dressing table. The formerly pastel room has been
                        updated with wallpaper featuring peacock feathers, which stare like a hundred eyeballs.
                        Turquoise swags cascade into indulgent puddles on the floor. A potted African violet with a
                        single bud stands its ground among all the eyes. Don’t I know how it feels.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I set the tray on a table by the window.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Through her mirror, Caroline casts me a look severe enough to crack the glass.
                        “Oatmeal is hardly robust. Eggs are robust. Bacon is robust. You’ve wasted my time. Still slow
                        as ever, I see.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I grit my teeth and remind myself it is just a job. One that pays money that I
                        wouldn’t have otherwise, money that will become critical if the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>
                        folds. Refusing to acknowledge her mocking expression in the mirror, I heft the tray and carry
                        it back to the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Make sure you bring those eggs sunny-side. I only eat eggs sunny-side.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Perhaps that is because she doesn’t have one of her own. “Certainly, miss.” I
                        duck out of the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nearly drop the tray on the old farm table. Noemi barely glances up from her
                        spot at the sink where she is washing out the oatmeal pot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Miss Caroline would prefer bacon and eggs, sunny-side,” I pant, taking over
                        the washing of the pot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi shakes her head slowly, as if she isn’t surprised in the least. She sets
                        a frying pan on the stove and soon the smell of frying grease is making my stomach grumble.
                        Something out the window catches her eye. “Ever ride a bicycle?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-92" class="calibre21">“No.” I hang the pot on the wall and edge next to her.
                        Outside, Mr. Payne’s butler, Solomon, wheels the bicycle down the carriage track. “I’m not ready
                        to break my legs just yet.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You know how to ride a horse. A bicycle must be easier than that. It’s closer
                        to the ground, and you don’t have to train it. See, I get these ideas, and they keep wheeling
                        around in my head. A bicycle means no waiting for streetcars, sometimes packed so tight you
                        can’t even breathe. Plus, I could visit my no-account brother in the blights without being pawed
                        at.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi rarely talks about her brother, whom, according to Robby, she’s taken to
                        visiting every week to thump Bible-sense into his low and disease-ridden mind. But I don’t see
                        that many women riding bicycles, let alone colored women. I heft the tray, now arranged with two
                        perfectly cooked sunny-side eggs nestled against four rectangles of bacon, and a fresh pot of
                        coffee. “A bicycle must cost a fair penny. You think Mrs. Payne would let you have Caroline’s
                        castoff? She is planning to give it away.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi adds a tiny saltshaker to the tray, but not the pepper&mdash;Caroline is
                        allergic to pepper. Instead of answering me, she pushes me out of her kitchen. “Go before she
                        changes her mind again.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">“A<span class="calibre9">RRANGE MY HAIR </span>into a Newport knot,” orders
                        Caroline, still in her dressing gown. “Be quick about it. I am late for my ride, no thanks to
                        you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, miss.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">While I clean her scalp with a rice-root brush, she smooths cream from a tin of
                        Beetham’s Glycerine and Cucumber onto her face. Her skin favors her father’s, thick and ruddy,
                        not the moonlight-clear complexion of her mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her eyes catch mine, and a scowl colors her face. <i class="calibre7">The
                            mirror makes a fickle friend, my lady.</i> Besides which, as Hammer Foot always said, it is
                        better to look out a window than into a looking glass; otherwise all you see is yourself and
                        what’s behind you.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Don’t touch this. It’s very expensive.” The label on the tin promises to rid
                        the skin of freckles, rendering it “soft, smooth, and white.” But Caroline’s freckles are still
                        loud as exclamation points.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, miss.” I coil her heavy hair at the crown, and shape her curls about her
                        forehead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Noemi has the manners of a cow, but she makes passable eggs, not as good as
                        her mama, of course, but who <i class="calibre7">can</i> measure up to one’s <i
                            class="calibre7">dear</i> mother? You’re lucky you don’t have one.” Her blue eyes goad me in
                        the reflection of her gilded dressing mirror.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It’s impressive how deftly she manages to slap three faces&mdash;her mother’s,
                        Noemi’s, and mine&mdash;with one glove. But I steel my ears against her petty remarks. She’s
                        been singing that tune about my lack of a mother just as long as she’s been pushing Noemi off <i
                            class="calibre7">her</i> mama’s lap. Mrs. Payne’s reminder that Caroline and I are not
                        equals almost makes me laugh. As if Caroline would ever let me forget.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre21">She flings commands like stones. “Powder my neck.” “Fetch
                        my fan&mdash;no, not that one, you cow, can’t you see it’s broken?” “Button these boots.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Is this to be my life, then? One tedious chore after the next, with
                        intermittent pokes in the eye? Unlike with making hats, there is nothing to show for my work,
                        nothing to be proud of, and certainly no gratitude. I despise it and I haven’t even made it past
                        the first day.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hold her boots while she pours in her ghostly white legs. The boots are
                        fashioned from leather so dark they are almost black, with teardrop-shaped cutouts along the top
                        and the polished sheen of a violin. I bet they were purchased in Italy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When we emerge from the grand entrance of the Payne Estate, her in an elegant
                        navy riding habit, me in Mrs. Payne’s riding breeches, not even the sun, bright as a new penny,
                        can cheer me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin is feeding Caroline’s horse, Frederick, pecans, while Sweet Potato
                        tries to lick the cap off his head. The mare has grown at least two hands since I worked here
                        last, and the white jag on her forehead has blossomed into a starburst. Her coat, once fuzzy
                        with a nap that ran in every direction, lies smooth as spilled ink over her well-shaped
                        hindquarters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I scratch the star on Sweet Potato’s forehead. “Aren’t you the prettiest belle
                        on Peachtree Street? Robby would approve of those teeth. Old Gin, give me a few of those nuts.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin shakes his head. “No nuts for Sweet Potato. We are on a diet, hm?” He
                        pats her neck.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Diet? She’s shipshape.” I stroke her left front leg, which still bears the
                        crook that made her limp as a foal, but it feels strong and pliant. Old Gin’s massage and
                        exercises have worked magic.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Once Old Gin helps Caroline into the saddle, Frederick immediately begins to
                        jitter and snort. Old Gin says that to understand your horse is to understand yourself. You
                        cannot get a horse to mind if your own mind is in turmoil, which might explain why Frederick is
                        trying to fling Caroline off like a hot coal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Frederick finally settles, and Caroline presses a hand to her nose. “I feel my
                        allergies acting up.” She has always been reactive in both mind and body.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin hands Caroline the reins. “At least not too windy today, so hat stays
                        on.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, we wouldn’t want Jo to lose that charming scrap of roofing.” Caroline
                        smirks at my misfit hat. Her gaze drops to her mother’s outfit, which fits me like a glove under
                        a velvet jacket with a nipped-in waist. Quickly, she turns away, but not before I catch her
                        blotchy cheeks puffed out in a scowl.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre21">I swing a leg over my own mount, excitement blooming
                        inside me for the first time today. I haven’t been topside of a horse in months. Old Gin’s
                        cowboy saddle, bought for a dollar, fits me like water cupped in a palm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Giddap!” Caroline calls with a flick of her reins, before my foot has even
                        found the stirrup.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Remembering her mother’s caution, I tap my heels, and Sweet Potato sets off. I
                        catch my breath at the lithe athlete she has become, with no hint of a falter remaining in her
                        step. The world is a ball for her alone to kick and bounce along under the afternoon’s cool
                        gaze, and we quickly catch up with Caroline traveling north up Peachtree.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My lady’s too-erect carriage and lifted chin speak volumes about her regard for
                        who’s riding behind her, but I’d take her back to her front any day of the week. At least the
                        back doesn’t have a mouth. Caroline doles out nods and greetings to those she deems worthy,
                        including a woman large with child.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline sneezes and then, with two fingers, tugs an embroidered handkerchief
                        from her glove. I bring Sweet Potato alongside her. “Miss, would you like to rest?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She waves a dismissive hand. “Mrs. Nettles looks like she swallowed a planet.
                        If men truly are the stronger species, why aren’t they the ones having the babies?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Because it would require them to knit, I suppose.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ha!” Moving ahead again, she leaves me to marvel at the miracle of our
                        exchanging words without injury. We pass under the shade of the magnolias and red oaks that
                        sprout everywhere in Atlanta. Trees easily outnumber residents. If you could bottle up the shade
                        and sell it for a nickel, Atlanta would be richer than even New York.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Finally, we stop at a watering trough in an empty lot just before Our Lord’s
                        Chapel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, pshaw.” Caroline twists around on the saddle, casing the ground, while her
                        horse dips his nose.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Is everything okay, miss?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Seems I lost my handkerchief. It can’t be far. Find it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato is lapping thirstily, and so I set off on foot, trying to remember
                        the last time she used her handkerchief. It was at least a block ago. She let out a honk that
                        caused Sweet Potato’s ears to twitch. Leaves, cigar butts, miscellaneous wrappers, horse patties
                        . . . aha! I spot it, looking like a crumpled bird in the street fifty feet away. I hurry to
                        collect it before something stomps it, and then hoof back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato stands alone, shaking her face in the water and making a mess. It
                        takes me a moment to recover my wits. Caroline has tricked me. The only thing left of her is the
                        oily scent of her deception. Her mother warned me about this, yet I settled into her lie as
                        easily as into a porch swing. I was even fooled into imagining a moment between us. I remount,
                        cursing this job once again.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre21">Beyond the chapel, the mansions along Peachtree thin, and
                        the trees grow denser. I turn down the closest cross street, keeping an eye out for her blond
                        gelding. On my right, an expanse of tall grass leads to Six Paces Meadow. I doubt she would’ve
                        gone there&mdash;too much pollen for her allergies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After another fifteen minutes of jogging up and down Peachtree and seeing no
                        sign of Caroline or her horse, we re-tread to the watering trough. Somehow, the snake has
                        slithered into a bush. The chapel clock chimes, indicating half past one. Beyond the chapel lies
                        Our Lord’s Cemetery, shaded and uninviting.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The cemetery.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The dead don’t tell secrets.” I steer Sweet Potato in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We never set foot in Our Lord’s Cemetery, but not because of the ghosts. Many
                        years ago, a Chinese man with “rabid eyes” was rumored to have violated a white woman here. When
                        the caretaker’s wife came upon the appalling scene with a shotgun, the Chinese man ran off, and
                        Chinese men everywhere tried their best not to look rabid.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Beyond the paved driveway to the chapel, hoofprints mark the ground, freshly
                        turned dirt the color of a mourner’s suit. I pat Sweet Potato’s neck. “Guess that wasn’t so
                        hard.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The few headstones are haphazardly planted among ferns, as if the dead were
                        buried where they happened to drop. Dogwood blossoms spot the mossy carpet with an eerie kind of
                        snow, and the air feels cool and wet. Statues of grimacing martyrs and saints with gnarled hands
                        put a hurry in my step. Forget last rest; this is the kind of place that might keep you awake
                        forever.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">No wonder Caroline’s previous maids did not last.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The ground becomes drier, and the hoofprints become harder to pick out. But
                        soon, a single vault of white stone carved with the name <i class="calibre7">I</i><span
                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">NNOCENTI</i></span> appears on our right. Two angels
                        guard either side of the structure, which is shaded all around by a dense grove of trees. In the
                        grove, Frederick is tied to a stout trunk, and beside him stands a tall piebald with unusual
                        coloring, white with a black mane.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I have seen that horse before. Its name is Thief, and it belongs to Mr.
                        Quackenbach, Miss Saltworth’s beau. Poor Salt. Has he spurned her? Or is he just playing a
                        little petticoat peekaboo?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A voice sounds from inside the vault, followed by Caroline’s distinct snort and
                        high giggle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My nose wrinkles. I bet the occupants of that particular tomb wish they could
                        move house. The guardian angels stare lifelessly ahead, daydreaming on the job.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre21">I tuck the information into a pocket of my mind. Then
                        quietly, I back Sweet Potato away, leaving the sinners to their folly.</p>

                    <h2>Nine</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">I catch Caroline coming out of the cemetery, a dreamy
                            smile strung</span> on her lips. Even the sight of me, primly waiting in a stone courtyard
                        at the front of the chapel, doesn’t dampen her mood. Mr. Q is nowhere in evidence. “Hullo,
                        maid.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I trust your afternoon was refreshing, miss.” If not debauching.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She slits her eyes at me. We ride in silence save the jingling of the
                        harnesses. Only when we reach the water trough does she finally toss out, “I like to take my
                        rides by myself. If you want to keep your job, you won’t tell my mother. Just think, you’ll have
                        an hour all to yourself to do whatever you want&mdash;paid, too. Surely you know a good melon
                        when you thunk it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I consider my options. The idea of taking daily larks on Sweet Potato is
                        enticing, though I know it is wicked. Fly with the crows, get shot with the crows, as they say.
                        Of course, Mrs. Payne will fire me if she ever finds out. But if I do tell her, Caroline will
                        certainly find new ways to make my life a misery.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It’s time to catch the snake under my boot, before her bite proves fatal. “The
                        way I see it, the cemetery is where one goes to abandon their mortality, not their . . .
                        morality.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her mingy eyes clench like two fists. “You dirty sneak.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Despite my confident act, my heart squeezes with the thought of my boldness. “I
                        think Miss Saltworth would be very interested in learning who else has been seasoning her
                        roast.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She gasps. Even her back molars blanch. “You know Melly-Lee&mdash;? You
                        wouldn’t.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre21">“What I want is fairness. I was hired to be a lady’s maid,
                        not to suffer your tricks and meanness. Treat me fairly, and you can keep your activities to
                        yourself. Also, I will be wearing my hair however I wish. Agreed?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Crossing her arms over her chest, she glares down at the leaves floating in the
                        trough, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the water started to boil. Frederick whickers and bows
                        his head for another drink. Caroline glances in the direction of Our Lord’s Cemetery, and when
                        her eyes return to me, they are laced with malice, but resigned. “Agreed.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="calibre21">My tongue nearly falls out of my mouth. It’s Billy Riggs, the fixer, trader of
                        dirty secrets. He’s even wearing the same hat he wore for his picture in the <i
                            class="calibre7">Constitution</i>, a demi-top with a stingy brim, burgundy to match his
                        suit. Dark auburn curls conspire like weasels in the den of his neck. While his sorrel drifts on
                        the sidewalk, he works a pocketknife over the tree’s thick bark with quick slashes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato whinnies to Old Gin, and the men, standing a hundred feet away,
                        look up at us. Billy stops carving, and his foxlike face sharpens, becoming almost gleeful. His
                        eyes take their time tramping around on my face. “Well, who do we have here?” His words float
                        toward me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Something in Old Gin’s wary expression warns me away, and I make tracks toward
                        the stables.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Acting disinterested, I tie the horses to a hitching post for Old Gin to untack
                        later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Then I duck into the work shed and double back to the rear, where Caroline’s
                        safety keeps company with a pile of crates containing an assortment of objects, from cracked
                        dishes to hats. Must be the Paynes’ castoffs. Peering through a crack in the wood slats, I can
                        make out Old Gin and Billy still talking. Billy points his knife at Old Gin, and my breath comes
                        out as a hiss. Old Gin does not react.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With a flick of his wrist, the man folds the knife and tucks it up his sleeve.
                        Then he swings a leg over his sorrel and urges her away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">What would the fixer want with Old Gin? My stand-in father clearly wanted to
                        distance himself from me, though I doubt his ruse succeeded. Anyone familiar with Atlanta would
                        know that two Chinese people in the same place at the same time is more than a coincidence. I
                        shake out the stiffness in my limbs and try to make my breathing effortless again, the way
                        Hammer Foot instructed to get energy flowing.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre21">No doubt there is an explanation. I will simply ask Old
                        Gin later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">That decided, I edge around Caroline’s bicycle, and my eyes catch on a hat in
                        the crate of castoffs, a top-shelf camel bonnet with box pleats and a thick tie of rose silk.
                        With its good bones, it must have cost at least eight dollars new, though Mrs. English would’ve
                        charged eight fifty. Perhaps Mrs. Payne will sell it to me for a discount.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">At quitting time, I bring the camel bonnet to Mrs. Payne’s study, where she
                        often writes in her Lady’s Planner. This room used to be my favorite because of the fairy-tale
                        books she kept on the shelf. Then Caroline locked a litter of kittens inside, who tore through
                        the place like termites in a bag of sawdust, and blamed me for the prank. The books were ruined.
                        When Mrs. Payne believed me over her daughter, Caroline hissed in my ear, “I despise you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne looks up from her journal and blinks at the hat in my hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I would like to buy this, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A minnow of curiosity darts across her face. “Go ahead, try it on.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I remove my lace cap and fit the bonnet over my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She rounds her desk and ties the rose ribbon to one side of my chin, as is the
                        fashion, and then sweeps my simple hair braid to the front. “Please accept it as a gift.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Wh-what? Oh no, I couldn’t. I was thinking you could set it aside for me until
                        I could pay for it&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I just lent Noemi Caroline’s bicycle. Take the hat. It’s fuzzy anyway.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you, ma’am. You are most generous.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her gaze falls off me and lands on the rug. A strange moment passes, then she
                        gracefully folds her hands as if warming them around a teacup. Her smile teeters. “We shall see
                        you tomorrow, then.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9"> WAIT UNTIL </span>Old Gin and I have stepped off the
                        Payne Estate before blurting out, “Why were you talking to Billy Riggs?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His forehead pinches. “Turtle egg,” he growls, a Chinese insult. “He claims one
                        of the Chinese owed his father money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Someone who left before you were born.” The gray in his brown eyes suddenly
                        looks like iron streaks in ore. “If you see this turtle egg again, stay away from him. We do not
                        need his reek in our nose, hm?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The streetcar arrives, and we drag our tired bodies aboard, along with other
                        workers. In the streets, a different citizenry moves about. These ride carriages with polished
                        seats, and their eyes roam freely about the scenery.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre21">Old Gin slides in next to me. “On the way home from the
                        baths, I saw twin Shetlands.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He means the Shetlands belonging to the Bells’ landlord, who only visits when
                        the rent is late. “That’s the third time this year.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He nods. “If Bells evicted, landlord will build a factory.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A factory is more lucrative than a single home. We will have to leave when the
                        place is torn down. The memory of Carcass Alley tightens my belly. Where would we go?
                        Southerners do not like the Chinese living among them, as Lucky Yip could have attested. Shiny
                        pink scars covered half of his body from the fire that ruffians set to his shanty in
                        Mississippi, where he was building railroads. The Chinese who drifted this way lived in shadows,
                        and shadows were not easy to come by.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin notices me grimacing and tsks his tongue. “Do not worry. I have taken
                        steps to ensure our future, even if that future is not in Atlanta.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His words throw a switch, halting my other thoughts. For all its faults,
                        Atlanta would be a hard city to leave, with its generous sunshine, rolling hills, and ladylike
                        breezes. Seventeen years of living here has mapped its streets and alleyways into my veins.
                        “What steps?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Many Chinese in Augusta. Maybe a husband.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Augusta, Georgia, lies over a hundred fifty miles east, its bachelors mostly
                        men who’d come to dig the canal. Something sour rises in my throat. “I have no desire to be
                        someone’s wife.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Consternation pulls the wrinkles on Old Gin’s face. “Motherhood is a most noble
                        calling. My own mother was only sixteen when she married, but she raised two good sons.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It is hard to argue with that. Unlike the other uncles, Old Gin was not one of
                        the laborers brought to Mississippi during Reconstruction, but hails from a line of
                        scholar-officials in the Qing dynasty. His mother was a gentlewoman who attended her sons with
                        great devotion, and was esteemed among his father’s wives.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What would you do if you did not raise a family? Hats?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My shoulders droop. Hats had given me a way to put my fingerprint on the world,
                        but Mrs. English had seen to it that I wouldn’t get another apprenticeship here. “Maybe I
                        haven’t discovered it yet. But do you remember when you told Hammer Foot that a cricket is
                        happiest when it sings?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He nods. “Hammer Foot hated digging ditches. He liked performance.” Hammer Foot
                        could walk a tightrope blindfolded. I’d seen it with my own eyes. He’d headed north, where he
                        hoped to join P. T. Barnum’s Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan, and Hippodrome. “Of course,
                        not always easy to find work you love.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I know. But you did.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre21">“I told you I have been lucky, hm? Still, a good partner
                        can support you while you discover this purpose. We will find you one with a big nose.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">W<span class="calibre9">ITH ONE EAR </span>stuck to the wall, I listen hard for
                        clues that Miss Sweetie might be making her debut soon. The rumblings from the printing press
                        obscure the conversation, but Nathan eventually takes a break.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Striking,” he says. “Looks . . . oriental?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes,” comes his mother’s voice. “A Chinese girl made it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her hat’s embellishment. My neck aches from the effort of keeping still.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You don’t say. I ran into a Chinese girl the other day. At least, Bear did.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What did she look like?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Startled.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As did mine. What else?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t know, Mother,” he says with impatience. “She had two eyes, two legs .
                        . .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I grit my teeth, remembering the exposure of the legs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh good, for a minute I thought she might have had three. If we were ever held
                        up, how would you describe the perpetrator to the police? The young woman I saw was pretty,
                        about your age, five foot and some change, with soft brown eyes the color of chestnuts. She had
                        creamy skin&mdash;I suppose all hatters are good about keeping out of the sun&mdash;and she had
                        a careful way of moving around. She didn’t throw herself about like some young people. Stop
                        twitching. So, what do you think?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I think, if she ever holds us up, you’d better do the describing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We don’t see many Chinese around here, especially after the Rabid-Eyes Rapist.
                        Of course, you were too young to remember that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I read Father’s articles.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I allow myself a breath. They never did catch the Rabid-Eyes Rapist, but they
                        caught another man who looked like him&mdash;if you ignored the ten-inch difference in height.
                        The unfortunate soul was eventually cleared, but only after they had hanged him from a stout
                        oak. The Chinese who remained in Atlanta began drifting away after that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I suppose that could be who I saw,” says Nathan at last.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I didn’t catch her name. Perhaps I will ask Mrs. English tomorrow. I’m curious
                        about her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I stifle a gasp. Hammer Foot says when people make connections, their energies
                        seek one another out with more frequency as the mind strives to see patterns. That’s why Old Gin
                        was so strict with the uncles about following rules. Footprints are not just left on the ground.

                    <h2>Ten</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">My muscles protest as I shift around the bench of the
                            streetcar,</span> scanning passengers for copies of the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>, ears
                        attuned to any mention of the word <i class="calibre7">sweetie</i>. Though 90 percent of me
                        dreads the Bells’ accepting my proposal, the 10 percent of me that wishes for it is a vocal (and
                        regrettably vainglorious) minority. A man in front of me is reading the <i
                            class="calibre7">Savannah Tribune</i>, one of the few colored newspapers available in this
                        town. Beside me, a butler unfolds the <i class="calibre7">Constitution</i>, clutching it closer
                        to him when I try to get a look. At least the Paynes will have a copy. They subscribe to every
                        newspaper, save the colored and the Jewish ones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The air is shrouded in droplets, making it feel as if the morning is spitting
                        in my face. Every jostle of the streetcar seems designed to wreak maximum injury on my limbs.
                        Old Gin, though, takes the bumps in stride, serenely chewing on a piece of ginger. Shivering, I
                        slide closer to him, being careful not to muss my new “cheeky clouds” hairstyle with its rolled
                        bundles that peek out from my “borrowed” bonnet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I must spend tonight at the Paynes’,” says Old Gin, sidestepping my surprised
                        eyes. He’s been working late hours recently, but he’s never spent the night. “Merritt will be
                        arriving with a new Arabian stallion. Mr. Crycks wants me on hand, just in case.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt has always loved fast horses, just like his sister. An Arabian stallion
                        is sure to cause a stir among the mares who are in heat. “Where will you sleep?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“There’s an extra room besides Mr. Crycks’s in the work shed.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The work shed is always drafty.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If I’m cold, I’ll sleep in the stables.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre21">“The dust will hardly help your cough.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m only a little hoarse, hm?” He begins to laugh at his own joke, but when he
                        becomes short of breath, I fix him with a glare.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Will they compensate you for your additional work? You should not set a
                        precedent.” Of course, that would never happen. Folks like us are just lucky to have jobs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“There are rewards.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">May the rewards from his extra hours be worthy of the loss of his health.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Once at the Paynes’, Old Gin opens the kitchen door for me, but leaves before
                        anyone can attempt to feed him. Through the window, I spy Noemi bent over in the garden.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I assemble fist-size cinnamon buns dripping with honey and butter on a
                        doily-thin plate, betting that even my bad-tempered mistress won’t refuse this breakfast.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before I even reach the third floor, I can hear Caroline’s and her mother’s
                        voices, the rapid pace telling me how things lie. They must like to get their arguing over with
                        in the morning, sort of like milking the cows. It strikes me that money can alleviate many of
                        the miseries of common folk, but it opens up other avenues of suffering.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I park the tray on a side table and wait outside Caroline’s bedchambers for the
                        flames to cool. On the wall hangs a painting of a horse standing atop a knoll, his tail high,
                        ears rigid. A herd of black sheep graze in the valley below it, kept in line by a fierce-looking
                        dog. The painting probably gave the artist a mean hand cramp with all the tiny strokes, but
                        something about the scene puts an itch under my skin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hear Old Gin’s voice in my head. <i class="calibre7">Fancy horse like that
                            wouldn’t just be strolling around, free as a bird, hm?</i> Noemi might wonder why the sheep
                        are all black and stuck at the bottom of the hill, a question that four years of bloody battles
                        between the states and twenty-five years of Reconstruction still haven’t answered. For me, the
                        piece is simply banal&mdash;one of Nathan’s favorite words. For once, couldn’t the artist show
                        the things people don’t pay attention to? Like the wind. Maybe the wind wouldn’t be so invisible
                        if people took the time to notice it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I detect a lull in the conversation, I shoulder into the room. “Good
                        morning, ma’am. Miss.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne pulls the African violet away from Caroline, lying in bed, and a
                        trail of soil spills onto the woman’s apricot skirts. She dusts them off with a few flicks of
                        her fingers. “Good morning, Jo.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Unlike her mother, Caroline holds her displeasure up for all to see: two hot
                        spots on her cheeks, a scowling mouth, and eyes narrowed to slits. I might have been wrong about
                        the cinnamon buns, which seem to have been frightened into silence and no longer smell. I set
                        the tray on her table and pour the coffee.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne paints on a bright smile. “Jo, we were just
                        discussing whether common horses can compete alongside pedigreed horses. As Old Gin’s daughter,
                        perhaps you are knowledgeable about things like pedigrees.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My gut tells me to demure, but then Caroline pipes up. “She’s certainly
                        knowledgeable about being common.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pass Caroline her mug of coffee, fixing her with a look to remind her of our
                        agreement. I can see the loathing in her eyes, and I can’t help wondering if, instead of moving
                        us to a more temperate clime, I’ve summoned winter forever. She lowers her eyes and takes the
                        coffee.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“With the proper training and advantages, I think any horse can be great.
                        Family name is a burden unique to humans.” I pick a cushion off the floor and bring it to the
                        open window to shake out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline slurps her drink. “You see, Mama, the maid agrees with me. Now you
                        must let Thief race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Q’s horse, Thief? A <i class="calibre7">race</i>horse? I give the pillow I
                        am holding an extra slap. It gives me a stitch in the flank to know I have unwittingly taken
                        Caroline’s side.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her gloating eyes crest the rim of her mug, and I wish I could take back my
                        words. The tricky thing about giving opinions is that sometimes they cost you more than you
                        wanted to spend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne sighs. “The sponsors are paying good money to put their name on a
                        horse. They won’t be happy to receive Thief.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline slides languidly off her bed and settles herself at her table. “Maybe
                        the Atlanta Suffragists will win a bid and you can give Thief to them.” She holds up a fist and
                        chirps, “Equal votes for all.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne lets out a ladylike huff. “Heaven forbid they could scrape together
                        enough to qualify.” She stiffly crosses to the door. “Your friends will be here soon. Jo, that
                        is a fetching hairstyle. Perhaps you can do the same for Caroline.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline tears a chunk off a bun with her teeth, sugaring her lips. Something
                        tells me the taste is not very sweet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9">N THE DRAWING </span>room where the Paynes receive their
                        visitors, golden curtains pool onto milky carpets. A gilded piano plays catch and throw with the
                        late-morning light streaming in from the windows. This is not the room to be caught smacking
                        your lips or scratching your nits. The simple arrangement of furniture puts every guest on
                        display, the sofas extra plush to encourage lingering while they slowly digest you.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre21">Noemi pours glasses of lemonade for the two ladies seated
                        at a circular table. She moves away, and I recognize two crushed-velvet capotes, hats made by my
                        own hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My eyes pop out when I recognize Miss Saltworth and Miss Culpepper, bright as
                        petunias in pink and violet frocks. The sweet scent of Salt’s Eau de Lilac perfume mingles with
                        that of the lemon furniture oil and cigar smoke.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Well, if the sun hasn’t risen in the west. Old money likes to think it weighs
                        more than new money, and Caroline, at least the Caroline I knew, only associated with girls
                        whose families have carried around their wealth for generations. But perhaps she has dropped her
                        old acquaintances after her years away at school, and is in need of new ones. Funny enough, I
                        don’t remember her having many friends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt’s round face splits open. “Why, it’s Jo! Whatever are you doing here?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pepper’s dark eyes sweep down my uniform. Unlike the curvy Salt, Pepper’s as
                        slim as a fiddle string with a deeper bass of a voice. “Oh! She’s a maid.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My reversal of fortune lands like a dead pigeon on the carpet. “It’s nice to
                        see you, Miss Saltworth, Miss Culpepper.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">You’re</i> Caroline’s new maid?” Salt was always half a
                        step behind Pepper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m afraid so,” Caroline drawls before I can answer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi winks at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Caroline!” Pepper folds herself back into a chair. “If I’d known Jo was up for
                        grabs, I would’ve taken her in a heartbeat.” Hope rises in my chest until she adds, “That is, if
                        I didn’t already have my Martha.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt pulls a blond ringlet with a doughy finger, and then lets it snap back
                        into place. “And if I didn’t already have my Lucy, I would’ve taken her, too. Think of all the
                        hats. Plus, Jo knows the cleverest hairstyles.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pepper rubs her thin hands together. “I have an idea. Maybe Jo could do
                        Melly-Lee’s hair. What do you say, Caroline?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline, who had refused all hairstyles except for her Newport knot, wrings
                        her mouth into a grim smile. “Of course. Maid, go fetch a brush and pins.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I return with the items, Mrs. Payne has joined the threesome, the perfect
                        model of poise as she deals the cards. Unlike Caroline, her spine doesn’t touch the back of the
                        chair. And unlike Salt, whose knees bounce under her pink gingham skirt like two frogs caught
                        under a picnic blanket, the lady of the house has mastered the art of sitting quietly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After brushing out Salt’s considerable white-blond mane, I begin to weave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I was little, Lucky Yip and Hammer Foot let me braid their queues, mostly
                        to keep my fingers out of their games of Chinese chess. Lucky Yip would turn red in the face
                        when he found his hair done up in a “staircase to the heavens,” but Hammer Foot always accepted
                        his hairdo with a grateful bow.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre21">I have often wondered if either of them was my father,
                        but quickly dismissed the idea. Hammer Foot had been almost monk-like in his dedication to
                        virtuous and harmonious living, while Lucky Yip was a devoted family man, sending every penny he
                        earned back to China.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt wiggles her shoulders, and I lose my grip on her hair. Gritting my teeth,
                        I retrace my work. “If this looks fetching on me,” she gushes, “maybe I’ll ask Mr. Q to the
                        horse race today.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline trains her cold gaze on a birdcage that contains no bird.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne tosses down her winning hand. “I wish more ladies had your spirit.
                        Ever since Mrs. Wordsworth forbade her daughters from asking, no one wants to do it. Atlanta
                        Belles can be so stuffy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pepper and Salt exchange an uncomfortable glance. Not every branch in Atlanta
                        can be bought, like the premier ladies’ society, Atlanta Belles, where membership can only be
                        inherited. Pepper shuffles the deck, all elbows and thumbs. “Miss Sweetie approves, too. Did you
                        see the new advice column in the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>, Caroline?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The braid goes uneven again, but not because of Salt this time. The Bells
                        published it? My shaking fingers grip the braid tighter, twisting and winding.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She told women to ‘quit their stalling’ because their gentlemen may not be
                        available ‘furlong.’ Isn’t she a holler?” Pepper laughs and the deck nearly scatters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s mouth puckers, like her lemonade is too sour.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne discreetly returns a card that has flown into her lap back into
                        Pepper’s deck. “Jo, fetch Mr. Payne’s copy of the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am.” I pin Salt’s braid to hold my place.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">This time, I nearly fly up the staircase.</p>

                    <h2>Eleven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">All is quiet on the second floor, where Mr. Payne keeps
                            his office.</span> The man rises earlier than even Etta Rae and stays at the mills past
                        sundown most days of the week. Beyond the family telephone, which used to scare me with its
                        unpredictable shrieking, the door to Mr. Payne’s office is closed. I knock once, just in case,
                        but no one answers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Payne’s quarters haven’t changed a bit since the last time I was here. A
                        desk carved from good old Southern red oak anchors one end of the room, along with a matching
                        chair cut extra-large, though the man barely reaches five and a half feet. The somber walls are
                        infused with the scent of tobacco smoke and the ylang-ylang oil Mr. Payne uses to keep his curly
                        hair flat. The smell stirs up memories of my first encounter with him. Old Gin had come here to
                        discuss a matter, and I had tagged along, only four or five at the time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Smoke from the man’s cigar billowed out of his nose and his ears. “Are you a
                        boy or a girl?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I’d been wearing trousers, and my hair was cut above my ears, so the mistake
                        was understandable. “Girl,” I replied. “Are you a man or a dragon?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His eyes bulged, and I thought he would eat me up. But then he let out a wheezy
                        laugh and jabbed his cigar toward me. “That one has trouble spelled all over her face, mark my
                        words, Old Gin.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shake myself from the memory and cross to the desk. Several newspapers are
                        piled in a neat stack, with the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> second from the bottom. I unfold
                        the newspaper, and my fingers leave damp spots on the paper. There on the front page in bold
                        type reads:</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre20"><b class="calibre26">INAUGURAL
                                ADVICE COLUMN FOR DEAR MISS SWEETIE&mdash;</b></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre20"><b class="calibre26">SHE ADVISES ALL</b></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Below the title, Nathan had drawn the silhouette of a lady in an old-fashioned
                        hat adorned with cabbage roses, brandishing an ostrich quill. A giggle fizzles out my nose at
                        the cross-hatching that emphasizes a feminine waist, and at the delicate poise of the arms,
                        which are a far cry from these drumsticks. <i class="calibre7">Well, Nathan, I am not the lady
                            you imagine me to be, but may you never find out</i>. So much for my misgivings of last
                        night. I bounce on the balls of my feet and squeal. People will be reading my words, <i
                            class="calibre7">my</i> words. I hug the paper and circle the desk one way and then the
                        other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. English’s advertisement for English’s Millinery occupies a prime seat next
                        to my byline. May she be enjoying the glacial pace at which her star worker, Lizzie, moves, and
                        the clumsy way she trims, using paste when she should be using stitches.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Below the ad, another catches my eye. Pendergrass’s Long-Life Elixir promises
                        to rid one of “anything that ails you, including dyspepsia, cough, liver spots, toothache,
                        lethargia, diarrhea, ingrown toenails, warts, and especially impotence. If we don’t fix your
                        problem in three days, we’ll refund your fifty cents with no questions asked. Sold at
                        Buxbaum’s.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I float back down the stairs, clutching the paper. Would Pendergrass’s elixir
                        work for Old Gin’s deterioration? Ordinarily, I disregard such snake oils, but Buxbaum’s stands
                        behind its products.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">By the time I bring the paper to Mrs. Payne, I have composed my face into
                        something resembling a cheese curd, mild and unremarkable. Caroline leans over to read the
                        article, her eyes narrowing as they go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">While she reads, I return to Salt’s braid. Salt and Pepper polish off their
                        sandwiches, and Noemi brings around a tray loaded with more. “More egg salad, misses?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pepper takes two. “These could use more pepper.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, miss,” Noemi says deferentially.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m allergic to pepper,” Caroline snaps, still reading the paper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Not everything has to have pepper, Linney.” Salt plucks up a sandwich, pulling
                        loose the strand I’m trying to braid by her ear. “Noemi could make a hash out of a block of
                        wood, and I bet it would slide down the gullet.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi dips her head and murmurs, “Thank you, miss.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne raps the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> with her index finger. “This
                        column is just the thing.” She gets up from her seat. “I’m sorry to leave the game, ladies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What are you up to, Mama?” Caroline demands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I shall buy as many copies of the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> as I can for
                        tonight’s meeting of the Atlanta Belles. Melly-Lee, you should definitely ask your Mr. Q today.”
                        She glides out of the room.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-107" class="calibre21">I tie an extra-loopy ribbon around Salt’s braid, feeling
                        a little loopy myself. Perhaps this edition will be a sellout. Long-term subscriptions are what
                        count, but Miss Sweetie is off to a grand start.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hold a mirror in front of Salt, who tests the limit of her neck, twisting to
                        see every angle of her new hairstyle. With her curls, her hair resembles more a bubbling spring
                        than a waterfall. “Oh, oh!” Salt squeals, pressing her sandwich to her heart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Look out, Mr. Q,” breathes Pepper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s frosty glare is enough to keep the glass of lemonade she is drinking
                        chilled for hours. “If I have to hear another word about Mr. Q, I may need a tincture for
                        headache.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pepper cuts her green eyes to Salt and shakes her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt pats Caroline’s hand. “Oh, don’t be cross with me, Caroline.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Well, that is a horse saddled backward. If Salt knew how Miss P was minding her
                        Q, she wouldn’t be simpering like that. The chores seem to fly by while I fantasize about my
                        alter ego as a columnist for the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>. When it’s time for our ride,
                        Caroline sets off at a fast clip for Our Lord’s Cemetery, and I hardly notice until she is out
                        of sight. Entertaining one’s lover’s sweetheart must build up a powerful thirst.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato carries the distinguished yet enigmatic advice columnist off for a
                        romp of her own.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Six Paces Meadow got its name from a duel gone wrong, when one of the duelists
                        turned at six paces instead of ten and shot off his opponent’s top story. It is said that the
                        ghost of the wronged still haunts this lot, which is why Old Gin liked to bring the “honored
                        sons and daughters” of the stable here&mdash; we mostly had the field to ourselves. Old Gin
                        reassured me that a ghost without its head could not see, hear, or smell, so the chances of
                        bumping into it were slim.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What about the ghost of the head?” I asked, but he didn’t have an answer for
                        that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We clear a grove of trees and an abandoned hansom cab, which hasn’t moved in
                        the years since Old Gin used it to boost me onto the horses. “Don’t be afraid,” he assured me
                        once I got topside. “I am right here beside you, though you might not always see me.” The
                        memories forged in this field were sweet and tinged with summer gold.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Thickets of bright sassafras and old man’s beard have crept into the meadow,
                        and even clusters of young trees. When I began my women’s cycles, the only thing Old Gin said
                        about it was that all meadows, after an awkward stretch as a thicket, eventually ripen into
                        beautiful forests. That left me more confused than ever. There were bits about being a mother
                        even Old Gin couldn’t replace.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre21">Sweet Potato whinnies. She’s been to this playground
                        before, but not with me. Old Gin hadn’t started to break her yet when Mrs. Payne dismissed me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“For my next article, perhaps I will write about what to do if you’re in love
                        with someone else’s man. I’ll call it, ‘Why Buy the Pig If the Sausage Is Free?’” I laugh
                        wickedly, and I swear Sweet Potato snorts. “Or maybe I’ll write about the blacklisting of
                        milliner’s assistants. ‘Watch Your Hat.’” Sweet Potato paws at the ground, probably bored. “All
                        right, enough about me. Show me your legs.” With a good tap of my heels, I cry, “Giddap!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato answers with a neigh like a trumpet, surging forward so fast, I
                        leave my breath behind. A thousand pounds of muscle and bone stretch and collect under me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Wahooo!” I bump along like a feather in a top hat, just trying to hang on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Moments later, I find my rhythm, and the ride goes easier for both of us. We
                        weave through dense strawberry bush, skirting wet slicks as smoothly as a hawk dancing through
                        air currents. The meadow transforms into ribbons of green and yellow streaking past me, and the
                        air plasters my smile to my face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A shriek splits the air. From out of nowhere, another horse powers up beside
                        us, a bay with a distinctive wedge-shaped head. I nearly tumble off my seat when I recognize the
                        rider as none other than Caroline’s brother, Merritt. He snaps a riding crop. “Giddap! C’mon,
                        Jo, to the hansom!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mischief dangles from his smile like a feather from a cat’s mouth, and the good
                        looks that hail from his mother’s side tie my stomach into complicated knots. Of all the people
                        to catch me in a lark, why Merritt Payne?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">While I wrestle with my memories, the bay, who must be Merritt’s new Arabian,
                        bursts away like a squall. Sweet Potato charges after him. My thighs burn as I struggle to hang
                        on. Hooves thunder across the meadow, scaring the blackbirds off their bug hunts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I lean as far forward as my legs will allow, standing slightly with my bum
                        bouncing along the saddle as we try to catch up. I should be running in the other direction, but
                        Merritt has already seen me. I will need to assure myself that he will not tell his mother. The
                        Arabian’s ears flick, monitoring us with his keen hearing. As we close in, he surges another
                        length ahead, the cheeky tassel of his tail taunting us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The heat of battle lights my skin on fire. “You’re not going to let that frisky
                        wedge-head sass us, are you?” I dig my heels in deeper, and Sweet Potato lunges, closing the
                        distance once again. “Thatta girl!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But then a mud slick flashes twenty yards ahead, and we veer to avoid it,
                        losing ground. As we fall behind, the stallion slows, too, ears flicking. Horses are like
                        people. Some work better under pressure. The more hat orders we got at the millinery, the faster
                        I worked, unlike, for example, Lizzie, who crawled at the same snail’s pace regardless of
                        whether it rained or shined.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre21">We clear the slick and then charge ahead, the hansom in
                        clear view only a furlong away. As we approach, the stallion&mdash;now two lengths
                        away&mdash;ups his tempo again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I crouch low over Sweet Potato’s neck. My hat blows away in the heat of battle,
                        and my hair streams behind me like a black banner. “Come on, Sweetie, dig in!” I yell, bracing
                        myself for the final few yards.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We push and grunt, heaving forward as if there were a knife coming down on our
                        back. But Merritt lays on his crop, and the Arabian cruises across the line.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thatta boy!” Merritt cries, throwing up his hat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My breath comes in gulps, and I lean over Sweet Potato’s neck as she slows her
                        speed, her tongue tipped out one side of her mouth. Merritt sidles up to us, his oval face one
                        gloating grin as the Arabian dances and skitters under him. In the four years since I saw him
                        last, the Payne heir has puffed out his piecrust, as Noemi might say. His coat no longer sags
                        upon a too-slim frame; the gray wool skims his muscled shoulders. The mustache that was only a
                        smear at seventeen is now pointed and trim, accenting his upper lip like the hands of a handsome
                        grandfather clock stuck at three forty-five.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He hooks one leg upon his saddle. “It wasn’t a fair fight,” he says in that
                        animated tone he uses for everything, even something so mundane as “looks like rain.” “Girls
                        just don’t have enough coal in the box. Still, pretty legs like those would fetch a pretty sum,
                        if Old Gin ever wants to sell.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, sir,” I reply, even though Old Gin would sooner sell his own pretty legs
                        than Sweet Potato’s. Perhaps I can tell Merritt Caroline sent me on an errand . . . in the
                        middle of a haunted meadow . . .</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“This is Ameer.” The Arabian stands a hand taller than Sweet Potato, with a
                        cresty neck and hind legs like birch trunks. Tossing his head, he puffs and struts the way males
                        do when they know the females are watching. Sweet Potato, who is not in season, pulls the heads
                        off a clump of daisies. “His name means ‘chief,’ and he’s faster than a hat in a hurricane.
                        Those other horses will be eating his dust.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He’s on the roster?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am. Even got Johnny Fortune to ride him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Johnny Fortune?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Best jockey in the States.” His blue-gray eyes glint like war medals. “He’s
                        like a bird on a fence. You can’t topple him. Father isn’t happy about it &mdash;why play when
                        you can work?&mdash;but it’s Mama’s race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Payne is grooming Merritt to take over his mills, but Merritt has always
                        been more interested in pleasure than paper. “Well, good luck with that. I must be on my&mdash;”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I hear you’re wrangling my little sister these days.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I brace myself.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre21">“Where is she?” He glances around him with mock concern.
                        “There are no silken divans here on which to rest her mollycoddled posterior.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Paying her respects.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I see. To whom?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Friends.” Dearly departed ones. I cringe as the net closes over me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Wonderful. If she were visiting enemies, I fear that would take all month.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I cough. It is no secret that Caroline is the sort of girl many like but few
                        love. Merritt’s grin stretches, while I scrape around for a lie.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He wiggles his fingers. “Jo, I don’t wish to vex you. Women’s pettifogs are the
                        least of my concerns right now.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What do you mean?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He sighs. “Father wants me to settle down, gain some respectability, <i
                            class="calibre7">work</i>, of all things. I’m supposed to be at the mills. And my bride,
                        Jane Bentley of Boston, is a bore who insists on staying through the horse race, which means I
                        must ferry her around everywhere. It isn’t fair. I am only twenty-one, and still have
                        many”&mdash;his eyes widen a fraction&mdash;“wrong turns left to make.” Even as a lad, Merritt
                        was always a rake, catching the neighborhood girls by their pigtails and kissing their cheeks.
                        “If only she had your spunk. You haven’t forgotten Chattahoochee?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My cheeks warm. When I was eleven and Merritt fifteen, he’d gotten it into his
                        head that he would catch dinner. His father had taken him fishing at the Chattahoochee River the
                        week before, but the only thing Merritt had caught was a cold. After he failed to return by late
                        day, Mrs. Payne sent me to look for him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I found him throwing rocks into a pool at the base of a waterfall. He was
                        drenched. “Forgot to bring hooks.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A trout leaped off the top of the fall. In fact, there were so many trout, the
                        water was a writhing, silvery mass.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“There are other ways to catch a fish.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’ve tried,” he lamented. “They’re too slippery.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato bugles out a neigh, startling me from my thoughts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt pushes back the round top of his gambler-style hat, exposing
                        squirrel-brown hair shot with gold. “I was doing it all wrong. Trying to catch a fish with my
                        hands was like trying to wrestle a greased hog. You showed me how to catch it only long enough
                        to sling it onto the riverbank. We caught five.” He chuckles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That’s Old Gin’s trick, sir. The fish just need redirection.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No ‘sir.’ It’s just ‘Merritt’ between friends.” Sea-blue eyes travel around my
                        face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He got me fired. I have never known the Payne heir to be wicked in the way men
                        with money can be, but a maid cannot be too cautious around her master.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre21">“Well, good day, sirs.” Sweet Potato carries us off. When
                        I glance back around, Merritt, still watching, gives me a bow.</p>

                            Caroline still</span> doesn’t appear. Perhaps she didn’t hear the bell chime from the chapel
                        at Our Lord’s Cemetery. Or perhaps she did hear, but simply does not care to be on time. Or
                        perhaps she was kidnapped by a band of kangaroos, and a ransom note will be punched through the
                        door shortly.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-112" class="calibre21">I steer Sweet Potato back toward the cemetery.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sounds and smells always feel amplified when one walks through a graveyard. It
                        would seem that Death, having visited each of these souls already, has no more business here.
                        But the Chinese believe death simply moves a soul to an ancestral state of existence, and that
                        the dead cause mischief if not properly appeased. So there could be plenty of trouble to be
                        found among these tombstones, and I should watch my step.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The stony angels of the Innocenti vault implore me to relieve them with their
                        pupil-less eyes. Frederick and Thief are still tucked in the wooded area behind the vault,
                        minding their own business. Poor spoony Salt, with no idea that her beloved is dipping his pen
                        in the neighboring inkwell.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Assured that Caroline has not been kidnapped by kangaroos, I’m about to steer
                        Sweet Potato back to the water trough but stop when I hear a voice coming from the vault. “She’s
                        warming to the idea of Thief. But you won’t be paying much attention to the race anyway, with
                        Miss Saltworth to distract you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Thief throws back his head, his black mane splashing like a wave. The horse has
                        good bone structure and a well-muscled back end, but does he have the kind of ruthlessness
                        required to cross the finish line?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She means nothing to me.” I expect Mr. Q to have a velvety baritone, but his
                        voice has the soft tenor of a snake charmer, the kind of voice that could coax the gray out of
                        the clouds. “Her father will be moving them to New York soon, and of course she will understand
                        that I cannot go. We shall tell your parents then.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The words are chased by amorous murmurings, and I hastily exit before my ears
                        start to burn.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">F<span class="calibre9">RIDAY NIGHT JUST </span>after five o’clock, Mrs. Payne
                        gives me three dollars, which I secure in the waist pocket of my russet dress. Old Gin must stay
                        the weekend at the Payne Estate. Noemi bundles a wedge of cheese and crackers in a handkerchief
                        for me to carry to Old Gin, who neglected to come by for lunch. “This cheese will fatten him up
                        for sure.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I bundle myself into my cloak, then hike to the stables.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In the corral, a whip of a man with ears that stick out like maple pods puts
                        the stallion through his paces. A jockey’s cap is pulled nearly to a small hill of his nose.
                        This must be Johnny Fortune, the best jockey in the States. His squinty black eyes track me, his
                        expression landing squarely on disapproving. The two are watched by Merritt and Mr. Crycks, an
                        old cowboy who is all legs, door-knocker mustache, and hat.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre21">Sighting the curly oak where Billy Riggs accosted Old
                        Gin, I squeeze past the low hedge to inspect the trunk. Below eye level, two squares have been
                        carved, one containing four dots, the other, five. They must be dice&mdash;maybe lucky numbers.
                        The scratches are small, but it will be hard not to think of them each time I see this tree.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hurry into the stables, but not finding Old Gin there, I head to the barn
                        next door. Springtime means occasional work helping the caretaker with newborn kids and lambs.
                        In the barn, animals warm the air, their bleating and baaing a peaceful kind of music. I am
                        surprised to find Old Gin, his back to me, in a horse-riding stance. I thought he had given up
                        those strenuous exercises after Hammer Foot left. He holds the stance a full minute before
                        rising. “If you want to sneak up on old men, you should not bring such powerful cheese, hm?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I wanted to make sure you ate something.” I hold out the food to Old Gin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He takes it with a sigh. “Thank you, Jo.” He unwraps the bundle and offers me
                        some.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shake my head. “That’s for you to eat, and I won’t leave until you do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He sits on a bale of hay and takes a nibble so small, I despair of it making it
                        all the way down the hatch. He catches me glaring at him and pats the space beside him. “Let me
                        tell you a story, hm?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Reluctantly, I sit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A farmer whose crops had not bloomed sent his son to buy a peach to entice the
                        bats of fortune. And so the son found a fruit the color of a setting sun, one so large he could
                        hold it with both hands without the fingers touching.” He demonstrates, holding an imaginary
                        ball between his hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“On the way home, the son passed a lake. In the lake, a water nymph with golden
                        hair and eyes that looked cut from the lake itself bathed among the lotuses. Noticing the son,
                        the nymph swam to the edge of the lake. She looked at the son with such longing that he felt his
                        heart stir. But it was not the young man she wanted.” Old Gin stretches out his skinny arms and
                        makes his voice high. “‘I must have that peach. I have wished to taste such a fruit for so
                        long.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I bury a giggle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“‘What will you give me in return?’ asked the son. ‘A kiss,’ she said. So his
                        shaking hands passed her the peach.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The fool,” I mutter. “Let me guess. She takes the peach, he doesn’t get his
                        kiss, the bats don’t come, and the father’s crops die. Is that the end?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin grunts. “For now.” He cocks an ear toward me, waiting for me to dig out
                        the hidden meanings.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Am I the fool or the nymph?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre21">“You are too sentimental, and so you are the fool. I am
                        the nymph, because I don’t need the peach, hm?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I imagine knock-kneed Old Gin as a nymph, his scraggly beard dripping with
                        water, and burst out laughing. Soon, his own acorn face is split in a grin, and we are rocking
                        back and forth like the time we tried balancing on a cut log for fun. But then Old Gin’s
                        laughter sets off a cough, and my happiness drains away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Ameer screams from somewhere far off, somehow part of this conversation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin drinks from his water jug, and then replaces the cork. “You will be
                        okay minding the burrows?” He rubs at his mouth, more as if trying to erase his grimace than
                        dribbled water.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The burrows will be secure under my watch.” I polish up a smile, despite the
                        worries digging around my skull.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Ameer shrieks again, though more half-heartedly, as if he is beginning to tire.
                        “How’s the new jockey?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin’s shoulders stretch the fabric of his coat. “Good at coaxing speed, not
                        so good at coaxing character.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He lowers himself back into a horse-riding stance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You forgot the cheese.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I will eat cheese later. It has already waited a long time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>

                        the paved path, Noemi is half riding the safety by the work shed. “This is going to be more fun
                        than a frog race once I get the hang of it. Probably even beats riding a horse.” Her bushy
                        eyebrows wiggle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I doubt that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Only one way to find out. Oh, I forgot.” She puts a hand to her cheek. “You
                        ain’t ready to break your legs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The safety <i class="calibre7">does</i> look fun, its paint as glossy as a
                        candied apple.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“After a week with the porcupine, maybe I <i class="calibre7">am</i> ready to
                        break my legs.” Jo Kuan might not have taken such risks, but Miss Sweetie embraces the future,
                        including newfangled machinery. “As long as it doesn’t buck, I’m game.” I unclasp my cloak and
                        set it on a stump. Then I take one of the handlebars, laying my other hand on the triangle seat.
                        The leather feels smooth, almost slick, and it’s attached to the frame with metal coils to take
                        the jounce out of the bounce. A metal plate partly covers the back wheel to prevent one’s skirt
                        from being violently “freed” from one’s body. I begin to worry that might be the reason for the
                        term <i class="calibre7">freedom machines</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They say you’re supposed to coast first, with your feet hiked up to practice
                        balancing.” Noemi holds her hands out as if to imitate her feet. “That means we need to face
                        downhill.” Both the stables and the house lie at a slight decline from where we are standing.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre21">I face the bicycle toward the stables. If I start flying,
                        I would rather break my legs a little closer to Old Gin so he doesn’t have to travel far to
                        rescue me. Noemi holds the seat steady while I climb aboard. The frame curves low, allowing me
                        to pass my leg through to the other side instead of swinging it over as with a horse. I tuck my
                        skirts between my legs so they don’t cause trouble.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The bicycle is heavy. Miss Sweetie assures Jo Kuan that means a more stable
                        ride, like how a frigate feels less turbulence than a rowboat. Jo Kuan points out that heavier
                        could also mean deadlier, as an ant might know when a foot comes along. Miss Sweetie ignores her
                        and take a firm grip on the handlebars. A lever is attached to the right one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That’s the brake,” Noemi tells me. “You squeeze it to stop.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I try it out and feel a mild resistance. “What about this button?” I run my
                        finger along a metal piece the size of a doorknob attached to the left handlebar.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s a bell. Look.” She flips a switch on the doorknob, and a hammer strikes
                        the metal with a satisfying <i class="calibre7">ding!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What for?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“In case you want to ring for service, obviously.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But who would come?” Only after my words fall out do I notice the smile riding
                        up her face. She is as sly as the letter <i class="calibre7">u</i>, always sneaking in after <i
                            class="calibre7">q</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Slowly, I lift one foot, then the other. I wobble to one side and catch myself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi helps me pull the bicycle back to center. “Steady, August.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You . . . <i class="calibre7">named</i> the safety?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A name means respect. If you’re going to put your life into someone’s hands,
                        best start off on the right foot.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I topple to one side again, and Noemi neatly catches me. “Or the left.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ah. You chose August because it means ‘respected.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, I chose it because it’s the name of a month, the most powerful month on
                        the calendar. When August comes around, it brings a wrath hot enough to jerky the cows while
                        they’re standing in the fields.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“July’s not so balmy either.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She lifts an eyebrow so high, I wouldn’t be surprised if she could unhook it
                        and throw it like a lightning bolt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“August, be easy on me.” I lift my feet again, and let gravity coax me down the
                        incline. My toes touch down a few times, but soon, I am rolling! “I’m doing it, Noemi! I’m
                        coasting!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That’s ’cause I’m still holding you, you noodle.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre21">“Well, let go!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She cuts me loose, and the bicycle picks up speed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">August bobs one direction and then the other, but I keep my grip fused to the
                        horns. A flock of chickens scatters before me with panicked squawks. And then I’m hurling down
                        the road, fast as a spit seed. Before I hit anything, like the pavement, I squeeze the brake,
                        and the contraption comes to a shaky stop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I set down my anchors, and Noemi comes up behind me. “Did you see that?” I ask
                        breathlessly. “I was flying.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You barely went ten yards.” She brushes a hand toward me, meaning <i
                            class="calibre7">get off</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“August, you are hot enough to jerky the cows.” I roll the bicycle back to the
                        work shed, and then Noemi climbs aboard. After scooting along with her toes and then coasting a
                        few times, her feet find the pedals, and she’s pumping her way back toward the house. She is a
                        natural.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She disappears around a curve. When she doesn’t return, I work my way back
                        toward the house after her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My step slows when I reach the courtyard. Noemi stands with the bicycle forming
                        a fence of sorts between her and the Payne women. Judging by Caroline’s white-lipped scowl,
                        August has brought a wrath after all.</p>

                    <h2>Thirteen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">The sun cowers in the west, and despite my exertions,
                            the air</span> suddenly feels too brittle against my skin. Mrs. Payne’s skirted coat looks
                        hastily shrugged on, judging by how its collar traps her loose hair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It was bad enough that you gave my maid my hat, but now you’re giving this
                        uppity sass-mouthed nigra my bicycle?” Caroline’s face begins to blotch, even though she is the
                        only one not wearing a coat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We’re only lending the bicycle. Do be reasonable, Caroline. You wanted to give
                        it away.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If I had known it was going to her, I would never have given it up.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi squeezes the handlebars, her knuckles bunching in her black leather
                        gloves. “I’m sorry, ma’am. I don’t wish to make trouble.” With her head bowed, it’s hard to tell
                        that Noemi is the tallest of the three.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I said you can have it, and a lady is only as good as her word.” Mrs. Payne’s
                        blue eyes cock like a pair of pistols.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The moment holds an outraged breath. Caroline’s scornful expression has set in
                        her face like a fly in the aspic. Digging it out would only make it worse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi grinds her gaze into the dirt. “I’d be happy to pay for it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We all gape at her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How much does it cost, miss?” Noemi directs her question to the bow I tied at
                        Caroline’s waist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My papa bought it for a hundred dollars.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I cough out my shock, and everyone but Noemi looks at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Is there something you wished to say, Jo?” Mrs. Payne asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m sorry, ma’am, only that you could buy a horse for a hundred dollars, not a
                        good one, of course, but at least it’s got four working legs.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre21">Caroline’s outrage pops like a faulty incandescent bulb.
                        “Since when does my domestic’s opinion matter? Her soul’s even blacker than this nigra’s, and I
                        wish you hadn’t hired her back.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne sweeps her hair free from her coat. “That’s enough, Caroline. Maybe
                        you will think about the value of things before you cast them aside. Now, the bicycle cost more
                        like eighty dollars, but that was new.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ma’am, I’ll pay for it,” Noemi says without a hint of emotion. “I insist.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I furtively shake my head at Noemi, but she won’t meet my eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A smile slithers up Caroline’s face. “Half now, half next week.” She picks a
                        thread off her sleeve and feeds it to the breeze.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Outrageous. Noemi doesn’t have eighty dollars to throw away. The lengths the
                        haves will go to in order to deprive the have-nots boggles the mind. Even Miss Sweetie has no
                        answer for it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi clears her throat. “Ma’am, how about you withhold my wages until it’s
                        paid?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne’s gaze passes between Caroline and Noemi and then lands on me. She
                        pulls her coat closed, and suddenly she looks smaller. It’s as if battling with Caroline has
                        wrung her out. She twists at her wedding band, an old habit. Mrs. Payne gives Noemi an
                        exasperated smile. “That will be fine. Well, good evening, then.” With a shake of her head, she
                        returns to the house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Move it back to the work shed for now, you hear?” Caroline wags her finger
                        toward the shed, as if Noemi doesn’t know where it’s located even after working here all her
                        life. “Only hussies ride bicycles,” she hisses as Noemi rolls August away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">N<span class="calibre9">OEMI MARCHES DOWN </span>Peachtree as if the world were
                        depending on her to turn it. Her gloved hands are balled into fists, and the skirt of her
                        brown-checkered dress doesn’t dare tangle in her legs. When we reach the streetcar stop, she
                        sails right by. She glances back at me, half walking, half trotting to catch up. “Robby’s
                        delivering on the other side of town today, and I feel like walking. You don’t have to come.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If Robby’s delivering, then he must not have gotten the clerk job after all. I
                        don’t mention it&mdash;there are more pressing issues to discuss&mdash;but this is exactly the
                        kind of injustice Miss Sweetie must speak to. I march doggedly alongside her, trying to catch my
                        breath. “You didn’t ask for my opinion, but it’s free for the taking.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Go on.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I’m about to tell her the hazards of spending money she doesn’t have for things
                        she doesn’t need to spite people she shouldn’t spite. But her grim expression blows the words
                        like dust from my mouth. “Never mind.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-118" class="calibre21">Noemi sighs. “Mama’s been dead for almost ten years, but
                        Caroline still counts the silverware every night.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I was seven when we lost Noemi’s mother, Caroline’s mammy. At her burial, the
                        world seemed to grow colder and more distant on that dark October day, and the scrape of the
                        shovel sounded like a hawk sharpening its claws. Caroline had insisted on attending, even though
                        the cemetery was for colored only. But when the reverend began eulogizing, she began keening so
                        loud, her father had to take her away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Twenty yards in front of us, a terrier strains at its leash, its fierce
                        expression at odds with its stubby body. I instinctively shrink away. The dog’s owner strolls
                        leisurely behind, chatting with another white lady. Ignoring Noemi, who steps into the busy
                        street, their collective gaze sweeps over me, surprise tinged with distrust. I’m about to follow
                        Noemi into the street when the terrier lunges at me, scaring me there faster.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Fluffers!” The dog’s owner tugs him back with a snap of her ruffled wrist. She
                        hurries after her friend, but the terrier throws an extra snap in my direction.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Cocky mutt,” Noemi mutters. “You okay?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nod, though my heart could probably beat Ameer in a sprint. A carriage
                        barrels toward us, and Noemi pulls me back to the sidewalk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I’m about to bring up the subject of the bicycle again when Noemi’s stout boots
                        stop marching. In the grassy yard of a brick law office, men are hoisting up a statue. Weakening
                        sunlight glints off the bronze figure of a Confederate officer, his chest puffed out like a
                        sail.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why would anyone want to build a monument for a war they lost?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Because they ain’t good at losing. And that’s another reason why I want that
                        bicycle. It’s bad enough we got the dogs barking us into place, now they’re putting up statues
                        to remind us, too. We have to fight for every inch or we’ll lose it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Every inch of what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“When’s the last time you saw a colored on a bicycle?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“About thirty minutes ago.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She bumps me with her arm. “Colored folks don’t ride bicycles, but it don’t
                        mean we can’t. We got to act how we want people to treat us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The men notice us watching them, and we hurry away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But, you’re going to make your point with a bicycle? Why not choose something
                        less costly, like not stepping off the sidewalk.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her eyelids peel back. “You want a gang of white hoods to jump me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Of course not.” I interlace my fingers in Old Gin’s good-fortune gesture.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi watches me shaking my hands as if I were winding up to throw dice. “Old
                        Gin does that whenever that old billy goat runs by.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre21">“He doesn’t trust things that are white like that goat.
                        Chinese people use white for funerals.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her cheekbones become knobs. “Ha! We got a lot in common, Old Gin and me. Don’t
                        worry about the cost. I’ll borrow from my no-account brother if I have to.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Whatever I was going to say dies on my tongue. I always figured her no-account
                        brother had, well, no account.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Here’s the thing. Unlike the sidewalk, there ain’t rules yet for bicycles.
                        Means we got to jump in and make the rules.” She waggles her eyebrows at me. “Or someone else
                        will make them for us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">W<span class="calibre9">ITH THE BASEMENT </span>all mine, I decide to give
                        myself a thorough scrubbing with leftover tea in our kitchen. Nature tells all animals to get
                        clean, and when we don’t, some powerful odors build up, not to mention the jibbies. At Mrs.
                        English’s, I’d see women ruin their hats scratching to get at the itch underneath, when they
                        could’ve avoided the problem by simply washing their hair now and then.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I dry mine by passing it over a frying pan I heated on the stove and then braid
                        it into five strands for tomorrow’s pagoda hairstyle. Then I pad over to Old Gin’s room for
                        paper. The drawer where we keep it sticks, even though Old Gin regularly waxes the wood. I slide
                        open the drawer underneath, which contains scraps of fabric. A length of scarlet silk lies atop
                        the heap.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pull it out. “What are you doing here?” Old Gin had brought the cloth to the
                        Beautiful Country&mdash;America&mdash;one of two items that had belonged to his late wife. I
                        open the silk. To my horror, it falls into several irregular pieces. He <i
                            class="calibre7">cut</i> it? But why?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hold up a piece&mdash;definitely the beginnings of a sleeve. I measure it
                        against my arm. It’s just my length.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My stomach squeezes into a cold knot. He’s making something for me. A wedding
                        garment? Chinese women wear red on their wedding day, as it’s the color of happiness and luck.
                        Is he planning to give me away so soon? And to whom? He said he had taken steps to assure our
                        future, but it still comes as a shock.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I should be grateful for Old Gin’s care all these years. If not for me, he
                        could’ve returned to China to fetch another wife, who might’ve given him sons. At sixty now, he
                        is too old to marry. Once I am “taken care of,” at least he can put some dust on his soles, as
                        he has always wished to do. For all the time he spends with horses, he never gets to travel far.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Still, the realization that I have been a burden tears something deep inside
                        me. I wipe my eyes with the sleeve and tuck it back in the drawer.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-120" class="calibre21">I hope my parents appreciated him for the job he took on.
                        Wherever they are.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Wondering about my parents is a strange kind of agony, an itch that I can’t
                        help scratching until it causes pain. Mostly, I think about my mother. There’s a good chance my
                        father was a cad&mdash;he wouldn’t be the first to love and leave a woman. It’s harder for a
                        woman to leave her child. Maybe she had a good reason. Odds are, she would’ve been poor like me
                        and, unless she had people like Old Gin and the Bells in her life, uneducated. Still, I like to
                        think she had a smile in her eyes and a song on her lips. I like to think she smelled of summer
                        peaches.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Back in my room, I stretch out on my bed. There is still time to show Old Gin
                        that I don’t need a husband. That I can make my own way, despite my history of dismissals.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Cautiously, I unplug the listening tube. Forbearance woofs, throwing my heart
                        into orbit. I scramble to replug the tube, but then Nathan says, “It’s just rats as I told you.
                        We could get a cat . . .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The barking stops.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan chuckles. “I didn’t think so.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell says something I can’t distinguish, hopefully not, <i
                            class="calibre7">Maybe we should investigate under the house.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If they pass that legislation, you can be sure the streetcar companies will
                        jump on it,” Nathan replies. “They’ve wanted to segregate for years.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We must pray.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It seems to me that praying is a hit-or-miss thing, and when it’s answered,
                        it’s never quite the way one expects. For a long time, I prayed my parents would come back for
                        me, but they never did. Then I outgrew my need for them, which I suppose was God’s way of giving
                        me an answer, albeit a sideways, not to mention protracted, one. I hope God will provide a swift
                        and satisfactory reply to the proposed legislation, which seems as ridiculous as putting robins
                        and blue jays in different trees and expecting them not to share the same sky.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">While Nathan works on the Sunday edition, I do my part ten feet below. I pull
                        out my dictionary, which opens to the <i class="calibre7">Y</i> section, where I’d stuck a
                        clipping of “Yea or Neigh?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Shiny bicycles with red leather seats wheel back and forth across Miss

                        the column.</p>

                            need feeding on the front end or shoveling on the back end. They don’t need exercise, a
                            stall, or blankets, and they won’t wander off if you forget to tie them up. Ladies, why
                            should men have all the fun? There is no greater thrill than that which comes from
                            captaining one’s own ship through the waters of one’s choosing. You can run your errands
                            twice as fast and exercise your limbs while doing it.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">And to those who call women who ride bicycles vulgar,</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">may your iron corsets and chastity belts not weigh you down
                            while the rest of us sail the freedom machines into the twentieth century.</i></p>

                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Miss Sweetie</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Remembering the wolf-whistling men from when I left the last letter, I fetch
                        the mystery uncle’s navy suit and linen shirt from the crates. A lone woman should not travel by
                        herself at night, but a man can go wherever, whenever. It’s a wonder more women don’t disguise
                        themselves. With a few rolls, tucks, and cinches, I persuade the clothes to keep their grip on
                        me. The Balmorals are missing. Perhaps Old Gin has managed to sell them already. I padlock my
                        face with an old scarf, then top everything off with my misfit hat, which is so confusing in
                        shape, it could be worn by a man or a woman.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The coat of undyed wool crackles when I slip it on. In the inner pocket, I
                        discover a folded paper of good quality that resists my efforts to open it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><span class="calibre30">尚</span><span class="calibre30">,</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre23"><i class="calibre7">Forgive me.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000052.jpg" alt="" class="calibre31" /></p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The Chinese characters are written in penmanship even worse than mine. 尚 means
                        “esteemed” and is also a man’s name, pronounced <i class="calibre7">Shang</i>. The signature is
                        not a Chinese character I recognize. So Shang must be the mystery uncle. It occurs to me that
                        Old Gin never mentioned his name when I asked. Was that intentional?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Moreover, could Shang be Billy Riggs’s debtor? Anything’s possible, but I doubt
                        it. Old Gin had carefully screened those who lived with us, refusing all but the most hygienic
                        and trustworthy. Someone who consorted with lowlifes like the Riggses would not have made the
                        cut to be an uncle. If you choose good bricks, Old Gin liked to say, you will not have to worry
                        about your house crumbling.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-122" class="calibre21">Well, Shang, whoever you are, we are partners in crime
                        tonight.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Wearing Shang’s clothes transforms me. Miss Sweetie
                            rather likes</span> the loose and swingy fit, and the offense of wearing men’s clothes feels
                        strangely right. I swagger down the sidewalk, wishing I had a cane to swing before me. Maybe an
                        eye patch, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I giggle, wondering whether my skull has cracked. Miss Sweetie is not a pirate,
                        though she may make waves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The streets are empty, and I almost feel disappointed no one is around to test
                        out my disguise. Definitely, my skull is cracked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Both the print shop and the house have gone dark, but the streetlamp coats the
                        path to the door with a wan yellow light. Despite my effort to step as lightly as possible, the
                        stairway groans in triplet as I ascend, then cross to the door in five steps. I give a nod of
                        appreciation to the sloped roof covering the porch, which hides me in shadow. A mail slot is
                        placed at hand level. I lift the brass flap, and the slot practically shrieks at the intrusion.
                        It didn’t do that the last time I deposited my letter. I quickly stuff the paper inside.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-123" class="calibre21">But the brass flap has trapped the sleeve of my undyed
                        coat! <i class="calibre7">Goose feathers.</i> I tug my sleeve this way and that, but the thing
                        has caught me in its jaw. Soon, another jaw begins to bark&mdash;Bear. Trying not to panic, I
                        begin to work the fabric loose, but suddenly the door swings open, pulling my arm with it. I
                        give my sleeve a solid yank, and hear it rip.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear lunges toward me but doesn’t pounce, only circles as if trying to herd me
                        forward.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Bear!” Nathan slaps his thigh twice. She hastens back to his side and quiets,
                        though her tail thumps like a landed fish. “Pardon me. But it’s rather late to be leaving
                        letters.” Nathan’s gruff voice sounds weighted by weariness. He’s still wearing his day clothes,
                        but his shirt is untucked and his sleeves are unbuttoned, as if he were about to undress. Before
                        I can flee, he adjusts the knob of an oil lamp to burn brighter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I retreat to a spot halfway between the door and the stairs, and turn my back.
                        “I’m sorry to disturb you,” I call over my shoulder. My voice comes out too girlishly high, and
                        I clear my throat loudly, trying to find a lower range.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Miss <i class="calibre7">Sweetie</i>, is it?” Nathan’s voice perks up. He is
                        holding my letter and reading the envelope where I’d written, To: Mr. Nathan Bell, From: Miss
                        Sweetie.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shrink farther into the shadows and summon a self-important madam’s voice,
                        one that sounds suspiciously like Mrs. English. “Yes. Miss Sweetie, that’s me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s a pleasure to meet you face to, er, back.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As you might recall, I’ve requested anonymity.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Don’t leave yet,” he orders, then belatedly tacks on a <i
                            class="calibre7">please</i>. “I was hoping to discuss a matter with you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A matter?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Your letters of admiration.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Letters.” His shoulders tug with the effort of restraining Bear. “People have
                        been dropping them into our mail slot all day, which is why it’s a bit cantankerous. I think the
                        springs have twisted. Sorry about your sleeve.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What do these letters say?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Wait a moment, and I’ll fetch them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before I can answer, Nathan disappears with Bear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">As much as I want to know about these letters, every moment standing here I
                        risk discovery. Passing as white is a punishable offense whose severity depends on who is duped
                        and to what degree. If it were discovered that a lowly Chinese girl dispensed courtship advice
                        to hundreds, if not thousands of Atlanta women, I would get jail time if I was lucky. If not, I
                        could get an angry mob on my heels, reminding me never to make that mistake again. I have dipped
                        my toe into too deep a pond, and now an alligator must surely be on its way up. Chinese people
                        can’t be advice columnists. I thought we could be hatters, but clearly I was wrong about that,
                        too.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre21">While I clutch my sleeves, Nathan reappears holding
                        letters tied with twine. Bear barks another greeting. “I read some of them. I wasn’t quite sure
                        if you’d . . . be back. Anyway, not all of it is admiration, but the main thing is that you
                        provoked a discussion, and that’s our motto.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I think of the drawing of a microscope that adorns the front page of every
                        issue of the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>, below which is printed, <i class="calibre7">to feed
                            public discourse that such may achieve an enlightened citizenry</i>. “I’m pleased at the
                        enthusiasm. Have you received more subscriptions?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Forty-two today, and none lost. It’s incredible. I suppose we have you to
                        thank.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> needs a hundred subscribers each week
                        until April, or fifty new subscribers for each edition, I will have to do better.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He rubs his arms. “You should come in unless you want to catch a draft. I
                        promise not to . . . look.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, it is late.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How did you get here? Do you have an escort? I don’t see anyone.” He tries to
                        peer beyond me, though I shift around, blocking his view.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes. He is not far. In fact, there he is now,” I lie, searching the empty
                        streets as if I can actually see someone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Take the letters. You might get ideas for future columns.” He holds out the
                        bundle. The familiar smells of the shop beckon me&mdash;printer’s ink, lemon oil, the charred
                        hickory used in the fireplace, and other scents I can’t identify but that taken together smell
                        like home.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Toss them here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He sizes me up, now facing him directly. “Er, will you catch them?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, I shall let them give me a black eye.” Then I could definitely wear an eye
                        patch. “Be quick about it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He tosses the bundle, and I snatch them easily.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Will you be sending regular posts? Er, not to press a thumb on you. We <i
                            class="calibre7">are</i> grateful, in case that wasn’t&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I will do my best,” I interrupt, sure he can see every dot and crease on my
                        face through my hat brim. “I’ll send the posts a day or two before publication. Is that
                        acceptable?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-125" class="calibre21">With a joyful bark, Bear breaks away from Nathan and
                        barrels toward me. “No, Bear!” I shrink away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before she reaches me, Nathan grabs the dog and wrestles her back inside. “I’m
                        sorry, she’s been quite naughty as of late.” He throws a stern look at where the dog’s eyes
                        would be.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I recover my breath. “Well, it’s late. Good night.” I begin to descend the
                        staircase.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Miss Sweetie?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pause at the last stair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How did you know Bear’s name?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I, er, I thought that’s what you called her.” Didn’t he? Or did I imagine it?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh. Of course.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My ears burn as the night swallows me up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">T<span class="calibre9">HE WEEKEND STARTS </span>off a rinse-water gray, a color
                        that does nothing for fair Atlanta, or as Mrs. English would say, “piles on the ugly.” Folks
                        move slower on Saturdays, like they’re trying to make it last longer. Even the trains at Union
                        Station move as if they haven’t quite woken up yet. I wrap my scarf tighter around my neck,
                        gritting my teeth both against the morning chill and at the stabbing memory of last night’s
                        slipup. That shall serve as my warning to limit my interactions with Nathan as much as possible.
                        Miss Sweetie must remain a lady of mystery.</p>

                        Sabbath but employs a healthy cadre of young men to run the store for him. The two-story brick
                        building spans half a block, with glass windows that showcase furniture, footwear, sewing
                        machines, and even ladies’ undergarments, as bold as petunias in a box planter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I swing open an ornately carved door, ringing the bells. The store’s central
                        furnace kisses my frozen cheeks, and I soak up the heat, my face upturned to the flock of light
                        fixtures displayed from the ceiling. Maybe one day I’ll have enough money to snag one of those
                        birds, but I’ll need to get my own ceiling first.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">On one side of the store, the head clerk demonstrates an umbrella for some
                        customers in a hearty voice that carries across the room. I start toward him, but then a
                        familiar figure stacking bottles behind a counter catches my eye. “Robby?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre21">“Morning, Jo.” Robby shines a smile at me. A clerk’s
                        apron in practical brown hangs as straight as a cupboard over his pin-striped jacket. “Looks
                        like your scarf ate you for breakfast.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I unwrap my face. “I’ve got this scarf well-trained. It won’t pull the wool
                        over my eyes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I suspect not many can do that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I thought you were back on the cart.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mr. Buxbaum hired another man but caught him snoozing on the job. He asked me
                        to fill in again until he finds a replacement.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“From where I’m standing, that clerk’s apron looks just your size.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s a shame clerks don’t come in the color brown.” He squeezes out a smile
                        and bumps a fist against the table. “Guess you heard about our latest purchase.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It is a fine bicycle,” I say half-heartedly. When the situation calls for
                        comfort as opposed to advice, I am remarkably inept. Old Gin would know what to say. The rest of
                        us struggle to find the words, whereas he just plucks the right ones out of the air, like
                        dandelion fluff.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby squares a stack of cigar boxes on the counter, and then shines up a brass
                        cash register with a rag, lean arms moving with efficient strokes. “I knew she wanted a baby, I
                        just didn’t expect it to come with pneumatic tires. The thing is, Jo, we need Noemi’s wages. A
                        deliveryman’s income ain’t enough for both of us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He folds his rag into a square. The door opens, letting in more customers.
                        Robby glances toward them, and then says, “Better give me your shopping list and your bag.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hand him my shopping bag, which I sewed myself out of a damask curtain. “I
                        need a half gallon of kerosene, soap, matches, a dozen candles, and your cheapest pair of
                        ladies’ gloves, size small. Also, what do you know about Pendergrass’s Long-Life Elixir?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mr. Buxbaum says we can’t keep it on the shelf. Let me check if there are any
                        in the stockroom.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He disappears through a doorway. I study a display case of beaded patches and
                        premade bows. Prefabricated adornment is the rage. The modern woman wants a quick and
                        inexpensive way to deck herself out. A daisy made of chicken feathers sells for three cents.
                        Banditry! All it takes is a little glue and a windy day by your local farm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The front door opens once more to the ringing of bells, and a chill seeps
                        through the worn spots in my coat. High-heeled boots clap like thunder across the floorboards.
                        The monkeys of mischief have been eavesdropping on my worries.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy Riggs saunters toward me.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Fifteen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">I feign interest in a length of silk cord, monitoring
                            Billy in a looking</span> glass. He sports a teal cutaway and vest, carrying his
                        twenty-something years with the assurance of someone who has decided the world has nothing more
                        to teach him. Old Gin told me to stay away from this man. But if I leave now, he could simply
                        follow me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The man stops to finger something at a table marked <i
                            class="calibre7">O</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">PTICS</i></span>. “The Jew
                        must be rich as rhino fat.” He must be talking to me, as the other customers are out of earshot.
                        He has a quick way of snapping his words together without opening his mouth much, the way they
                        do in the mountain areas of north Georgia. “Five whole dollars for this magnifying glass. Of
                        course, one should never confuse cost with value.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He surveys the shop through the glass. “My, my”&mdash;the glass stops, and his
                        penny eyes find mine watching him through the mirror&mdash;“this place has all sorts of
                        curiosities. A pleasure to see you again, miss.” He bows, not the courteous kind that gentlemen
                        do, but a farcical bending of the knees, one heel out, hand stirring the air with the magnifying
                        glass.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A centipede-like shiver crawls down my back, and I withdraw my gaze. Hammer
                        Foot said that not engaging is a victory in itself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We don’t get a lot of coolies here. Yet the ones that come always end up
                        scratching at my door.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I finally turn around. The man stands a hand taller than me, but mostly on
                        account of the boots. A fire grows in my belly, and some steam wants out. Miss Sweetie lifts her
                        chin. “I wouldn’t scratch at your door if it were gilded an inch deep.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre21">His head tilts to one side, and his cocky grin hardens
                        into something more menacing. “I wouldn’t be so sure. If anyone can help that old horseman, it’s
                        you.” He laughs at my stricken expression, but I can scarcely compose myself with all the
                        questions flooding my mind. By “horseman,” he couldn’t mean Old Gin, could he? But why would Old
                        Gin need help?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My nose floods with the too-sweet scent of Billy’s cologne mingled with the
                        metallic stench of corruption.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I wet my lips, which have gone dry. “What do you mean?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Information isn’t free.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby returns with my damask bag, which he sets on the counter. “What can I
                        help you with, Mr. Billy?” He looks directly at the man, and my heart clutches at his boldness.
                        There are unspoken rules in the South that govern how blacks and whites interact, including that
                        blacks do not look whites in the eye. If those rules are ever broken, there are consequences,
                        sometimes unspeakable ones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy’s eyes narrow. “So the Jew now trusts the colored with his treasury.
                        Ain’t that like letting a crow guard the night crawlers?” He laughs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It occurs to me that men are the real sauceboxes, but no one ever calls them
                        sauceboxes because they are allowed to say what they want&mdash;at least the white ones. Billy
                        jabs the magnifying glass toward the neatly arranged tonics behind Robby. “I want a bottle of
                        Pendergrass’s Long-Life Elixir.” He pronounces <i class="calibre7">elixir</i> as if he is
                        actually licking the word out of the air.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I cross to the counter and rummage through my bag, more for something to do
                        than to verify the contents. My hand comes across a glass flask with etchings.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sorry, but we’re out of Pendergrass.” Robby shows the space on the shelf where
                        they would be. “Just sold the last one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I let go of the flask and withdraw my hand from the bag.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, get more.” Billy Riggs flourishes his arms, as though for emphasis. He
                        could be a play actor if vice didn’t pay so well.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m sorry, sir. Shipment’s not due until a week from Tuesday. How about
                        Marbury’s Tonic? It’s got a good price on it, and also comes with a money-back guarantee.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sounds like you got a hearing problem. I said I wanted Pen-der-grass.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The moment turns brittle as frosted glass. Two women who have drifted closer to
                        us trade worried glances and then hurriedly exit the store.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby’s pliant mouth thins, matching the dark slashes of his eyebrows. “The
                        shipment’s not due until a week from Tuesday. And only God can make those trains come faster.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It is hard to argue with that, but Billy’s leg has begun to twitch. Hammer Foot
                        says jittery energy needs stabilizing to focus it, like an arrow needs fletching to fly
                        straight. Billy’s father, rumored to have been a crook worse than Billy, could hardly have given
                        him the fletching he needed to fly a straight path.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre21">“I don’t know about that, Robby. I heard Mr. Thomas
                        Edison’s so clever, he could make even a train fly,” I drop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby clears his throat, cutting me a warning glance. Billy’s leg stops
                        twitching, and he refocuses his sights on me. The <i class="calibre7">tsk</i> of his tongue
                        sounds like a match strike.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Shall I wrap that glass for you?” Robby’s casual tone smooths the hackles in
                        the air.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The man’s gaze drifts to my damask bag, still lying on the counter next to me,
                        and before I can say “Pendergrass,” he has snaked my bag from under my nose. “Well now, what
                        sort of shopping did you do today?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Those are mine!” Miss Sweetie’s wrathiness overtakes my tongue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy’s eyes widen, but then a grin spreads across the crook’s face. “I don’t
                        see a bill of sale.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby’s face folds into a grimace. Setting down the magnifying glass, Billy
                        withdraws my items one by one: kerosene, matches, soap, candles, gloves. “Aha!” He grips the
                        flask in a mean fist and brings it into the light. “Teeth rinse?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby crosses his arms, impatience pedaling around on his face. “We have more
                        if you’d like, sir. We could all stand to take better care of our teeth.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy sets down the flask so hard, I’m surprised it doesn’t shatter. He picks
                        up his magnifying glass again. With flair, he holds up a five-dollar bill and lets it drop onto
                        the counter, where it lies like a dead leaf. “Mind you save me a bottle of that Pendergrass from
                        your next shipment. And, Miss Kuan, come see me sometime. Offers don’t last forever.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My spleen curdles. He knows my name, which means he knows I am related to Old
                        Gin. Unless he is bluffing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We watch him swagger to the exit. Not until he has left the shop do I resume
                        breathing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby carefully wraps each of my items in newspaper. “Whatever he’s offering,
                        best leave it on the table.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Don’t worry. If I was a mouse and the world’s last hunk of cheese was sitting
                        on his table, I wouldn’t be tempted in the least.” The memory of Shang’s letter unfolds in my
                        mind. Had Shang been one of the Chinese who had scratched on his door?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Glad to see he didn’t take the fizz off you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, sir.” My hands shake as I fit my items back into my bag. “You?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, Jo, still bubbly.” He grins. “The teeth rinse is on me to celebrate your
                        new job.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you. My teeth appreciate it.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-129" class="calibre21">He fits the last of my items back into my bag. “He was in
                        here the other day, offering to ‘influence’ the horse race in favor of Mr. Buxbaum’s
                        thoroughbred, Sunday Surprise. Of course, Mr. Buxbaum refused.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“So why come back?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby grins, pulling a four-ounce green bottle from his breast pocket. “Maybe
                        because we’re the only ones who sell Pendergrass.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9"> THREAD MY </span>way back to the basement, the memory
                        of Billy Riggs soiling my mind like a dirty fingerprint. I try to wipe it clean, but only spread
                        it around further. Had he followed me to Buxbaum’s? He seemed legitimately interested in the
                        Pendergrass, but it could’ve been an act.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If he’d followed me, presumably it was to try to scare me into believing Old
                        Gin had something to do with the debt. It’s the oldest trick in the book. Create a need, and
                        sell the solution. Well, I won’t fall for it. Old Gin would never have trucked with the likes of
                        Billy or his father. I would bet all the money in our work boots on it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>

                        my holy soul, or rather the holey soles in my stockings.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After three days of toiling under Caroline, it’s a wonder my arms can do more
                        than swing. But gamely, they hang in there, like two unsold salamis in the butcher’s window. I
                        flex one of the salamis and am pleased to feel the hard ridges of my muscles. Hammer Foot would
                        be happy to know that I am keeping physically active&mdash;a strong body means a strong mind, as
                        the Chinese say. I would much prefer my capable arms over Caroline’s, which are only expected to
                        lift reins and rotate fans.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Miss Sweetie observes that the higher up on the social ladder one ascends, the
                        less one needs to master the basic skills in life. Perhaps the idea is to free up time for
                        higher pursuits, such as academics or the fine arts, though if Caroline is pursuing those, I
                        have yet to see a sign of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When our railroad watch ticks toward seven o’clock in the evening, I fill my
                        mug with barley water before cautiously unplugging the listening tube.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I brace myself for Bear’s reaction. But Bear is already barking somewhere near
                        the print shop door, where a muffled conversation is taking place, female, by the sound of it.

                        Bell’s voice comes into focus from farther away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That would be nice,” says a woman whose voice I don’t recognize.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Two pairs of footsteps cross to the house, and the print shop goes quiet. I
                        rummage under the bed and pull out my writing supplies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Er, won’t you sit down?” says Nathan. Someone else is there?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’ve missed seeing you on Sundays,” a breathy voice floats down the tube. I
                        know that voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan coughs. “Oh. Did we see each other on Sundays?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, Nathan. I always waved to you from my window.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I fumble my ink and nearly spill it on my flannel nightgown. What is <i
                            class="calibre7">Lizzie Crump</i> doing up there?</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Sixteen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">“Ah. Well, we have a deliveryman who helps us now,”
                            Nathan tells</span> Lizzie. “Er, how is your father?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He is well,” says Lizzie. “He’s running a horse-race special to encourage
                        people to spruce up their houses before the race. Buy five gallons of Crump Paint and he’ll
                        throw in a brush, free.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh. How civic-minded of him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, I’ll get to the point . . .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The point must be a few train stops away, judging by the lengthy pause that
                        follows. Bear begins whacking her tail against the wall. Come on, Bear. Put those herding skills
                        to use and drive her out of the paddock.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I read Miss Sweetie’s article about the horse race . . . ,” Lizzie says. “And,
                        well, I knew it was a sign.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A sign?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That <i class="calibre7">I</i> should ask you to the horse race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My head nearly knocks against the wall. Sure, Nathan is well-known around town
                        and very eligible, but he’s no charm biscuit. And did it have to be Lizzie? I imagine her sleepy
                        blue eyes, the curtsy of her smile, the strawberry-blond ringlets teasing out the blush in her
                        skin. She is as guileless and hard to resist as the cake hats in Mrs. English’s windows, while I
                        am a lowly shoe who spends half her life squished up against a wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When Nathan doesn’t reply, Lizzie pouts and says, “Someone has already asked
                        you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No,” Nathan replies hastily, maybe now just realizing how unenthusiastic he
                        sounds. “No.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“So it was a sign, because here I am, and there you are.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre21">“Yet . . . if it wasn’t a sign, you would still be there,
                        and I would still be here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I imagine the confusion fanning over Lizzie’s face. “So . . . is that a yes,
                        then?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It would be my pleasure to accompany you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My face is stuck in a grimace. I grab my barley water but, in my agitation,
                        misjudge the volume, and the hot liquid sloshes over my fingers. “Agh!” I cry out, dropping the
                        mug. It falls to the concrete floor with a wet crack, along with my heart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I don’t move a muscle, hoping that my extreme silence will somehow rub out the
                        noise.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh! I am looking forward to it,” says Lizzie, who seems to have not caught my
                        outburst in her excitement. “I will let you know my colors by next weekend.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan doesn’t answer. I run through at least a dozen potential reactions he
                        might be having. Perhaps he has put his finger to his lips, and now the two of them are kneeling
                        by the newly discovered ventilation grill, their faces close as they listen. Or maybe he has
                        taken a screwdriver to the vent, and she is admiring his manly physique and his adroitness with
                        tools. Being discovered by Nathan would be humiliating enough, but with Lizzie beside him, it
                        would be more than I could bear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Your . . . colors?” he says at last, sounding no closer than the last time he
                        spoke.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“So you can choose the right flowers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Er, of course.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Dare I hope he didn’t hear me?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, Nathan. You’re supposed to bring flowers to the parents of the lady you
                        are courting, reserving one for her to wear on her dress.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Uh, right.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Courting</i>. That Lizzie is pretty slick for all her
                        guilelessness, slipping in the word in a way that a gentleman could not deny without being rude.
                        The conversation thins. The visit must be ending.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pick up the broken shards of my mug and sop the spilled tea with a rag. Why
                        should it matter if Nathan goes with Lizzie? It is none of my business. Naturally, I would’ve
                        preferred not to have played a role in the matchmaking, but how was I to know?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I take a sheet of paper and manage to knock my candle clear off its base. I
                        hastily blow it out before it singes my small rug. I sink to the floor. Miss Sweetie frowns on
                        jealousy, an emotion that, like lye, tends to eat away at its container. He has to date someone,
                        eventually, someone who cannot be me under the great laws of Georgia.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre21">We all must abide by the rules, but some of us must
                        follow more than others. Robby can be a deliveryman but not a clerk. Mrs. English would never
                        have promoted me to milliner, just as Mr. Payne will never promote Old Gin to head groom. Like
                        Sweet Potato and her twisted leg, we have been born with a defect&mdash;the defect of not being
                        white. Only, unlike in Sweet Potato’s case, there is no correcting it. There is only correcting
                        the vision of those who view it as a defect, though not even a war and Reconstruction have been
                        able to do that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Miss Sweetie has gone sour.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I stretch my legs, which I can no longer feel. Too much sitting and thinking
                        creates stagnation in the brain, and stagnation leads to despair. I hop on the balls of my feet
                        and make my breathing effortless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Then I grab my pen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">THE CUSTOM-ARY</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">Not to be confused with its more common cousin, the</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">yellow-plumed canary, the custom-ary is a species whose
                            characteristics vary from bird to bird. Some knock about in their cages without reason or
                            purpose (such as the custom of knocking wood to ward off bad luck), while others exhibit
                            more sensible patterns of behavior (such as the custom of driving on the right side of the
                            road). A good number of customs cling stubbornly to their withered branches, though they
                            should’ve been set free of their cages long ago (such as the custom of wearing crinoline
                            slips).</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre23"><i class="calibre7">Finally, there are those that are more cuckoo than</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">customary. For example, the custom of women riding
                            sidesaddle when, from an anatomy standpoint, that honor should go to men. Or the custom of
                            not hiring coloreds for clerks and agents when we trust them to manage our households, even
                            to tuck our children into bed. It is time to release these customs into the wild blue yonder
                            before they push the others out of the nest, as cuckoos are known to do.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre23"><i class="calibre7">Readers, what customs would you set free?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Respectfully,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Miss Sweetie</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">There. Sometimes a point is best made by approaching it from a different angle,
                        like how Merritt and I slung the jumping fish from the river rather than catching them head-on.
                        But will the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> print something so . . . provocative? Definitely not
                        with Mr. Bell at the helm. But Nathan is different from his father. He had pushed his father to
                        print the editorial criticizing streetcar segregation. He’s not the kind of man who stands out
                        in a room, but he is the kind who stands up for his beliefs.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre21">My ears perk up at a mention of Miss Sweetie by Mrs.
                        Bell.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The bicycle article was perfect. Made me wish I were younger. I would like to
                        meet this woman.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I suck in my breath and silently implore Nathan to divest his mother of this
                        notion.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t think that’s wise,” he says after a considerable pause. “She made it
                        clear she wishes to be anonymous, and if we press her, she might quit, and she’s already working
                        for free.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I suppose you’re right. How old did you say she was?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I couldn’t tell, Mother. Her face was covered.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, what did her voice sound like?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Like a regular voice.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shall need to thrash my voice up a bit, maybe even smoke a few cigarettes
                        like Mrs. English does, chased by some meat pies and plenty of beer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Not again, Nathan. You’re a reporter. Give me a better description than that.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I press my ear closer and will my heartbeat to pipe down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“To be honest, it sounded like she was nursing a cold, phlegmy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Phlegmy?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes. Now, that’s a word that doesn’t care what anyone thinks. All those
                        letters trying to prop up the ‘leg’ in the middle.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nathan.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Without the cold, I imagine her voice would be clear and forthright like a
                        good ginger ale&mdash;the kind of voice that gives good advice.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“So she’s bossy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I wouldn’t&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why do you think she wants to be anonymous? Maybe she has a controlling
                        husband.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I imagine a glint in the woman’s gray eyes as she presses a finger to her
                        cheek.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Or maybe she has chin hairs and nose warts, and she uses a broomstick to get
                        around town,” he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I slap a hand over my mouth to keep my smile from floating up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, Nathan. You needn’t be sarcastic. Anyway, we owe her a lot. Forty-nine
                        subscriptions today alone. Advertisers are sure to follow. I hope she stays.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Forty-nine is an improvement, but it’s still not enough.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She got more letters today. <i class="calibre7">I</i> hope she has a big
                        broomstick.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9"> STEAL UP </span>to the Bells’ front door, shivering.
                        The cold seems to have crystallized into a freezing dust. It’s as if the winter dragon were
                        salting the earth liberally for its supper. Lucky Yip told me that season dragons can be
                        jealous, producing weather extremes to prevent the next season’s dragon from moving in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Through the arched windows, I can see Nathan running the press, a mesmerizing
                        operation that involves intense hand-eye-foot coordination and reams of paper. Iron blocks hang
                        from the walls, like empty picture frames, and a fire blazes in the hearth. Nathan has pushed up
                        the sleeves of a thick sweater, which obscures most of his collared shirt. His printer’s apron
                        is smeared with black ink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The mail slot has been repaired. Still, I remove my glove and knock. Tonight, I
                        shall be nimble and quick, and avoid jumping over any candlesticks that might end up burning me.
                        The door creaks open, and heat caresses my front, sweetened by the sound of Bear’s joyous yelps.
                        The dog paces from side to side, restrained by Nathan’s hand around her collar.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hello? Is it you again? Er, Miss Sweetie?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes,” I say to the street, though my scarf muffles my voice. I fumble in my
                        coat for my column.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s nice to see you’re back and, er, your back. Please come in. It is arctic
                        out there. Plus, I have more letters of admiration for you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“More? Well, I shall keep this short,” I bark with annoyance, hoping to pinch
                        more crust into my Mrs. English voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A wind so chilly it makes my teeth ache seems to slice right through me. Even
                        Nathan hisses. “How would it look if our advice columnist perished over something as foolish as
                        failing to heed common sense? No one would buy papers for sure.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I loosen the scarf from my mouth and face him. “It’s also common sense not to
                        enter the homes of strangers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ah, but there you are mistaken. We are not strangers, and this is not my home,
                        which is over there.” He jerks his chin toward the other side of the building. “If it will make
                        you feel better, I will wear a blindfold, though it will be more difficult to fetch you tea.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t need tea. I only wish&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, if you don’t need tea, then it’s perfect. I will fetch the blindfold.”
                        He disappears with Bear, while I pull lint from my mouth, trying to figure out if he is serious.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sounds of footsteps and paw scratching draw near again. To my relief,
                        Nathan is not carrying a blindfold but a sack of something bulky, which he sets by the doorway.
                        Bear sits obediently by Nathan’s side, though even sitting, she vibrates with energy. “Now then,
                        where were we?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-135" class="calibre21">I clear my throat, off balance by our repartee. Surely,
                        Nathan would not be so cheeky to someone he thought was a respectable madam. I draw myself up to
                        my haughtiest posture, just like Mrs. English when a rival milliner dropped in for a visit.
                        “Here is Thursday’s column. The contents are a slight departure from the last two. I shall wait
                        while you read it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hold out my letter but shrink back when he moves closer to take it. He stops.
                        “Er, Bear, fetch.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With a <i class="calibre7">woof</i>, she springs to life, gamely delivering my
                        letter to her master, only a little wetter than it started out. He unfolds my column and turns
                        to better use the firelight. As he reads, I study his profile, from the stubborn line of his
                        stubbled chin to his deep-set eyes, which take in more than they give away. A rather forgettable
                        nose dips in the middle as if pressed by a finger. As he reads, his usually downturned mouth
                        nudges into a smile, and I feel a strange compulsion to fit my own smile against it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Despite his grouchiness, there’s a sturdiness to Nathan, cultivated by loving
                        parents who, unwittingly or not, blessed him with a humble and principled upbringing. They
                        fletched him right, and he will probably fly far in life.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He refolds the paper, and the smile fades away. His eyebrows clench together,
                        as if he’s feeling the edges of his thought before judging its shape. “It is clever. More than
                        clever, it’s brilliant.” He shifts around in the doorway, as if puzzling out which leg he
                        prefers. “If it were my choice, I would publish it in an instant. But I will need to speak to my
                        mother about this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I understand.” I hide my disappointment in a brisk and forward manner. “I will
                        bring you an alternative in the next day or two, just in case.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you. Er, well, there is another thing.” He tugs at his collar.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Both Bear and I watch him expectantly, though only one of us is breathing.
                        Perhaps he no longer wants my services now that I’ve proven myself a rabble-rouser. A tub
                        thumper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We insist on paying you. It’s not much, a nickel an article. But Mother says
                        if we don’t pay you, we would be taking advantage of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I thought I made myself clear,” I grumble. “No payment, or I shall not write.
                        If it will make you feel better, donate the money to the orphanage.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As you wish. ‘Pedaling Us toward the Future’ was a sellout. You chose a
                        germane topic.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t know what the Germans have to do with it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He blinks, and in that fatal instant, I realize I’ve goosed up. Drat those <i
                            class="calibre7">G</i>-words.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Not Germans.” Half a grin tips his face to one side. “<i
                            class="calibre7">Germane</i>. Relevant.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-136" class="calibre21">“I know what <i class="calibre7">germane</i> means.” I
                        grind my voice to give weight to my indignation. “It is rude to correct your elders.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I only meant to&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It is also rude to argue with them. I will have my letters now.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Er, certainly.” He hefts the sack, which is large enough to hold fifteen
                        pounds of grain.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Giddy goobers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Giddy goobers?” He smiles. “I told you there were a lot. May I help you carry
                        them?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. That invites further inspection of my person, of which you have already
                        done enough inspecting for one night. I am used to carrying my own bags. Just set them down and
                        close the door.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I insist on passing them to you. They are much too heavy to lift.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before I can protest, Nathan has moved closer and is pushing his cargo toward
                        me. With an exasperated gasp, I reach for the sack, but to my horror, he doesn’t let go. We hold
                        the sack from both sides for an excruciating moment, like two farmhands relocating a hive that
                        has started to buzz. He releases the sack at the same time I do, and then we both grab it again.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’ll take it,” I insist, pulling it toward me. But the uneven weight causes me
                        to lose my grip, and I drop it. “Oh! Look what you’ve done.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I crouch to collect the bundles of letters that have spilled out between us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Forgive me,” he says, seeming to force the words through his teeth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The warmth of his energy tugs at mine, and I hastily draw away from him. Bear
                        woofs, dancing around us. “I shall take one bundle. I cannot answer them all.” Even if I did
                        manage to drag the sack back to the basement, I could not conceal all the letters from Old Gin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Of course not. I simply thought you would like to see how much you
                        are”&mdash;something causes him to freeze in place&mdash;“admired.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The cold night blows at my lips. My scarf has fallen away, giving Nathan a
                        close look at the territory south of my nose. I quickly curtain my mouth and stand, reining in
                        the pounding hooves of my heartbeat. Still kneeling, he holds out a bundle. My heart catches at
                        the earnestness of his expression, his own mouth half open in disbelief. I’m seized by yet
                        another irresistible urge to fit my lips against his. Instead, I snatch the bundle, and Miss
                        Sweetie makes an exit that is far from nimble, but certainly quick.</p>

                    <h2>Seventeen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">Dear Miss Sweetie,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">I shunned my dearest friend “Mary” by accepting the</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">invitation of a popular socialite, “Kate,” who despises
                            Mary. I had hoped that befriending Kate would open doors for me and, eventually, for Mary.
                            But now Mary will have nothing to do with me, and Kate no longer invites me to her parties.
                            How do I get my real friend back?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Sincerely,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Friend in Mourning</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">Dear Friend,</i></p>

                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">pebble without one. Lost trust takes time to rebuild. But
                            with consistency and humility, the diamond can be unearthed again.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Yours sincerely,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Miss Sweetie</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Monday muscles in like the first rooster in the ring,
                            talons out,</span> ready to draw blood. With no maid on the weekends, my chores have doubled
                        in size, while Caroline’s patience has been reduced by half.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In the library, she scratches out correspondence, her face scrunched in a
                        grimace. I untangle a basket of embroidery thread and work out which lion Miss Sweetie will
                        choose to battle next. So many lions prowl right here in this room. With debutante season
                        starting, this week promises an ever-spinning carousel of social engagements for Caroline, not
                        just whist-playing, but also pressing ferns into scrapbooks and lawn bowling. It all sounds like
                        good fun, but Caroline never seems to enjoy herself with other people, though unlike with the
                        servants, she must put on a good face. Either that or she doesn’t care for the conversations,
                        which inevitably turn toward the business of securing a husband.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-137" class="calibre21">I can’t blame her. The husband business strikes Miss
                        Sweetie as uncannily similar to the scramble that ensues during an Easter egg hunt, where the
                        egg’s only hope is to sit as prettily as possible so that it will be picked up before it spoils.
                        Like Caroline, I am in no hurry to be found, though plans are under way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Dare Miss Sweetie stick her head in the marriage lion’s mouth? It is a subject
                        that most women could relate to, especially right now. I bet it would bring in more than fifty
                        subscriptions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s wingback chair groans as she fidgets, and if paper could talk, it
                        would probably be whimpering, too, under the weight of her pen. Caroline moves through life with
                        a tight grip on the world, as if she were afraid of being shaken off. Or maybe she’s determined
                        to leave a mark on the world, the same reason she grinds her shoes into the earth or scorches
                        the air with her caustic remarks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“This paper is defective! How did this pass quality control?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What do you mean, miss?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The fibers caught a speck of something, maybe sand, or an insect.” She
                        grimaces. “The nib catches along the watermark.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What’s a watermark?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I expect her to ignore me, but instead, she holds the paper at eye level,
                        parallel to the floor. “See there?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I squint at her too-flowery penmanship. At the point that her pen left off, the
                        Payne Mills insignia, <i class="calibre7">PM</i>, is pressed into the page, only visible if
                        looked at from an angle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I never noticed it before.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Father puts it on all the premier-line stationery, though if I’d paid an ounce
                        of gold for a half ream of this, I would want my money back. It’s that Mr. Foggs. He works the
                        girls too long, till they can’t see straight.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Surely your father can do something about that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Father holds Mr. Foggs in too high estimation.” She crumples her paper and
                        lobs it into the fireplace. “Mind you, ask the mail carrier when he calls where my package is.
                        It should’ve arrived weeks ago. And snuff the fire. The smoke is giving me a headache. No, no,
                        don’t open the window. Are you stupid? I shall catch a draft!”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-138" class="calibre21">I don’t close the window right away, but let the cool air
                        soothe my vexation. Ever since my comment about the bicycle costing as much as a horse, she has
                        begun to rub off the edges of our agreement and my patience.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne’s boots make ladylike taps as she enters the library, elegantly
                        draped in cream-colored wool, and clutching a letter. Noemi follows her, bearing a tray that
                        holds a simple tea service and a small brown package. Still reading her letter, Mrs. Payne
                        lowers herself into an armchair. “How about that? The Atlanta Suffragists put in a bid to
                        sponsor a horse.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, now, did I ever forecast that,” Caroline practically sings.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi hands Caroline the package. The sleeves of Caroline’s black silk robe
                        flap like the wings on a bird of prey as she tears it open. “At last!” She plucks out a shiny
                        tin of Beetham’s Glycerine and Cucumber cream.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Ignoring her, Mrs. Payne reads, “‘Though our offer be meager, we hope you
                        accept, knowing that our sponsorship would be of symbolic importance to all women. We can run
                        the race as well as any man. We only need the opportunity.’” She turns her attention to Noemi,
                        pouring tea. “A hundred dollars puts them in the running. And you know those suffragists will
                        protest if I don’t let them put their name on a horse. What to do?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Tell them they were outbid.” Caroline applies the cream with vigorous strokes
                        to her cheeks and hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They’ll figure it out. People talk.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi offers Mrs. Payne a plate of gingersnaps. “Seems to me, you can never go
                        wrong with honesty, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s shiny face splits open. “What has possessed you to think we care for
                        your opinion?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi drops her head, and Mrs. Payne’s face becomes thoughtful. “We have always
                        valued our domestics’ opinions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s gaze slings to me, as if I were the source of the trouble.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Honesty <i class="calibre7">is</i> the best policy, especially with all eyes
                        on this race,” Mrs. Payne continues. “Though, if I give the suffragists a horse, the Atlanta
                        Belles will be in a lather. Fans will go up.” With her letter, she mimes drawing open a fan and
                        hiding her face behind it, as the ladies do when they gossip.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Proceeds from the race go to the Society for the Betterment of Women, which
                        supports orphans and widows. But the Atlanta Belles would rather parade about in their
                        petticoats than associate with the loudmouthed suffragists, even though they are working toward
                        the same cause. It is perfectly acceptable to treat women as charity, but perish the thought
                        they should be enabled to help themselves. Another lion growls in Miss Sweetie’s face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I snort a little too loudly, and I fumble the spool I am winding.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline cups her hand to her ear and leans dramatically toward the entryway.
                        “What’s that? I believe another unsolicited opinion is knocking down the door.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-139" class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne purses her lips into a quick smile. “Jo?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m sorry, ma’am. I was just remembering the time Mrs. English put two playing
                        cards on her blackjack hat, and the Anti-Gambling League threatened to boycott her. That was the
                        best-selling hat of the season. Controversy boosts sales, and think of all the poor women who
                        would benefit.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi, standing quietly beside Mrs. Payne’s chair, nods thoughtfully. “It’s why
                        people pay good money to see Tantrum, the baby-eating spider, at that Barnum’s Traveling Museum.
                        If it’s just spiders they want, they could stare at their ceilings.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I laugh, and I swear Mrs. Payne does, too. She fans herself with the letter.
                        “I’ve been curious about the Fiji mermaid myself, half monkey, half fish, though it’s all
                        fiddle-faddle, of course. Animals just can’t mix like that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline noisily gets to her feet, maybe having a baby-eating tantrum of her
                        own. “Rather like people,” she sneers, sweeping away.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">T<span class="calibre9">HE EVENING STREETCAR </span>takes its sweet time
                        arriving. A group of ladies cycles past us. Perhaps it’s my imagination, but the population of
                        safety bicycles appears to be on the upswing. I smile, remembering the clever picture Nathan
                        drew for Miss Sweetie’s column of a woman bicycling past a train. I filed a clipping in the <i
                            class="calibre7">B</i> section of my dictionary.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I am glad to see you smiling,” remarks Old Gin, wearing the curious expression
                        he gets when I play an unexpected piece in Chinese chess. “There is something different about
                        you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh? It must be the rides. Sweet Potato has grown wings on her feet.” It’s a
                        wonder that Six Paces Meadow is still standing after our searing afternoon rides across it.
                        Thankfully, Merritt’s work at the mills has kept him from intruding.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Seems so.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After today’s jag, I allowed the mare to carry me north to where the streetcar
                        tracks bend toward Piedmont Park, the site of the upcoming race. With her nose up and ears
                        forward, it was almost as though the thoroughbred in her were drawn to the sweat of her kinsmen
                        emanating from that oval shrine. If I had not drawn up on the reins, she would’ve sailed through
                        the stone pillars and past the stands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“And Miss Caroline, how are her rides?” Old Gin tacks on casually as he watches
                        a jay bully away a titmouse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But why would he ask me separately about Caroline, as if my first answer had
                        not included her? Surely he couldn’t know that we take separate paths unless he had followed us,
                        which he could not possibly do without my noticing. The longer I don’t answer, the more I hang
                        myself. “Fine, I expect.” Before he can throw me more rope, I pull out the Pendergrass’s elixir
                        from my damask bag. “Got this for you. Robby says they can’t keep it on the shelf. The
                        instructions say to drink the bottle for three days&mdash;you can see they marked the
                        lines&mdash;and when you finish, you should feel ‘strong as a horse.’” I’d decided not to tell
                        him about Billy Riggs, as he would worry, maybe even feel compelled to do all the shopping
                        himself.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre21">He skims the ingredients.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Cost fifty cents, but it comes with a money-back guarantee if it doesn’t work,
                        so we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He fills his lungs, but noting my crossed arms, his protest slips away. With a
                        sigh, he uncorks the bottle and gulps down a mouthful. “Strong as horse, hm?” He smacks his
                        lips. “Please let me know if you see a tail growing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">As the streetcar approaches, Maud Gray hobbles up, still wearing her
                        blue-and-white-striped milkmaid apron. Her cap has gone askew, and her mussed hair puffs out
                        like dandelion fluff from her dark skin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin nods to her. “Evening, Mrs. Gray.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Didn’t think I’d make it. Something spooked the cows, and they wouldn’t let
                        down till noon.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sully halts in front of our stop with a single <i class="calibre7">clang</i> of
                        his bell. It is an ominous sound, different from the <i class="calibre7">ka-klank, ka-klank</i>
                        that the children make with their eager hands, milking the clapper for every last ring. Tonight,
                        everyone seems to sit too rigidly in their seats. No one is talking, not even chatty Mrs.
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin slips into a middle row with enough space for both of us, while Mrs.
                        Gray moves to the front as usual, in order to warm her old bones by the coal heater.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“There ain’t room for you here,” says a crabby gardener whom I never liked,
                        with his eternally sunburned face caused by a too-small hat. What kind of a gardener wears a
                        one-inch brim? He shifts his lanky frame, closing off the empty space next to him. “I suggest
                        you set your pins farther back.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A ball of anger gathers in my chest. Old Gin stiffens beside me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She always sits there,” says someone, though it’s hard to tell who.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hm.” Old Gin’s usually musical utterance comes out curt and disapproving.
                        People in the front rows have begun to glare at Maud, who plucks at her shawl with her thin
                        fingers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Something cold pours through my veins, running all the way to my clammy toes.
                        It occurs to me that all the faces in the front are white. A child in the back whimpers, and his
                        mother squeezes him to her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Maud stares down at her shoes. “My hands are so stiff. I just wanted to warm
                        them.” Her husky voice has lost its bounce.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-141" class="calibre21">The gardener flips up the collar of his coat. “Well, warm
                        them in the back from now on.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sit down already,” Sully throws over his bony shoulder. “I’ve got a schedule
                        to keep.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Come sit by me, Maud,” says a young maid from the row behind us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Maud gives the coal heater a longing glance. Then, with a sigh that crumples
                        the stripes of her apron, she scoots in beside the maid.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The streetcar carries us off in our unnatural silence. I sit still as a bottle,
                        attuned to every curbed whisper, every tight glance. Atlanta has always had her rules, but
                        tonight, someone has planted a foot on her back and yanked the stays even tighter. I want to
                        talk to Old Gin, but he looks busy in his own thoughts, his pupils tracking a fence heavy with
                        snowy Cherokee roses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">At the second-to-last stop before ours, Old Gin nudges me and then points his
                        nose to the front, where a man has just unfurled the <i class="calibre7">Constitution</i>. The
                        headline reads: R<span class="calibre9">ESOLVED: </span>S<span class="calibre9">TREETCAR

                    <h2>Eighteen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">“It’s not right,” I whisper once we have reached the
                            warm shadows</span> of our basement. “The streetcars are for everyone.” I set about
                        switching on our lamps while Old Gin boils water.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“There have always been lines drawn. Lines will just get darker.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“When will it be enough?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin glances at me holding my elbows, the kerosene lamp I’ve just lit moving
                        the shadows. “In China, there are many social orders as well.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“China is not a democracy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He alights on his milking stool and unties his laces. “Sometimes, things must
                        get harder before they can change.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But why?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Pain drives progress, hm?” After removing his shoes, he takes our broom and
                        sweeps the dirt we’ve tracked in. “When I was a boy, there was a drought in my village that
                        lasted three years. Food was scarce for everyone. I remember seeing a dog wandering the streets,
                        so hungry, he bit into his own leg. It was only after he drew blood that he let go.” He works
                        the dirt into a neat pile. “Sometimes, we are so driven by our own needs, we do things that hurt
                        ourselves. But eventually, the dog must let go.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If there aren’t enough rows, the colored will have to give way, just as on the
                        sidewalks. And where are Old Gin and I supposed to sit? Somewhere in the middle once again. Old
                        Gin has always steered us away from trouble.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I rouse myself from my frozen state and fetch our rusty dustpan, holding it so
                        Old Gin can sweep in the debris. An itchiness has crept into my soul, and it’s as if my insides
                        are full of shifting debris that no broom can hope to sweep away. I wish the water would boil
                        faster. I wish the Pendergrass would work quicker. I wish the dog would release its mangy,
                        flea-bitten leg.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-142" class="calibre21">I pour tea, and my eyes catch on Shang’s letter, which I
                        had set in the catch-all basket hanging from a wall hook. “Who is Shang?” I set the letter
                        before him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His glances at the letter, lingering on the loop of the signature. “Where did
                        you get this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It was in the pocket of the coat I found in the rug.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before speaking, he presses a thumb over a pressure point in his palm, then
                        slowly lets it go. “Shang was a groom, like me. He left in search of silver in Montana, after
                        the tragedy,” he says, referring to the hanging of the gentle fieldworker who paid for the
                        Rabid-Eyes Rapist’s crime. He sighs, closing himself the way a heron collapses its neck and
                        wings after a long flight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Was Shang the man who owed money to Billy Riggs’s father?” I can’t help
                        asking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He nods.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How much did he borrow?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Much more than he could afford.” Something dark crosses his face, like a
                        crow’s shadow as it passes over land.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who sent the letter?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Many questions. Sometimes it is better not to get involved. The river travels
                        fastest&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Around the stones, yes, I know. But the river always feels the stones, no
                        matter how it travels.” My voice tightens as wounds open. “And sometimes they are sharp, yet we
                        are to pretend it doesn’t hurt, just keep our heads down as always. But how will things ever
                        change if we always act like rabbits, hiding away and being afraid?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo!” His bright face rebukes me. “We are not rabbits.” He refolds the letter
                        and slides it back to me. “Do not speak of this again.” His chest rumbles, and he retreats to
                        his corner, removing the cough like a wayward child to its nursery.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I press my sleeves to my face, caging the sob that wants out. The only person
                        who cares for me does not seem to care at all tonight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">T<span class="calibre9">HE NEXT MORNING </span>the confusion on the streetcar
                        has only grown. More protests are voiced and silenced; more people shuffle about. Some choose to
                        walk, an avenue not open to the weak or infirm. Old Gin sits beside me in the middle row, his
                        shoulder twitching, which only happens when he’s tired. I try to let go of the injuries of last
                        night; however, the mystery of Shang still pulls at me. With Old Gin’s refusal to shed light on
                        the matter, the mystery seems to double in size.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-143" class="calibre21">When we arrive at the Payne Estate, Noemi’s kitchen
                        smells of bacon and . . . sour mash? At the kitchen table, Merritt hunches over a glass of
                        something yellow. Noemi sits across from him, picking gravel from a sack of cornmeal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good morning.” She gives me a tight smile. I wonder if the new streetcar rules
                        are on her mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good morning, Mr. Merritt, Noemi.” I get busy assembling a tray.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt claps his hands over his ears. “Quit hollering.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He is the source of the sour-mash stench. Violet crescents hang under his eyes,
                        and his hair leans to one side like wheat in a breeze.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hold your nose, and throw it back,” says Noemi. “Like you did your daddy’s
                        good Scotch last night. I heard you told everyone about the first girl you were sweet on.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt groans. “What?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi drops an especially large pebble onto her pile, then gets up to stir a
                        pot of oatmeal. “Don’t worry, you didn’t mention names, only that she had raven hair and pearls
                        for teeth.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt squints at me through bloodshot eyes, then holds up the glass to me.
                        “Well then, here’s to first love.” He gulps it down with several jerks of his Adam’s apple.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt sniffs at his glass. “Smells like a sewer. What’s in it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Egg yolks, Worcestershire, and a pinch of white pepper. Pepper is power. It
                        solves a lot of problems you don’t expect it to&mdash;swelling, bruises, and hangovers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt coughs, and his empty cup strikes the table with a thud. His chest
                        heaves, and with one hand clamped over his mouth, he runs out the door to the courtyard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi shrugs. “Works every time.” She spoons oatmeal into a bowl. “Today’s
                        oatmeal and peach preserves, and that porcupine can take it or leave it. August was the last

                    <p class="calibre21">“She will send it back.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pots clang as she moves them around the stove. She sighs. “Fine. I made a ham.
                        Cut a few slices if you want.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hop to the task for both of our sakes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi wipes her fingers on her apron. “I’ve been thinking about those
                        suffragists.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What about them?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The Fifteenth was supposed to improve our lot, giving our men the vote. But
                        then the <i class="calibre7">man</i> started taking it all away. It’s like they put a plate of
                        hot biscuits in front of us, but before we get a chance to eat, they say, that’ll be five
                        dollars. And if you come up with the five dollars, they say no, no, no. You gotta tell us, if
                        you got sixteen hens and thirty-seven roosters, where is Rutherford B. Hayes buried?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-144" class="calibre21">“I don’t know about the poultry, but Rutherford B. Hayes
                        was from Ohio.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Wrong. It’s a trick question. Hayes is still alive. Point is, they make it so
                        hard. Now, if women got the vote, maybe that gives us a second wind. Adds our fists to the
                        fight. Those suffragists say the Fifteenth gives the vote to <i class="calibre7">all</i>
                        citizens, not just the men. But we got to insist on it.” She gives a pot of chowder a stir.
                        “Imagine, Jo, if women got a say, that could change the whole stew.” <i
                            class="calibre7">Bang</i> goes her spoon, punctuated by the <i class="calibre7">clang</i> of
                        a closing lid. “They’re meeting Monday night at Grace Baptist. You could come with me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I imagine the suffragists, reform-minded women of the middle class, their
                        starched skirts dragging the pavement. Women with whom I have little in common. Those who dwell
                        in shadows get along by not standing out, <i class="calibre7">not</i> by raising their fists to
                        the sky. And even if women are given the vote, Chinese will still get left behind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi steers her hopeful face toward me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It is one thing to speak under the safety of Miss Sweetie’s name. Quite another
                        to take a public stance under Jo Kuan’s. “I’ll think about it.”</p>

                    <h2>Nineteen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Old Gin must stay at the Paynes’ the next few nights,
                            citing much</span> work. Though he maintains this work concerns the horse race, I can’t help
                        taking it personally. Things have not been the same between us since our skirmish over the
                        letter. Perhaps my stand-in father expects to marry me off soon, so why bother trying to smooth
                        things between us? I hunker down in the middle row of the streetcar, too tired to walk and
                        feeling cowardly for my weakness. The stench of sewage and overworked bodies smells extra foul
                        this evening, locked in by a layer of brown clouds that float like the scum off boiled bones.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Once home, I give myself a thorough scrub with barley water. It is already
                        Wednesday, and Nathan might be wondering whether he scared Miss Sweetie away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In a fragment of looking glass that Old Gin uses for shaving, I study the lower
                        half of my face, with my pearl lip and rounded chin. Is it possible to identify someone as
                        Chinese based only on a few bits? It <i class="calibre7">was</i> dark. Well, Miss Sweetie is not
                        the sort to be intimidated. She is like an old rash that keeps coming back, each time more
                        cranky and twice as determined.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I lift my chin and put my fists on my hips. The face in the mirror loses its
                        injury, though my ache over Old Gin persists on the inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Though I want to write about the streetcar rules, the topic is even more
                        controversial than “The Custom-ary.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Only two sheets of paper remain in Old Gin’s dresser. I should’ve picked up
                        more when I was at Buxbaum’s. I peek in the fabric drawer, and to my dismay, the silk pieces
                        have conjoined and transformed into a jacket with a breast pocket. The sleeves are still
                        unfinished, though Old Gin has neatly squared the collar. Old Gin does everything with
                        precision. Why should giving away his daughter be any different?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-145" class="calibre21">I tuck it away, and my fingers brush a tiny box, the
                        second item that had belonged to Old Gin’s wife. I lift the lid, and the sweet scent of cedar
                        fills my nose. A silk padding still holds the shape of the snuff bottle that once lay there. The
                        bottle has been lost, but its top remains, a jade bead with an attached spoon for drawing out
                        the snuff. I once asked to use the box to hold ribbons, but Old Gin shook his head. “A turtle
                        shell may one day hold soup, but not before the turtle has moved out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In my chambers, a solitary spider builds her web where two walls meet the
                        ceiling. I pull my quilt around my lap, watching the spider connect two strands. She doesn’t
                        need a mate. She’ll do fine on her own.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s scowling visage appears in my mind. With her wealth, every door will
                        open for her. But maybe what she wants is not for doors to open, but for the walls to come down.
                        When one grows up with walls, it is difficult to dream of a world beyond. Who knows what
                        Caroline&mdash;what any of us&mdash;could accomplish without the constant pressure to get
                        married? Without the walls, we could be like this spider, who can go anywhere she wants.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">THE SINGULAR QUESTION: IS IT SO WRONG NOT TO</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">MARRY?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre23"><i class="calibre7">It seems to me that in the rush to the altar, few who
                            marry</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">give much thought to how they got there until it is too
                            late. And then they are stuck with a lifetime of disappointment, not to mention an
                            exponential growth of laundry. We are all well-schooled in why women supposedly should
                            marry: A husband will take care of her and secure her respectability and prestige; bearing
                            children is every woman’s divine privilege and responsibility; without marriage, society
                            would decline into barbarism.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">Yet, little thought is paid to the benefits of remaining</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">single, or at least delaying marriage. While some women are
                            spinsters simply because life has not dealt them the marriage card, I submit that many women
                            are single by choice, though it may not be obvious. It is one thing to be single and
                            miserable, and quite another to be single and content. We cluck our tongue at the former and
                            brand the latter as “off her onion.”</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sometimes Mrs. English’s clients would tell her, “A fine widow like you surely
                        deserves to remarry,” to which she would always demur, “Perhaps I shall be so lucky one day,”
                        and then turn to me and whisper, “Do I look like I deserve a kick in the teeth?” And then there
                        are women, like Miss Culpepper, who have never seemed to be interested in men.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">So what are these benefits to
                            remaining single?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre22">1) Singlets do not risk a lifetime of being shackled to a bore or,</p>
                    <p class="calibre24">worse, wondering whether she is the bore.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">2) Singlets are free to pursue whatever activities interest them, and</p>
                    <p class="calibre24">to be industrious without having to share their wealth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">3) Singlets grow more robust in constitution than married
                            women,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">having only to look after their own welfare. Furthermore,
                            with no man to “protect” her, she learns to walk with steel in her spine, and a confident
                            mind lights a dark path.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Invisible fingers stretch the golden thread of my candle to the ceiling, where
                        the spider has completed her web.</p>

                        time, exposing an ink stain that looks like a paw print. The fireplace casts a halo around his
                        thatch of hair. “Would you like to come in, or are we still strangers?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The blazing fire in their hearth beckons me forward, but I remain fixed to my
                        spot halfway between the door and the stairs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Still strangers,” I say crisply, willing my heart to pipe down. Bear is
                        nowhere to be seen. I briskly hand Nathan the column and then step back. “Please pardon the
                        delay. What did your mother think of ‘The Custom-ary’?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She agreed it was very good. But I am sorry. We are a moderate newspaper. She
                        worries that if we print something too, er, radical, they will call us carpetbaggers. We would
                        go out of business.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I understand.” I hide my disappointment in a brisk and forward manner. “Please
                        tell her not to worry. I am a seasoned professional, not some ingenue who will cry into her
                        handkerchief at the slightest rejection. If one column doesn’t serve, I move on to the next.” I
                        dust off my gloved hands with two quick movements.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre21">“Delighted to hear it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Any new subscriptions?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes. Ninety-seven!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I gasp and clap my hands. “Ninety-seven! That is swell!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“All thanks to you.” With a grand sweep of his arms, he bows low to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hear myself giggling and stop immediately. “Ahem. Well, I don’t have all
                        night. Does this column serve?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan, who has started to move his feet back and forth in a lilting gavotte,
                        abruptly straightens. “Oh, er, let me see.” When he is done, a smile skims his face. “Very
                        serviceable. Certainly puts the male pressures in perspective.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shouldn’t linger, but when the window is opened, the breeze always floats
                        through. “Which pressures are those, Mr. Bell?” I hug the undyed coat to me, rooted to the spot
                        by the certainty that I am about to learn something very intriguing about Nathan, something I
                        would never hear eavesdropping.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, er, the pressure of providing for a family.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">At least that is a nobler concern than that voiced by Merritt Payne. “Your
                        parents have given you a noble profession.” A profession that Lizzie Crump has no reservations
                        entertaining.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Noble, yes.” He bends his neck to one side, and a joint pops. “But a printer’s
                        life means late hours. Constant soot. Work that wears the fingers to the bone . . .” His eyes
                        drift back toward the print shop. I can’t help wondering if he is thinking about his mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I adjust my hat, which has scooted so far down on my forehead as to act as a
                        blinder. “Late hours. Constant soot. It sounds dreadful. If it is such a concern for you, you
                        could always prepare a disclaimer, much like the horse breeders do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His eyes crimp. “That would certainly give new meaning to the word <i
                            class="calibre7">mare-ried</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes. ‘Here comes the bridle.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He tucks his chin, hiding his grin, just as I conceal one under my scarf. But I
                        must shake myself loose of the sticky web that has trapped us both. “Mr. Bell, I seem to have
                        used up all my stationery.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Say no more. If there’s one thing we have, it’s paper. Payne Mills supplies
                        ours at a good discount. It’s one of the reasons we can afford to stay in business.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">Payne</i> Mills?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My father and Mr. Payne attended Yale together.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh.” I’m not sure which surprises me more, that Mr. Bell knows Mr. Payne or
                        the other way around. He disappears for a moment, and when he returns, he passes me a package
                        whose weight suggests a fifth ream of a hundred sheets, plus a box of envelopes. “There you go.
                        Enough for several letters and maybe a few memoirs while you’re at it.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-148" class="calibre21">“Is that a comment on my age?” I snap.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, only your experience, which of course must be vast.” He leans forward, as
                        if to catch a glimpse under my hat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I recoil so quickly, I give myself a crick in the neck. “Of course it is. Well
                        then, good night.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Before you leave, I have been doing some thinking. You see, I’d attributed
                        Bear’s poor manners to a regression in training. But she also gets excited when she encounters
                        people with whom she has developed an affection. She starts herding them, as if she wants to
                        protect them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A cold sweat makes me itch to molt my clothes and slither away. But I don’t
                        move a muscle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Is it possible that we . . . know each other?” The words fly like darts
                        looking for a mark.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It takes me a moment to recover my wits. “There are some people, when you meet
                        them, you feel as if you’ve known them all your life. And then there are people who live under
                        your nose all your life, yet you don’t know them at all. Perhaps the same is true for dogs. I
                        bid you good night.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I leave him to untangle that and stumble away. I can’t help feeling that
                        despite the layers, he has somehow managed to see right through me.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Twenty</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Salt and Pepper swirl through the front door of the
                            Payne Estate</span> like soap bubbles pushed in by a breeze, their faces glowing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt looks especially fetching in a dress of watermelon pink, her plush smile
                        brimming with pleasantries. She dips side to side as I help her remove her coat. There’s a giddy
                        energy about her that makes even her Eau de Lilac perfume bounce around in my nose. “Guess how
                        <i class="calibre7">we</i> got here?” Salt asks Caroline, who sashays down the staircase at a
                        regal pace.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Adam and Eve had too much time on their hands?” Caroline says dryly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. Bicycles!” Salt claps her gloved hands. “Miss Sweetie called them ‘freedom
                        machines,’ and they are such fun.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sneeze building in my nose screeches to a halt, like the rest of me. It
                        wasn’t just my imagination. More women are trying out the safeties.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt runs a hand down each narrow sleeve. “We ‘exercised our limbs.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I swear Caroline turns a shade of green equal to Pepper’s mossy dress. She
                        trudges to the drawing room without even waiting for her guests.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pepper sheds her coat and hands it to me. “Thank you, Jo. Remember this hat?
                        You made it for me last spring, and it’s <i class="calibre7">still</i> my favorite.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Of course, miss. I’m pleased you still like it.” The color sets off her eyes,
                        and the pheasant feather is still tight and shiny.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In the drawing room, the ladies arrange themselves around the card table, and
                        Noemi pushes out the tray.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt tugs off her riding gloves with delicate plucks of her fingers and tucks
                        them into a fashionable chatelaine bag that hangs from her waist. “It only took us two days to
                        learn the safeties. You should’ve seen all the looks we got from the boys.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre21">“There’s only one boy who should matter,” Pepper
                        chastises. “Mr. Q accepted Melly-Lee’s invitation to the horse race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline goes from moss green to shiny eggplant. I pour the lemonade as
                        unobtrusively as possible, certain I hear a gun cocking somewhere.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Somebody deal the cards while I still have a full deck,” Caroline snaps.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Pepper reaches for the cards, while Salt helps herself to an egg salad sandwich
                        from Noemi’s tray. “Oh, Noemi, you are a peach. I was hoping you’d make these today.” She lifts
                        the sandwich to her mouth, but then her arm knocks her glass. A wet <i
                            class="calibre7">clunk-crack</i> freezes everyone in place.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh! Oh, I’m sorry, I’m so clumsy.” Grabbing her napkin, Salt dabs at the
                        lemonade splashed on her dress.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline groans, and Pepper pushes away from the table. Noemi alights to the
                        kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Are you all right, Miss Saltworth?” I press a dishcloth to the spill and
                        gather glass shards into a pile. Noemi returns with a broom and pan and fresh towels.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes,” Salt says shakily. “I’m sorry, I guess I was a bit overexcited.
                        Caroline, may I borrow a dress?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline flicks her cards on the table. “Jo will show you to my chambers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Follow me, miss.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In Caroline’s room, I swing open the wardrobe, and the powdery scent of her
                        sachets wages battle with Salt’s lilac perfume. Salt selects a simple frock with bows at the
                        wrists. I help her undress. She removes her chatelaine from her wet dress and then hands the
                        dress to me. “Would you mind helping me rinse this out?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Of course, miss.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Caroline is lucky to have you.” She glances behind me, and then leans closer.
                        “But should you ever find yourself unemployed again, I do hope you’ll let me know.” She winks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">How interesting. I’m tempted to take her offer right there and then, but I
                        manage restraint. Though Salt has always treated me kindly, sometimes a known tiger in one’s
                        mountain beats an unknown tiger in the mountain next door. At least for now. “Thank you, miss, I
                        will.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">For the rest of Salt and Pepper’s visit, Caroline curbs her tongue, both in the
                        dishing-out and the dishing-in. By the time she is primping for her afternoon ride, a den of
                        lions has moved into her stomach. “Bring up the leftover sandwiches at once.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, miss.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I return to her chambers, Mrs. Payne and Caroline are having a row.
                        Caroline jumps up from her vanity, where she has been applying her skin cream, and helps herself
                        to the egg salad sandwiches, groaning as she eats. “I promised Annie I would visit. Her mama has
                        been feeling poorly.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-150" class="calibre21">“Then perhaps Annie should attend her mama instead of
                        receiving you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You told me a lady only misses appointments if she is in peril of life or
                        limb.” Caroline’s chewing slows, and her mouth smacks as if tasting what’s in it, though she
                        must have eaten Noemi’s egg salad a thousand times.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne sits very still, probably wanting to put Caroline in peril of her
                        life or limb. I’m reminded of the time I watched the family telephone, certain it was about to
                        ring. Moments later, it did. Well, far be it from me to stand in the way of a good ringing. I
                        grab Caroline’s mending basket and begin to leave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why does this sandwich taste . . . peppery?” Without warning, Caroline sneezes
                        into her sleeve, three times.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good heavens.” Mrs. Payne sniffs at the remaining sandwich. She takes a
                        cautious nibble. “I don’t taste pepper.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When Caroline emerges from her sleeve, her face is blotchy. “I feel so hot!”
                        She jumps to her feet and grabs a fan from her dressing table, waving it with such vigor that I
                        feel it from across the room. Mrs. Payne opens a window.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Shall I fetch cool water?” I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ice! Ice!” pants Caroline.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I carry Caroline’s tray downstairs and, once in the kitchen, sample the
                        sandwich myself. I don’t taste pepper either. But then my eyes fall to the tin of white pepper
                        Noemi used for Merritt’s hangover cure, right by the butter crock. <i class="calibre7">Pepper is
                            power. It solves a lot of problems you don’t expect it to.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Taking a bowl and an ice pick, I make for the cellar, which lies just outside
                        the kitchen door. An uneasiness has begun pecking at my skin. A few hundred feet toward the
                        stables, Noemi’s large straw hat moves through the herbs. Noticing me, she salutes me with a
                        carrot. I force a smile and wave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sunlight rinses the room when I lift the cellar door. The scent of turnips
                        stirs my stomach. During one unbearably hot day, Noemi joined Caroline and me down here, one of
                        the few times Noemi’s mother allowed her to join us. Caroline dared me to eat a raw turnip.
                        Noemi told me not to do it, but I, five years old, didn’t listen. The taste put me off turnips
                        forever, but more important, it taught me that Noemi could be trusted, Caroline, not.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I unwrap the blocks of Hudson River ice and chip a few pieces into my bowl.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The water in my pitcher sloshes as I ferry it and the bowl of ice up three
                        flights of stairs, passing Mrs. Payne using the telephone on the second floor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae glances up at me from the breakfast table, where she’s fanning
                        Caroline with two peacock fans. “The fire’s over here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why did you take so long?” Caroline face is red and swollen, as if she’d stuck
                        it into a beehive. “Oh, it burns! Make it stop!” She fans her face with her hands, which are
                        also inflamed.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-151" class="calibre21">I set the bowl on the table and fill it with water. Etta
                        Rae is about to dip a dishcloth into the water when Caroline dunks her entire face into the
                        bowl.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Water spills everywhere. Etta Rae puts her dishcloth to work. “Easy, Miss
                        Caroline.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline reappears, water streaming down her cheeks, turning her silk riding
                        habit from blue to black.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae clucks her tongue. “The doctor will be here soon. He’ll have an
                        ointment or some such. You’ll be fine.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I certainly will <i class="calibre7">not</i> be fine! That nigra ruined my
                        looks. She’s ruined me!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s just temporary. Like when you got the poison ivy. Jo, fetch more ice.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi’s smiling face appears in my head, and my teeth clench. I clutch at the
                        banister as I hurry downstairs, feeling suddenly unsteady on my feet. It will take more than ice
                        to soothe Caroline’s wrath.</p>

                    <p class="calibre21">I carry a basket of wet things down the stairs, but stop when I see Etta Rae
                        standing just outside the kitchen holding a vase of bluebells. She puts her finger to her lips
                        as I creep closer, professional eavesdropper that I am, and though she frowns at me, she doesn’t
                        shoo me away.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-152" class="calibre21">“No, ma’am,” Noemi says. “Celery, onion, pickles,
                        mustard, oil, vinegar, lemon juice, and salt. Like always.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What about the bread?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Potato buns ain’t got pepper.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A long pause follows, during which Etta Rae and I exchange worried expressions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Take tomorrow off,” Mrs. Payne says at last. “The weekend, too. Caroline will
                        need rest and quiet, and&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">And she will need to be convinced that Noemi has not tried to poison her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae’s usually erect head seems to sink into her thin shoulders.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I understand, ma’am,” Noemi says hoarsely.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sound of Mrs. Payne’s boots straightens our postures. Etta Rae busies
                        herself arranging the flowers on a table. I continue toward the kitchen, sidestepping Mrs. Payne
                        coming out. “Oh, Jo. I’m afraid the sight of Caroline’s face will shock her when she wakes up.
                        Find all her looking glasses and put them in my study.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am. What about her vanity?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Solomon will take care of the vanity. Etta Rae, please call for one of our
                        substitute cooks.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am.” Etta Rae heads toward the staircase.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I move toward the kitchen again with the wet laundry, wanting to talk to Noemi,
                        but Mrs. Payne blocks the doorway. “Now, Jo.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am.” With heavy feet, I follow Etta Rae.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9">N THE ROW </span>in front of me, the hackle feather of a
                        white woman’s flowerpot hat wags like a finger every time the streetcar hits a pothole. The
                        invisible line between the front and the back takes shape with every ride. Only whites sit in
                        rows one and two. Rows three through five vary, depending on the passengers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Adelle Jones was arrested yesterday for not getting up fast enough when a
                        mother with child wanted her seat,” whispers a woman from behind me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ain’t Adelle pregnant, too?” says another woman.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My mind returns to Noemi. Come on, Miss Sweetie, think. Noemi would never have
                        taken such a chance. She has too much to lose and too little to gain. Caroline’s rash must have
                        been caused by someone or something else. Spring allergies again? Maybe an insect bit her. Once,
                        a spider stung Lucky Yip on the earlobe, and his ear swelled to the size of his palm.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre21">His palm. Caroline’s palms were also inflamed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her tin of Beetham’s Glycerine and Cucumber cream appears in my mind. She
                        spread it on her face just before eating. Is she allergic to it? She’s used it without problem
                        before, but things can turn on you, like eggs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The Beetham’s had just arrived and must have been fresh. Did someone tamper
                        with it? I can think of few people who wouldn’t stick a foot in her path if given the
                        opportunity, including myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Salt. The spilt lemonade. Perhaps Caroline tasted pepper not from her sandwich
                        but her face cream. Salt’s detachable chatelaine bag surely could’ve hidden a pinch of pepper.
                        If Salt knows about Caroline and Mr. Q, she’d have every reason to despise Caroline. Maybe,
                        beneath those frothy pink layers, Salt is as cunning as a foldable sunhat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">T<span class="calibre9">HE NEXT MORNING</span>, Caroline lies in her bed,
                        orbited by a ring of pillows and holding her potted violet. Her face is no longer swollen, but
                        blisters form peer groups on her skin, including a popular crowd on her forehead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne throws open the windows. “A little powder, and no one will even
                        notice.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Moving as unobtrusively as possible, I exchange a bowl of rosemary tincture for
                        Caroline’s plant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With a scowl, she soaks her hands in the herbal remedy. “That witch did this on
                        purpose. She should be locked up, but you send her away for a <i class="calibre7">few days</i>.
                        Imagine what she’ll do if you take her back? She’ll poison me for sure, and then you won’t have
                        to worry about whether I marry, as I’ll be dead.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne pops a spoonful of medicine into her mouth. “Rest easy, dear. Jo,
                        when you get a moment, please come see me in the stables.” She breezes away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Have I done something to displease her? Perhaps I need another reminder about
                        my place in this house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline scowls. Even her blisters manage to look grumpy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hand her a towel. “Noemi didn’t do it. But I have a hunch I know who did.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She sits very still. “Pray tell.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Miss Saltworth. I think she peppered your Beetham’s.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her eyes dart to the empty spot where her vanity used to sit. “Melly-Lee? My
                        Beetham’s . . .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It is in your vanity, which, as you know, Solomon has placed in storage along
                        with all the other looking glasses. Your mother believes you might shatter one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">For once, she fails to pounce on my innuendo. “How do you know this?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-154" class="calibre21">“It’s a hunch. Noemi may not like you, but if she were to
                        even the score, it wouldn’t be by peppering your food, which is as subtle as a flying brick.
                        Especially not with a bicycle to pay off.” I let that one burrow in her ear before adding, “Not
                        even your mother believes it, which of course is why she hasn’t fired her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s eyes glaze, as if she is replaying the memory. “That goosey,
                        whey-faced sneak.” She clenches her towel into a knobby ball. “If Melly-Lee knows, surely she
                        will break things off with him. I must be ready.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes. She could ruin you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She snorts. “He would not let that happen.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A man who cheats is not the most reliable of knights.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Edward loves me.” She wiggles her hands free of the towel. “And anyway, it’s
                        none of your business.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As you say. But now that you see Noemi didn’t harm you, you can ask your
                        mother to bring her back.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why would I do that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Because it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She grimaces. As if that argument ever worked with Caroline Payne.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“And because if you don’t, I shall need to tell your mother of my suspicions
                        regarding Miss Saltworth.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You are pushing the limits of your blackmail.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I could’ve kept my thoughts to myself and let Salt take her time brining you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She purses her lips, which I hope means she concedes the point.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I suggest you get Noemi back sooner rather than later. Miss Saltworth also
                        enjoys Noemi’s cooking. In fact, I bet Noemi could tell Miss Saltworth a lot about you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She growls. But then I hear a bump. Her head rolls back against the headboard,
                        hair scattered like threshed wheat. The sharpness has left her eyes. “Stay,” she murmurs in
                        speech that has begun to thicken.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I scoot beside her and press a cool towel to her face. She blinks sluggishly at
                        me. “Jo, you used to be on my side. Remember the plums?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When we were children, a traveling salesman with a cart of instruments came
                        upon Caroline and me playing in a wooded area where we had run away for the afternoon. He gave
                        Caroline a clarinet, but when she put it to her lips, he grabbed her from behind, a wet grin
                        upon his face. She shrieked and hit him with the clarinet, while I grabbed a trumpet and clocked
                        him on the knee.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Then we fled back to the house, hand in hand. Caroline would not loosen her
                        grip until Noemi’s mother pulled us apart and stuck plums in our palms.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I remember,” I say, but she has already begun to snore.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-155" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">A<span class="calibre9">SIDE FROM THE </span>apprehensive stutter of my heart,
                        the cogs of the Payne Estate are running smoothly. Nature’s groundskeepers&mdash;the
                        chickens&mdash;scratch and fertilize the grass, while the hired groundskeepers trim branches and
                        repair fences. Squirrels run patrol over their trees.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A group of men that includes Jed Crycks and Merritt watch Johnny Fortune ride
                        the defiant Arabian across an expanse of pasture. The jockey shows Ameer his whip. “This is what
                        you’ll get next time you go lazy in the lead,” he yells, his voice high and whiny. Ameer snaps
                        at the whip.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In front of the stables, Mrs. Payne leans over the corral fence, where Sweet
                        Potato and a few other horses are kicking around a ball blown from a sheep’s bladder. There’s a
                        crane-like gracefulness to her slender figure, a breathless hovering as if she might fly away if
                        I approach too quickly. On the other side of the corral, Old Gin oils a saddle with even strokes
                        of his skinny arms.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne doesn’t acknowledge my presence. It’s as if her eyes have turned
                        inward, and instead of watching the horses, she’s watching another scene evolve in her mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I am two paces away, her gaze finally drifts to mine. In the streaky light
                        filtering through her straw bonnet, she is as hard to read as vapor, unlike Caroline, who hangs
                        her wet feelings around her. “That Sweet Potato sure has legs on her. Old Gin has done an
                        excellent job.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She lifts her petal-like cheeks to a cloud, adjusting the rim of her hat to
                        shield her eyes from the glare. “She reminds me of another filly I used to have, Savannah Joy,
                        named for the city in which she was born.” She speaks slowly, as if reading the words from a
                        faded page. “She was a beauty, just like her mama. From the sweet curve of her cheek to the nap
                        of her hair, you could see the hand of God in her shaping. Good-natured, too. A good nature can
                        make or break a horse, not just in a race, but in life.” The trace of a smile tugs at her face.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What happened to Savannah Joy?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They made me give her up.” Her fingers twist her gold ring. “I wept every
                        night for a year.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Why would Mrs. Payne’s parents make their only daughter give up a filly with
                        whom she was so smitten, especially when they were in the business of horse breeding? It makes
                        no sense. But then, trying to understand Mrs. Payne is like trying to unfold a wet newspaper,
                        impossible to do without tearing the pages.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-156" class="calibre21">We warm in the afternoon sun, watching the horses, and I
                        wonder if the reason Mrs. Payne called me out here was to tell me about her lost filly and
                        nothing more. But then she sweeps a hand in front of her as if clearing away fog and says, “How
                        are your rides with Caroline going?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Fine, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You’re not letting her out of your sight, are you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt pops into my head, the only one who could expose my lie. Has he already
                        said something?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The longer I stand here saying nothing, the more suspicious I become. “No,
                        ma’am, she’s stuck with me,” I hear myself say. “Your daughter rides as well as the comb on a
                        rooster’s head. I expect she gets that from you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I’m not sure why I lie. I owe Mrs. Payne much more than that crank. Probably
                        because I am not a snitch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne dimples prettily. “Yes, perhaps. Well, I’m glad to see you getting
                        along.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Ameer tumbles closer into view, his jockey uttering curses. With a sigh, Mrs.
                        Payne picks her way to them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin approaches, smelling of saddle soap and ruddy with the day’s efforts.
                        “Notice something different?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You’re skinnier.” He has knocked a new hole in his belt, bunching his canvas
                        trousers at his waist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He brushes that aside with a wave of his chapped hand. “No more coughing. Even
                        blew up that ball.” Sweet Potato tries to step on the sheep’s bladder, but it slips out from her
                        hoof. “Seems we don’t need that refund.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">You could take the smile from my face and hook it for the moon. “We should
                        celebrate. Tomorrow, we could take Sweet Potato to the creek. Find where the quails are nesting?
                        Or if you want to rest, we could play chess&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I will need to stay here again this weekend. I am sorry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well then, I shall keep the burrows secure&mdash;” I say, but Jed Crycks has
                        already summoned Old Gin away.</p>

                    <p class="calibre21">How many other lonely souls have taken refuge in this basement, enduring
                        horrors that put my own troubles to shame? I trace a finger along the word <i
                            class="calibre7">galaxy</i> on the wall, a word that means all the stars in the heavens. May
                        those who passed here have found their way. Like the stars, may they have claimed their own bit
                        of sky.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My letters of admiration form an uneven pile on the floor. I gather them up and
                        reread them, hoping to ground myself in the inky pleas of others. What is it about a stranger
                        that makes it easy for one to unburden oneself? Perhaps a stranger is less likely to gossip to
                        people you know or judge you based on their knowledge of you. Or perhaps it is simply comforting
                        to feel that a stranger cares to listen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Most of Miss Sweetie’s letters seek advice on love, a topic on which she is
                        apparently an expert. I opine on what to do with a suitor who prefers grunting to conversation
                        (drop him like a hot biscuit), a gold digger (same), and a woman who is a coquette (get thee a
                        cooler biscuit). May I bring a certain wide-eyed candor to the table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Hungry for biscuits, I come across a letter with no return address, which can
                        only mean the sender hopes for an answer in print.</p>

                        great contradiction of Southern society: No one minds putting colored people in the back of the
                        streetcar, so long as it’s not their colored people. Mrs. Payne would certainly have an earful
                        for anyone who forced her to sit apart from Etta Rae&mdash;not that Mrs. Payne would ever need
                        to ride a streetcar. But no wonder lines must be drawn. The farther away you stand from someone,
                        the harder it is to like them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">Dear Name Withheld,</i></p>

                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Miss Sweetie</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It may be more controversial than Nathan wants to print, but let him decide. It
                        is a sincere letter, and if readers are asking, why can’t Miss Sweetie answer? Controversy
                        sells, and this is a hot topic. Maybe we’ll even reach two thousand subscriptions before April
                        rolls around.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I begin to fetch my disguise, but Shang’s letter beckons me from its place in
                        the basket. Even inanimate objects have energy. Old Gin believes that, one day, the positive
                        energy of his wife’s snuff bottle will reunite it with its matching top, which is why he
                        wouldn’t let me use the box. Similarly, I feel sure the positive energy of the letter attracted
                        me to it, so long hidden in Shang’s clothes. The paper seems to huddle now, curled into itself
                        as if it had longed for someone to understand it, this forgotten scrap of memory and pain.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My fingers have gone damp, and I wipe them on my dress. Then I remove the
                        letter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Forgive me. </i>Why would the sender use English here? “E,”
                        as I’ve come to call the sender, as the loop looks like a lowercase <i class="calibre7">e</i>,
                        must not have been Chinese. Then again, Old Gin and I mostly use English. Sometimes, even the
                        uncles would drop English words here and there, especially those with no Chinese equivalent,
                        like <i class="calibre7">coffee</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I study the paper more carefully for clues and, remembering Caroline’s comment
                        about watermarks, hold the paper up to the lamp.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The letter nearly drops from my hand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The familiar insignia <i class="calibre7">PM</i> runs across the page, like
                        footprints on sand.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Father puts it on all the
                            premier-line stationery.</i> An ounce of gold for half a ream. Whoever sent it lived on the
                        top branch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It could be anyone. I should leave it alone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Yet, the mystery pulls at me, soft and sticky as a cobweb. Something Old Gin
                        said nags at me. When I first showed him the clothes, he said they belonged to an uncle. Then
                        when I saw him with Billy Riggs, he said the debtor left before I was born. Which means Shang
                        couldn’t have been an uncle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The inconsistencies rub together like a door and a frame that do not quite fit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Perhaps Old Gin is trying to protect me from something. But what could possibly
                        concern me about a man I never knew? I cannot help remembering how he purposely did not mention
                        the urn involved with Lucky Yip’s trip to a better home. That was an omission meant to protect a
                        child’s heart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But I am no longer a child.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Who was Shang? Someone whose history Old Gin wanted to roll up in a rug.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Was he . . . my father?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My back thuds against the wall, as if my thoughts had just butted me from
                        behind. The lamp swings too loud, each squeak stabbing my ears. I’d stopped asking about my
                        parents long ago, after getting all I could out of Old Gin; I had been left on his doorstep,
                        wrapped in chenille and sucking my finger. After all these years, could I have stumbled upon an
                        answer?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I slide down to the floor, letting the cold concrete catch me and ground me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My mind wheels back to my skirmish with Old Gin. I had just told him about the
                        stones in the river hurting, but he seemed to not care. Perhaps he did care, more than I knew.
                        Learning that Shang was my father would be a very sharp stone indeed. One he did not want in my
                        path.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A heavy breath parts my lips. Our basement has grown smaller over the years,
                        the brick shrunken and faded, the ceiling lower than I remember. Or perhaps the realities of my
                        life have grown too big and unwieldy for the walls to contain.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pull on the navy trousers, then slip on the shirt. My fingers mismatch the
                        buttons, and I have to reseed the row. The idea I could be so close to the man I’d spent a
                        lifetime wondering about puts an ache in my heart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Whoever he was, he left.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I sniff. The scent of damp soil, pungent and earthy, crowds my nose, a reminder
                        that the world will continue to spin, whether or not we are ready. Well, I must get on with it.
                        After all, most underground residents can no longer smell the soil, so what complaints do I
                        have?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre21">I emerge from my hidey-hole and soon alight on the Bells’
                        porch, wearing a grimace that does not require much effort. Bear howls almost immediately. But
                        then the yelps grow fainter. Perhaps Nathan moved her to another part of the house. The door
                        swings open.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He looks different tonight. His hair has been trimmed and smoothed back,
                        bringing out the height of his cheekbones and the rectitude of his forgettable nose. His eyes,
                        usually hidden, shine bright as a full moon, crinkled at the outside corners by years of wry
                        humor. Gone is the slubby sweater as well as the ink-stained apron. His usually crumpled
                        collared shirt hangs straight as a sail, tucked neatly into pressed trousers. The slouch is
                        gone. Instead, he holds himself as stiffly as a choirboy singing a high note.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Miss Sweetie is tongue-tied. Of course, I couldn’t be the reason for the faint
                        whiff of spruce needles I detect coming off his freshly shaven face. I suddenly remember that
                        Lizzie Crump said she would let him know her colors by this weekend. Perhaps she visited earlier
                        this evening.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nearly a hundred more subscriptions with ‘The Singular Question’! A hundred
                        more to two thousand.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You’re nearly there.” Too late, I realize my error. He blinks. “I mean, the <i
                            class="calibre7">Focus</i> used to have two thousand subscriptions, but I noticed the
                        numbers dropped off.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Right. Well, as a matter of fact, we have been trying to regain those numbers,
                        so your help has come at a most opportune time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before he starts to wonder about the coincidental timing, I pretend to hack up
                        a viscous wad of phlegm in my throat. “Here is my Sunday column, and a few replies to my letters
                        of admiration.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He takes the piles. “My, you are assiduous.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I frown with the effort of remembering what that particular word means.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">Assiduous</i>, meaning ‘hardworking.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, I know, young man,” I snap, wondering how I got caught in the same trap
                        twice. “I’ve just never been fond of words that are led by an ass.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His face tightens, as if with the effort of trying to hold something back. “Ah.
                        Then I shall assay not to assault your ears.” He opens the letter from Name Withheld. His
                        eyebrows knit together as he reads, and when he reaches the end, he refolds the letter and taps
                        it against his chin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You are not pleased.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“On the contrary. Your concern for social inequity is admirable. In fact, the
                        recent ordinance has led us to reconsider your article ‘The Custom-ary.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He rubs a hand over his cheeks, as if unaccustomed to its smoothness. “The <i
                            class="calibre7">Focus</i> has always erred on the side of restraint. But the moment that
                        means siding with injustice, then we have lost <i class="calibre7">our</i> focus. You and I will
                        never know how it feels to be judged by our race, yet we both feel a moral urge . . .”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre21">I am hardly listening as the warm ball in my stomach
                        begins to cool. At least now I know the bottom half of my face doesn’t give me away as Chinese.
                        I release my knees and elbows from their locked positions, suddenly longing for the basement,
                        which, though lonely, beats the loneliness I feel here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“ . . . a method of subversion,” Nathan is saying. “We would be foolish not to
                        use it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Speak plainly, young man. Do you want to print ‘The Custom-ary’ or not?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes. I imagine you’ll get plenty of responses. Personally, I’d like to rethink
                        the custom of fruitcake. All those nuts and fruits jumbled together gets confusing. What do you
                        think?” A smile dances around his face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I squeeze my feelings into something very small, like a walnut, and chuck it
                        behind me for some other silly squirrel to find. There are lines that others draw for us, and
                        ones we should draw for ourselves, knowing only disappointment lies on the other side.
                        Interracial marriage is forbidden. Old Gin knew an uncle who took a colored wife, but they moved
                        to a remote community outside of Atlanta, farther from society’s relentless gaze. And anyway,
                        haven’t I already decided this spider can spin her own silk?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Stuffing my hands deep into my pockets&mdash;Shang’s pockets&mdash;I begin to
                        turn away. But somewhere in my imagination, doorbells clatter. A chill lifts the hairs of my
                        neck. <i class="calibre7">We don’t get a lot of coolies here. Yet the ones that come always end

                    <p class="calibre21">A fire roars within me. If he is bullying an old man, Miss Sweetie has a thing

                    <p class="calibre21">He snorts. “What they don’t mention is that Billy Riggs is often the one
                        putting them in the barrel. He buys and trades information. He’s an opportunistic night crawler,
                        digesting dirt so as to transform it into dirt of a richer nature.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy’s mean coppery eyes flash before me. “Is he trustworthy in the business
                        sense?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As trustworthy as blackmailers come. Why do you ask?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I need information that only Mr. Riggs can provide. I have met him and know he

                    <p class="calibre21">He scowls and tucks his fists under his arms. All the brightness has left his

                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t intend to lose the deck. All I require is the barest information.”</p>

                    <p class="calibre21">An exasperated breath gusts out of him, loosening his spine. “My mother would
                        have my head if I sent you into a lion’s den.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No matter, then. I will find out another way. I simply ask for expediency.”

                        look like a fine lampshade, with its fringe on the cuffs, but I think the dress’s clean lines

                        dry track. I hurry past Collins, wondering if I am on a fool’s errand. But if he is blackmailing
                        my stand-in father, I must know.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Just before Butler, a wet patch of grass connects Decatur to a brick building
                        the size of the Paynes’ barn. The stained glass of its arched windows is mostly intact.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Despite having brooded all day over my meeting with Billy, now that the time
                        has come, all my thoughts seem to have boarded the streetcar for home. I stare at the streaked
                        varnish of the front door, its brass push plate blackened with prints. This might be a trap.
                        Billy trades in information, but what if his intentions are more . . . sinister? Who would
                        notice if a poor Chinese girl went missing? Miss Sweetie would advise making tracks for home.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shiver, trying to shake off some of my dread. It could hardly be good for
                        business to go around assaulting potential customers. I will simply need to keep my wits about
                        me. All I need are a few answers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The door swings open, and two drunks stumble out, hastened by a kick that is
                        female in origin. “Next time you try to pay with bogus coins, I’ll get you booked! Now scram!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">One of the men falls and, seeing me, crooks a dirty finger. “Look, Rufus, we
                        drank our way clear to China.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Git!” Another push by the woman’s rolling-pin arms sends the two on their way.
                        The woman adjusts her wig, which had begun to slide to one side, and cocks a bushy eyebrow at
                        me. “Help you with something?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre21">The reek of sour mash wafts through the doorway. At the
                        back of the room, a pair of ivory tusks hangs above a bar, where a half dozen men are seated.
                        “Yes. I am told Billy Riggs can be found here?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Billy Riggs?” she screeches, quieting the chatter coming from the bar. “If
                        that no-account comes here, I have an elephant gun whose double barrel would fit right up his
                        filthy nostrils.” She fists her hands into her hips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You mean, he doesn’t conduct business here?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, and if you’re the sort who conducts business with him, you ain’t welcome
                        here neither. Good day.” She strides back into her bar and the door swings shut with a <i
                            class="calibre7">whomp!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I slouch after the drunks. Was it a mistake, or did Nathan deliberately mislead
                        me?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sucking sound of the door reopening heralds a loud clamor and a <i
                            class="calibre7">woof!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before I am halfway to the street, something familiar and furry streaks past
                        me, cutting off my path. I stumble, slipping onto the wet grass. A sheepdog pants right by my
                        face, calling up <i class="calibre7">G</i>-words with every pound of her tail.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Gravity.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Grass.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Gullible.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He led me here to deceive me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Bear,” Nathan says sternly, slapping his thigh twice. Bear returns to his
                        side, bouncing in four directions at once.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Our gaze connects. If looks were sounds, his startled expression would be the
                        braking of a train for a troop of Fiji mermaids swinging through the trees. His gaze falls to my
                        mouth, maybe measuring it against the last peek. A rosy indignation blooms around my neck.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He shakes himself loose of his stare and hands me his handkerchief. “I am
                        terribly sorry.” He doesn’t sound very sorry at all. “Are you okay?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Woof!</i> The dog settles, now patient as a rook ready to
                        be played.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I wipe dog drool off my face. “I am as well as someone who has been knocked
                        upon grass soaked with the excrement of animals can be, thank you.” Even unmasked, Miss Sweetie
                        hangs on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The warmth of Nathan’s hands as he helps me up sends electric pulses through
                        me. I’m astounded by how many thoughts can fit into the space of the second it takes for me to
                        withdraw my hand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I apologize. I couldn’t send an unaccompanied lady to Billy Riggs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">So he knew all along I had no chaperone. With my cheeks ablaze, I draw myself
                        up as if there were a string attached to my crown pulling me to the sky &mdash;Hammer Foot’s
                        power stance. “Now that you have seen that I am quite capable, will you not tell me where to
                        find him?” Bear scoops up my hand with her head, asking me to pet her. Nathan combs his hand
                        through her backside.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre21">“On two conditions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A group of men saunter toward the Church, hats turning at the sight of us, but
                        offering no comment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I will come, and you must tell me why.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why <i class="calibre7">Miss Sweetie</i>?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Our petting&mdash;me on the engine, him at the caboose&mdash;becomes more
                        vigorous. Bear will be bald soon at the rate we are pawing her. Now that I have been revealed,
                        company would be nice. As for the why of things . . .</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Your family”&mdash;I begin to say, and then hastily tack on&mdash;“<i
                            class="calibre7">business</i> has helped me, over the years, understand the world. I wanted
                        to thank you in some way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He blinks. “How . . . remarkable.” The air between us thickens with unexpressed
                        words.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Straightening, he brushes the wrinkles from his coat while I pick grass off my
                        sleeves. “Well then, Miss Sweetie, to Collins Street.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The bottom branch. That sounds more like it. He offers his arm. And though my
                        own legs have done a fair job getting me down the pavement all these years, I take it.</p>

                    <h2>Twenty-four</h2>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">Dear Miss Sweetie,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">I recently purchased a straw hat off the shelf that is
                            too</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">small. How do I make it fit?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Hatless in Atlanta</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">Dear Hatless,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre7">Fire up the teakettle. Aim the steam at the inner
                            ribbon,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre24"><i class="calibre7">rotating the hat so that the steam dampens the inside brim
                            evenly. Watch your fingers! Once the hat has cooled enough, carefully fit it over your head.
                            You will have to wear the hat for at least two hours so the hat can dry in its new
                            shape.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Yours truly,</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre25"><i class="calibre7">Miss Sweetie</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">“I confess, you are not who I expected,” says Nathan
                            after a painful</span> stretch of silence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I never am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Another silence follows, during which we try not to bump into each other. Bear
                        pads on the other side of me with her tail high, the only one of us at ease.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’ve had so many questions, and now I cannot think of a single one of them.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Then silence is your best option.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who <i class="calibre7">are</i> you?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre21">“If that is how you plan to snare the ladies, you should
                        consider rewiring your trap.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He snorts. “We are well past introductions, yet I still do not know your name.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo Kuan.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We turn a corner, and a dirty carpet of an avenue unrolls before us. Nathan
                        slows to avoid a collision with a drunkard. “Welcome to Collins Street, where you can get your
                        boots dirty and your pockets clean at the same time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Vice dens huddle as if conspiring, the crooked teeth of an upper and lower jaw.
                        At the end of the street, a church stands like the final molar, so you can swill and then rinse
                        clean in two easy steps. We skirt around a group of men, black and white, throwing dice, and
                        street sellers hawking enhancement oils and sticks of black opium.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“So, where did you grow up, Miss Kuan?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Just Jo is fine.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I don’t say more, Nathan’s eyebrows become question marks. “Who are your
                        parents?” he tries again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mr. Bell, I realize as a reporter it is in your nature to get to the bottom of
                        things. But you will need to stick to questions of a more general nature.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Fair enough. Generally, who are your parents?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hide a smile and shake my head, trying not to breathe in the stench of stale
                        tobacco, human sweat, and waste.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What about questions of a highly specific nature. Like, what is your favorite
                        word?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">Hullaballoo</i>,” I lie. I would never admit to Nathan
                        that it’s actually <i class="calibre7">besotted</i>. “I like how it makes your mouth move
                        around. If I guess your favorite word, will you stop moving your mouth around?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How could you possibly guess? There are so many words.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">Quixotic</i>.” After Mr. Bell read the story of Don
                        Quixote to him, Nathan spent a whole year proclaiming everything from the way his bread crumbs
                        stuck to his shirt to the way certain flies don’t budge even when you blow at them quixotic.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How did you&mdash;?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mouth is still moving.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He quiets, though his face is still loud with disbelief. I should not arouse
                        suspicion. “It was a guess. I do read the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>, as I told you, and you
                        overuse the word.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He stops before a lavender Victorian. Up close, the paint is peeling, and the
                        gray trim appears to have once been white, a color likely to cause great disappointment in a
                        railroad city.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A leprechaun of a man with a small hill of a nose peels himself off the porch
                        post. He leers, and the cigarette pursed in his lips droops, raining down ash. While we ascend
                        the stairs, he swaggers down with a gait much wider than a man his size should take. “Enjoy that
                        pretty bit of arse,” he drops in a rough brogue, and then laughs.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-165" class="calibre21">“Enjoy . . . ?” The words catch up to Nathan. He wheels
                        around, midstep, and begins to storm back down the stairs after the leprechaun, but I grab his
                        arm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The front door has opened, revealing a middle-aged woman solidly packed into a
                        pin-striped dress. Her white skin is even paler under a thick dusting of powder. “I recognize
                        you,” she tells Nathan in a voice that sounds as scratched as old soles. “The ladies loved you
                        last time you came.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan tears his attention from the departing man, and with a flush blooming on
                        his face, he clears his throat. “Good evening, Madam Delilah. May I introduce&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo Kuan. I am here to see Billy Riggs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The madam’s bloodshot eyes slide up my lampshade dress to my face, and then
                        shrink. “Wait here.” She closes the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear’s tail swats at the porch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Come here often?” I can’t resist asking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan frowns. “I came here to investigate. Didn’t get very far.” He refocuses
                        on the door, on which I notice two carved squares, a cleaner version of the carving on the curly
                        oak.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What do the dice mean?” I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He rolls back on his heels and the floor protests. “That four-five combination
                        is a Jesse James in craps.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The outlaw?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan nods. “He was killed by a forty-five caliber pistol. Billy thinks
                        himself a better outlaw than Jesse.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Better as in more virtuous?” Despite his being a train robber and a violent
                        murderer, some considered Jesse James a folk hero who gave his plunder to the poor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan snorts. “Jesse James was as virtuous as Satan on a Sunday. ‘Better’ as
                        in more cunning.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Madam Delilah appears once again. “He will see Miss Kuan only.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But the lady requires an escort.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If she is bold enough to seek out Billy Riggs, she can handle herself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I will be fine,” I pipe up, somewhat relieved at the notion of not having to
                        expose my affairs to Nathan.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He angles himself so the woman cannot see his face, which is clouded with
                        concern. “Miss Kuan&mdash;” he says between his teeth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo, please.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo. The word <i class="calibre7">imbecilic</i> comes to mind.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As does the word <i class="calibre7">vexatious</i>. Madam, I am ready.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-166" class="calibre21">He shoots me a black look as I enter the house. Before he
                        can follow, she locks the door behind her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The parlor extends at least twenty paces, with a bar at the end. Dim lamps make
                        it hard to distinguish faces, but it is clear from the slouched postures and raucous laughter
                        that the occupants are not here to play whist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Madam Delilah leads me down a dark corridor. Maids, mostly colored, in uniforms
                        more revealing than the ones used by the Paynes’ staff, deliver trays of food and drink. Their
                        faces are closed, as if used to minding their own business. Velvet wallpaper smooths the walls
                        between doors, tight as a lady’s bodice. A laughing woman pulls a man into a room. No doubt,
                        much of Billy’s information is collected in these very halls.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The madam stops in front of a door marked with the number 9. She knocks. “Jo
                        Kuan to see you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The door opens, and I come face-to-face with a man bearing the dead expression
                        of an undertaker. He’s even dressed for death&mdash;a black frock coat with
                        gray-and-black-striped trousers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Knucks, let her in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The man steps back, and the dirty pennies of Billy Riggs’s eyes appraise me.
                        Billy is not dressed for a funeral, or a wedding, for that matter. He is not dressed at all.</p>

                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Billy Riggs is bathing. The pale mountaintops of his
                            scarred knees</span> peek out above gray suds. His auburn hair frames his face in wet
                        noodles. “Well. I guess the gilding on my door was too hard to resist.” He smirks, feeding my
                        saucy comment back to me. His gaze cuts to a single chair positioned beside the tub. “Please,
                        sit.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My eyes crawl around the curiosities lining the walls&mdash;a stuffed owl
                        missing its eyes, bottles in different sizes, and several dolls, at least their heads. An
                        expensive-looking vase painted with a grinning Buddha adorns a side table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Something inside me flares. There is little doubt in my mind that exposing
                        himself this way and in this bizarre setting is meant to intimidate me. I flex my back. If I can
                        handle the two-headed she-devil Caroline Payne, I can handle this bathing freak show. The way
                        out is forward.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-167" class="calibre21">I summon Miss Sweetie’s most irritated voice. “I prefer
                        to stand.” A quick exit might become necessary.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The undertaker henchman positions himself before the door, his hands held in
                        front of him. His left hand sports a tattoo of a horseshoe. At Mrs. English’s, women often
                        requested horseshoes on their hats as symbols of luck. He must be superstitious. On his business
                        hand, a metal band around the knuckles gleams in the light of a pulley lamp. No wonder he is
                        called Knucks. Perhaps he hopes the horseshoe on the left hand will restore some of the bad
                        fortune that might follow the harm done with his right.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy’s scrutiny intensifies. With every passing moment, his eyes pry
                        information from me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What do you want with Old Gin?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Information costs five dollars per question.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I try to keep the shock out of my eyes. Five dollars is more than a week’s
                        wages. “How shall I know if you have information I want to buy?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He gives me a sly grin. “Life is full of risks. Keeps it interesting.” The
                        water makes rhythmic slaps against the sides of the tub.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, I don’t have five dollars. But I do have something you might want.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The water stills.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I unsheathe the bottle in my pocket, which I’d filled with barley tea and
                        sealed with wax. “Pendergrass’s Long-Life Elixir.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His lips peel open, exposing a small gap between his front teeth. “Where’d you
                        get that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I bought it at Buxbaum’s before you showed up.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy snorts, and the suds shift alliances, though I try not to look. “That
                        only costs fifty cents a bottle.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“One should never confuse cost with value,” I say, an echo of his own words
                        from our last encounter. “As I recall, the next shipment isn’t due until Tuesday.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Some of the suds have scaled Billy’s face. He makes his finger into a razor and
                        shaves them off. <i class="calibre7">Fft! Fft!</i> The moment feels slick and dangerous. Maybe I
                        <i class="calibre7">have</i> miscalculated the Pendergrass’s value. Knucks’s steel eyes lock on
                        to mine, and suddenly he does not appear quite so dead after all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Someone knocks. “Water.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Knucks unlatches the door, and in steps a maid with a steaming bucket. I
                        consider fleeing while I have the chance. The maid quickly empties her vessel. I force myself to
                        stay the course. I have come this far, and there are answers in this room, just as certain as
                        there are questions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The maid leaves and Knucks resumes his guard.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-168" class="calibre21">“Very well, I will answer your question,” Billy
                        announces.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hand him the Pendergrass and quickly step back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He winks. “Bottoms up.” He works off the cork and swigs. After a thorough swish
                        and swallow, he recorks the bottle and sets it on the side table. His attention lingers a moment
                        on the Buddha vase. “Now, to answer your question, Old Gin needs to pay a debt.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“For what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Water drips off his long eyelashes when he blinks. “Questions are five dollars
                        each.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That is hardly fair. You barely answered my question, and as I told you, I
                        don’t have five dollars.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A cunning smile grips his face. “Fortunately for you, I offer several payment
                        plans. If you would like the conversation to continue, you must answer a question for every
                        answer you want from me. Easy, right?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Easy as a dime pitch, until you discover that dimes bounce. “I want no part of
                        your blackmail scheme.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">Blackmail</i> is such an unfortunate term. Personally, I
                        don’t discriminate. Black, white, red, yellow, I serve all. If there is a question you don’t
                        wish to answer, you can stop at any time, agreed?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Fine,” I say primly. “What’s your question?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who is the most important person in the world to you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Why would he want to know that? He must want to know my weaknesses, probably to
                        tuck away for further blackmail.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I fail to answer, he adds, “Be careful. I will know if you are lying.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My molars grind. He already knows of my concern for Old Gin, so I would not be
                        giving him anything new. “Old Gin. My turn. But I would like to revise my question.” I shall
                        need to extract as much information as possible from each question. Old Gin already told me that
                        Shang owes the debt, and Billy just confirmed that Old Gin is covering it for Shang. What I
                        don’t know is why. I could ask straight out if Shang is my father. But I don’t yet want him to
                        know that I don’t know. The information game is tricky as a two-headed snake. “Why did Shang
                        come to your father?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His eyebrows rise, and he nods, as if approving of my new question. “A loan of
                        twenty-five dollars, which together with interest over the years is now three hundred dollars.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A drop of condensation, or maybe perspiration, slithers down my back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Now. You were recently fired from Mrs. English’s&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A shiver picks up the hairs on my arms. “How do you know that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If that’s a question, you must wait your turn.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, it’s not a question. Disregard it.” The Buddha appears to be laughing at
                        me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I won’t warn you again. If I had answered, you would owe me.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-169" class="calibre21">My indignation drains from my face, to my soles, and into
                        the floor. I’m reminded of the dice on the front door, advertising Billy’s cunning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He peels back a tin smile. “What scares you the most?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Being boxed in,” I answer truthfully. Two can play at this game. If he wants a
                        better explanation, he will need to ask me, and that will cost him a question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His face turns strangely thoughtful, as if he understands what I mean. But what
                        could a cretin like him understand about how it feels to be a pawn on the chessboard, only
                        moving within tightly prescribed rules? Perhaps he has simply mastered the art of not taking the
                        bait.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His mocking grin returns. He shoots me with a finger pistol, crudely indicating
                        my turn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What did Shang need the money for?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A woman, as I understand.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If Shang is my father, could this woman be my mother? This is as tedious as
                        picking up bread crumbs, one by one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy’s grinning face sinks into the horizon of his bath suds, only to emerge
                        dripping but still gleeful. He rubs water from his cheeks. “Does Caroline Payne have a lover?”
                        he casually drops.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How dare you!” He must be fishing. Undoubtedly, this is the pond in which
                        Billy regularly drops a line. I could sell her out and not lose a moment’s sleep over it. But as
                        much as I dislike her, I dislike Billy Riggs more.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He hooks an arm over the tub, and water dribbles off his twitchy fingers onto
                        the floor. “I dare whenever and wherever I like is how. And since I just answered another
                        question for you, you owe me an answer. I warned you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But ‘how dare you’ is not a real question,” I sputter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Knucks stretches his fingers with loud popping sounds and Billy grins. “Knucks
                        doesn’t like coolies. Thinks they’re bad luck. If you don’t know how to follow rules, he’ll show
                        you how.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Fine.” I shrink farther into the room away from Knucks. “But . . . I’d like a
                        different question.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The lady is bold. Well, there is something else you can offer.” Abruptly,
                        Billy stands, spilling water onto the floor. There he poses as if he were John the Baptist, just
                        come up from a dunk in the River Jordan. His muscled chest is a matted rug of auburn hair. “I’ve
                        always wanted to feel a China girl’s hair.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nearly swallow my tongue. My <i class="calibre7">hair</i>? Knucks crosses his
                        arms, testing the seams of his jacket. Against the field of black, his lucky horseshoe tattoo
                        and brass knuckles seem to crouch, ready to strike.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy steps out of the bath and, God curse my eyes, there in a dripping tangle
                        of auburn, a morel mushroom and two mossy acorns peek through. He takes his time wrapping
                        himself right in front of me. “Just a touch.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre21">I force myself to breathe. If I want to find out if Shang
                        is my father, I must let this sewer rat violate my hair. I could be ruined if it were ever
                        discovered that I allowed such a thing! But ruined for whom? Few in Atlanta would take a Chinese
                        wife, and the chances that the bachelors in Augusta or in Yankee territory will get wind of this
                        are remote. Anyway, hair is dead, a mere accessory. I can always cut it off if I regret my
                        decision. I untie my bonnet. With businesslike efficiency, I unroll my braid and dangle it
                        before Billy Riggs like a noose.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He draws near. Despite the bath, a musky, feral scent clings to him. I force
                        myself to breathe again, visualizing a cool river flowing smoothly down a grassy ravine, where
                        there are no mushrooms.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Someone knocks. “Water,” says a woman’s husky voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Go away,” Billy barks. He reaches out, and then his grubby fingers are
                        dribbling across the bumpy contours of my braid. A moan slinks across his mouth. Curiously, the
                        morel has not sprouted, and it occurs to me what he might be using the Pendergrass for.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pull away my braid. “That is sufficient!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But he doesn’t let go, and we engage in a close-range tug-of-war. Suddenly, he
                        is too close, his head twisting to one side, his breath hot against my face, his mouth wet and
                        open. Without thinking, I apply the outside edge of my boot to his bare foot, using Hammer
                        Foot’s signature move. He lets go with a curse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Knucks abandons his post, his brass knuckles flashing, the horseshoe tattoo a
                        blur. I snatch the Buddha vase and toss it to him. <i class="calibre7">Do not engage an
                            adversary; feed it</i>. The man catches the vase, but fumbles it. A loud and
                        expensive-sounding <i class="calibre7">crack </i>tells me it’s not so easy to catch pottery
                        while wearing brass knuckles. I shoulder past Knucks and throw open the door, running headlong
                        into . . . Nathan?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With a growl, Bear lunges at Billy. The man recoils, yielding Bear a mouthful
                        of robe. Nathan pulls up on the leash, his face growing grimmer as he takes in the situation.
                        “What’s going on here? I shall have you arrested!” Nathan demands in a voice full of thunder and
                        wrath, a flash of fangs behind his curling lip.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How gallant, newspaper boy. But Miss Kuan sought <i class="calibre7">me</i>
                        out,” Billy says, seething. A murderous look contorts his face. “Next time, perhaps I shall pay
                        a visit to her charming hideaway.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hardly hear Bear’s barking as the word <i class="calibre7">hideaway</i>
                        echoes through me. Surely Billy couldn’t know where I live?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear tries again and again to pounce, a blur of gray fur.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The noise and the steam and the sight of Billy’s obscene figure churn my
                        innards. I shall be sick if I stay in this room any longer. I stumble toward the hallway, nearly
                        tripping on my hat. My fingers shake as I retrieve it.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-171" class="calibre21">“If I learn you have mistreated Miss Kuan, you shall be
                        hearing from me,” Nathan’s voice cuts across the din. “On the front page.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I edge past maids, the thick carpet grabbing my feet. A woman shoulders past
                        me, her hooded figure reminding me of someone. The reek of hot lilacs fills my nose. I don’t
                        catch her face, and I continue toward the exit as fast as my feet can carry me.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Twenty-six</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">“I should’ve sicced Bear on that amphibious scoundrel.
                            Taking a</span> bath? My God, you’re as pale as the page.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m quite all right.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I draw a breath of the Collins Street air, which, though putrid, is still
                        fresher than the air inside Billy Riggs’s cathouse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, you’re not. Did he hurt you? I happen to be good at fisticuffs.” He stops
                        and looks back at the Victorian for the fourth time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. I am fine.” I hold my stomach and barrel on, remembering the time Nathan
                        broke someone’s nose over the spelling of the word <i class="calibre7">potatoes</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan matches my brisk pace. “Are you in trouble? Can I do something? Is it
                        money? We know some officials.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shake my head. I cannot risk Nathan finding out about us living under his
                        house, even if he could persuade an official to care about outsiders like Old Gin and me. Then
                        again, if Billy knows where I live, the game may already be up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan was right. To win the hand, I have lost the deck.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I kick a cigar stump out of my path, and rein in my catastrophic thoughts. Old
                        Gin always says if there are troubles on the ground, then look up. The changing sky reminds us
                        that our troubles are not here to stay. Tonight’s contains a peach of a setting sun floating in
                        a dark lake. I’m reminded of his story about the son who gave the water nymph the fruit meant
                        for the bats of good fortune.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear nudges me from the side, herding me away from a broken bottle I didn’t
                        notice.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-172" class="calibre21">Old Gin said the story hadn’t ended yet. I’d guessed the
                        father’s crops die without the peach to bring the bats back, but what of the father and the son?
                        Life keeps going, doesn’t it? The only real ending is a shovel of dirt in one’s face. Until
                        then, you have to keep on planting and sowing, sowing and planting.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hardly feel Nathan tuck my hand into his arm. We clear Collins and reach Five
                        Points, the center of the Atlanta pie since even before the war, where two Creek Indian trails
                        converged. We merge into the traffic that draws a circle around a seventy-foot-high artesian
                        well, then take the point that shoots us toward the print shop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Goddamned fungus! No information can be worth that,” Nathan grouses. His voice
                        becomes pleading. “I implore you, tell me how I can help you.” The pleading drops away and anger
                        rushes in. “I’ve been itching to tie that worm into a knot.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before we reach the print shop, I stop in front of a livery supply smelling of
                        leather and hay. “Mr. Bell&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nathan.” His grimace unfolds, and the warm and steady grip of his eyes anchors
                        me in place. “I know a place that makes good beef stew. Soothes the nerves.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I want to apologize for making you perpetuate a falsehood.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Actually, it’s truly good. Nice chunks of carrots, potatoes&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I meant the Miss Sweetie column. I would understand if you no longer want
                        them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No.” He straightens the notched collar of his loose-fitting sack coat, which
                        I’ve pulled off kilter. “Of course we want them. As long as you want to keep writing them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes,” I say, a little too quickly. “I&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nathan? <i class="calibre7">Jo?</i>”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My eyes pop out. From across the street, Lizzie Crump has emerged from a
                        carriage painted cabbage green, with gold lettering that reads <i class="calibre7">C</i><span
                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">RUMP’S</i></span> <i class="calibre7">P</i><span
                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">AINTS</i></span>. The carriage driver offers his hand
                        to another woman, who must be Lizzie’s mother, judging by her similar coloring and heavy-lidded
                        eyes. Lizzie strides up to us, tailed by the older woman.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">On Lizzie’s head sits a cunning hat of magenta felt, with a streamlined saucer
                        profile. Just like on my sensible hat, the one I left unfinished in the workroom, a rooster tail
                        of feathers sprouts from the back, pinned by an eternity knot, though the knot is missing a
                        loop. Mrs. English stole the design!</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hello, Lizzie,” I manage to get out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good evening, Mrs. Crump, Lizzie.” Nathan turns his astonished eyes to me.
                        “You <i class="calibre7">know</i> each other?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo used to work at Mrs. English’s with me. She’s a first-rate milliner.”
                        Lizzie stretches the toe of one of her pointed boots, a move that strikes me as feline.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-173" class="calibre21">“Is that right?” Nathan’s eyes drift to my borrowed
                        bonnet, into which I wish I could pull my limbs and disappear, like a turtle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes,” I say weakly. “How about that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I was just coming to tell you my colors for the race, remember?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Of course. Your colors. Ah, about that. I realized that I will not make a very
                        good escort, as I will have my hands full reporting on the race. If you wanted to find another
                        escort, I would gladly step aside.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh.” Lizzie stops twisting about and bites a finger. I can almost see her
                        thoughts wiggling into place. “Well, I don’t want another escort. And anyway, I would love to
                        watch the newsman in action.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Right.” Nathan’s gaze drifts toward me, pulling Mrs. Crump’s along with it.
                        Her sharp nose sniffs, as if smelling something off, and her false smile withers like an old
                        rind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh yes, and Mrs. English has a new advertisement for you.” Lizzie pulls a slip
                        of paper from her glove and hands it to Nathan. “Business has gone through the roof. She thinks
                        it’s because of the popularity of your new agony aunt column, so she created this special number
                        called the Miss Sweetie, for the ‘independent woman.’” Lizzie tilts her head, showing off her
                        hat. “She’s selling it at the special rate of three dollars.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If there were more irony in this situation, we could build a railroad.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Do you like it, Jo? I made this one myself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">You</i> made it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her laughter floats on a breeze. “Don’t sound so shocked. I pinned it
                        beforehand like you showed me, and that helped tremendously. Mrs. English said I might make a
                        top-shelfer if I keep up the good work.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That’s wonderful.” The words drop like lead casings. I should be happy for her
                        success, but my insides feel as mealy and brown as a January apple.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Crump rakes her gaze down my fallen braid and then her spine straightens.
                        “But how does this . . . <i class="calibre7">creature</i> . . . know you, Mr. Bell?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She is a colleague.” Nathan removes his Homburg hat, causing tufts of his hair
                        to put his head in quotes, even after he runs a hand through it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A colleague?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Lizzie playfully bats her mother’s stiff arm. “Oh, Mama, she <i
                            class="calibre7">does</i> speak English.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m afraid I must be on my way,” I say with Miss Sweetie’s briskness. Not
                        engaging is a victory in itself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But we haven’t yet finished our . . . meeting,” says Nathan. Mrs. Crump’s face
                        draws into a point focused around the nose. Her daughter still wears a loose smile from my
                        compliment of her hat. Unlike Caroline, Lizzie is cut from softer jade than her mama.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre21">I dip my head toward Nathan. “We are done, Mr. Bell.” I
                        avoid his gaze, stooping to rub Bear’s sweet face between my hands. Into her silky ear, I
                        whisper, “Thanks for coming to my rescue.” Up close, I finally see her eyes, which are warm as
                        melted candle wax, just like her owner’s.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Then I hurry away, smudging myself from Nathan’s life like a rubber cube over a
                        pencil mark. I cannot go spoony over Nathan Bell. The line between us is too dark.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Anyway, Lizzie has already laid her claim, and that is how it should be. Maybe
                        my feelings for him are more brotherly than amorous anyway, just like when he was twelve and I
                        ten, and he sang “Turkey in the Straw” so many times, I nearly yelled at him to shoot the hanged
                        turkey already. I focus on those old feelings and not these new ones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>

                        around the racetrack of our spool table, going nowhere fast. A twenty-five-dollar loan for a
                        woman that he never paid back. Did this woman write the letter? Was she the reason Shang left?
                        It occurs to me I still don’t know for certain that Shang is my father. For all my efforts, I
                        seem to have gotten more questions than answers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The speaking tube, visible through the open curtain to my corner, taunts me to
                        unplug it. I keep moving. Lately, I’ve been feeling more like an intruder anyway. When I was a
                        child, the Bells filled in the spaces Old Gin could not, teaching me about the American way of
                        life, making me feel less like an outsider in my own country. But like Old Gin, one day I’ll
                        have to let them go, too. Especially Nathan.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before I carve a moat into our floor, I pull out the cigar box of silk-cord
                        odds and ends I bought from Mrs. English for a penny and then seat myself upon my flowerpot
                        chair. Maybe tying knots will soothe some of my anxiety.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>

                        with activity. It heartens me to see Robby at a counter, counting out a woman’s change. A line
                        of folks, all of them colored, wait to be rung up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The woman puts her money in her change purse. “You tell me when they invent
                        self-mopping mops, and I’ll be the first in line.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They do have them, Mrs. Weaver. They’re called cats.” He notices me. “Good
                        morning, Jo. Be right with you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sure thing, Robby.” I collect the items I need&mdash;barley, crackers, a salve
                        for my roughened hands, a bar of soap, black-eyed peas, and an ax to replace our rusted one.
                        Plus, it won’t hurt to have a reliable weapon handy. Heaven forbid I should have to use it.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-175" class="calibre21">Robby finishes with his customers, and I bring my items
                        to him. He looks around us&mdash;no one is within earshot&mdash;and then quietly says, “Those
                        Paynes are as shifty as sand. Would you believe, they asked Noemi back? Etta Rae called Pastor
                        Harkness this morning, who passed us the message in front of the whole congregation.”</p>

                    <p class="calibre21">“That safety’s pretty fun.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He throws me a look that could cut glass. “You’re in league with her. By the
                        bye, you in the market for a mop? There’s a sale today on sweepers and scrubbers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thanks, but no. You’re a natural at this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Turns out, I’m good for business. Just hope Mr. Buxbaum agrees. He’s weighing
                        whether to hire me full-time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I am happy to hear that. Maybe I’ll get to buy you some teeth rinse soon.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He nods at a colored woman in a butter-yellow bonnet inspecting fabrics. “Nice
                        to see you, Mrs. Thomson.” She nods back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He finishes packing up my items. “That all?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Actually, no.” I remove from my pocket the knots I tied last night. “I was
                        wondering if you could show these samples to Mr. Buxbaum. They’re not like the embellishments
                        you carry, but I hoped&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo, they’re good.” He holds one up. “This one looks like a butterfly.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s a falcon, and that one is for Noemi. A falcon for farsightedness.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She’s going to like that. How much you charge?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Eight cents each, if Mr. Buxbaum doesn’t mind supplying the cord.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Make it ten cents. These are worth it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thanks, Robby.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You’re welcome.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A stack of the Sunday <i class="calibre7">Focus </i>occupies a rocking chair
                        near the exit. The sight of “The Custom-ary,” all dressed up in typeface, arouses a mother’s
                        pride in me. Worry, too. If this one doesn’t go over well, people could turn on Miss Sweetie.
                        The whole paper could come tumbling down. Then the part of me that could take a bite out of the
                        world will lose its teeth. Gone like the frost when the spring dragon roars.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Twenty-seven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Noemi doesn’t show up on Monday, and the substitute
                            cook, a</span> German woman, mans the kitchen with a three-beat efficiency&mdash;three
                        pinches of salt, three taps of the egg, three bangs of the pot. I hope Noemi returns by
                        tomorrow, before I begin to waltz. I could see her tonight at the suffrage meeting, though I
                        haven’t yet decided if I will go. Certain things are simply not worth the humiliation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The day I turned thirteen and not long before Mrs. Payne dismissed me, I begged
                        for a taste of the new Coca-Colas served at Jacob’s Pharmacy that everyone was so fizzed about.
                        We’d seen colored people in the pharmacy before and figured we might have a chance as well. With
                        two whole nickels from our money boot in his pocket, Old Gin held the bar stool steady for me,
                        as I’d just begun wearing my skirts to the floor. But the soda jerk waved a rag in Old Gin’s
                        face. “No colas for coolies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A woman laughed, and then it seemed everyone was laughing at us. My face still
                        burns thinking of that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">While I dress Caroline for her afternoon ride, the first since the pepper
                        incident, I can’t help asking, “Did you catch Miss Sweetie’s last column, miss?” I have heard no
                        news over how well “The Custom-ary” has been received.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why should I waste my time? Miss Sweetie is a know-it-all. The sort I cannot
                        brook.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I must wait and see, even visit Nathan tonight if I have to. I vowed to stop
                        eavesdropping, but a visit by Miss Sweetie&mdash;well, Jo Kuan, now that I have been
                        unmasked&mdash;would be okay. This is business, after all.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-176" class="calibre21">Outside, Old Gin shuffles up between Sweet Potato and
                        Frederick. The horses’ necks turn adoringly toward him. My own heart is a sparrow’s nest of
                        emotions for the old man: love, annoyance, gratitude, and injury, threaded with worry. He could
                        look in every nook and cranny Atlanta has to offer, but it would take him years to find three
                        hundred dollars’ worth of change. His gaze meets mine, his eyes dark like printer’s ink, with
                        smudges under the eyes. He needs a rest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline scratches at a dry patch on her forehead. The red puffiness on her
                        face has mellowed into a flaky pink. “Oh, bother.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Miss, is everything all right?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Obviously not. Wait here.” She stomps back into the house, probably to rub
                        more lard into her forehead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin holds Sweet Potato steady for me. “Thank you for minding the burrows,
                        daughter. How are you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I bite my tongue, which longs to wag about the three-hundred-dollar debt. But
                        it would upset him greatly to know that I went to see Billy Riggs, and in the company of Nathan
                        Bell, too. Once trust is lost, it is a mountain of gravel to reclimb. On the other hand, what is
                        a mountain of gravel compared to the never-ending hole of debt? What we need is a solution, one
                        that cannot be found right now, with Caroline’s footsteps punching the hallway. “I am well. And
                        you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Pretty good.” Old Gin tilts his chin toward me, the way he does when he’s
                        listening for the unspoken words. I have trouble meeting his gaze, as if doing so might crack
                        the egg of my resolve and all my messy secrets will come spilling out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline emerges through the front door looking no different from when she
                        entered. Her black hat, maybe to match her mood, comes to a point in the front. Taken with her
                        gunmetalgray riding habit, her figure puts me in mind of a crow, those most cunning birds known
                        for bullying others twice their size. “Let us be off. I have an appointment to keep,” she
                        snipes, as if she wasn’t the reason for her own delay.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We have hardly made it off the property when a rider on a black stallion
                        appears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline pulls up on her rein. “Merritt!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Ameer chugs merrily toward us, his mane rising like black smoke off a
                        locomotive with every sure step. Unlike the horse, the Payne heir is not in good form. His
                        normally erect shoulders stoop as if trying to touch, and his head crooks to one side. “Good
                        afternoon, ladies. Fine day for a ride, isn’t it?” He attempts a devilish smile, but it comes
                        out as strained as the whey through a cheesecloth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why do you look so down in the mouth?” Caroline demands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I think I just had my heart flambéed.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-177" class="calibre21">Sweet Potato fidgets under me, eager to fly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What do you mean?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Doused in alcohol and set on fire.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline tosses her eyes to the canopy of the magnolia we’re standing under.
                        “By whom?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The blue-blooded Jane Bentley of Boston. She broke off our engagement.
                        Apparently she’s an admirer of that Miss Sweetie. She told me she’d rather be single than
                        chained to a bore for a lifetime.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I choke on my own saliva and begin to cough. With an impatient huff, Caroline
                        moves Frederick away from me, as if choking were infectious. “Good riddance. She had an
                        apple-juice smell about her and not in a good way. And why is everyone so stuck on this Miss
                        Sweetie?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt picks up his smile. “Why, sister, are you jealous?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You are insufferable.” Caroline kicks off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I am sorry, sir,” I tell him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Father will probably disown me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He would not want you in an unhappy marriage.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He swats at a cloud of gnats. “My father owns a paper mill. Jane’s owns a
                        lumber mill. That is two broken engagements. Miss Sweetie’s opinion might work in theory, but it
                        is hardly realistic for people like us. Marriages need not be happy as long as they are mutually
                        advantageous.” That’s his father speaking. “Plus, she wasn’t that bad.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Apparently, the same could not be said of Merritt Payne.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He rolls his wrist and bows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I set off after Caroline, wondering if a bruised ego feels the same as a broken
                        heart, and if so, does knowing the difference shorten the recovery time? Miss Sweetie doesn’t
                        worry about Merritt. The roses of wealth and good looks tied with the bud of youth open many
                        doors.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato kicks up grass and scatters the crows, bringing us even with my
                        lady in no time. Caroline seems to hardly notice us walking beside her. She keeps playing with
                        her lace collar, folding it up in the demure style, and then flipping it down for a more casual
                        look. Her hat moves from the mansions on our left to a field of long grass on our right, and
                        then into the boughs of a pine. I sense she is looking for Mr. Q. Though, of course, why would
                        he be hiding in a tree?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Has your Mr. Q inquired after you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why would he?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You missed your”&mdash;cough&mdash;“<i class="calibre7">appointments</i> with
                        him Thursday and Friday. One would think he would be concerned.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He is too discreet to call upon me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I didn’t say ‘call upon.’ But perhaps he sent you a note. Or climbed to your
                        window.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre21">I wasn’t serious with that last suggestion, but she seems
                        to consider it for a fraction of a second. “No, he did not. And your frankness is not
                        appropriate, or appreciated.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I listen to the horse hooves play a merry duet for at least five seconds.
                        “Fine. Just seems to me that if one’s sham love&mdash;Miss Saltworth&mdash;pulled a prank on
                        one’s true love&mdash;you&mdash;one would be concerned. Alarmed, even.” I am speaking
                        recklessly, but something has loosened my stays. Maybe it is the knowledge that my term here is
                        temporary, just until Old Gin finds me a husband. Or maybe it is Miss Sweetie talking. My voice
                        seems more like hers every day.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Tie your tongue, or I will do it for you,” Caroline hisses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When we finally arrive at the water trough, while Frederick drinks, she uses
                        the reflection to smooth wayward hairs and pinch her cheeks. And then she is off, treading the
                        thorny path that so many hopeful lovers have tread before.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9">NSTEAD OF </span>S<span class="calibre9">IX </span>Paces
                        Meadow, I let Sweet Potato hoof back toward Piedmont Park in North Atlanta. May at least one of
                        us go where her heart leads her today. Perhaps we can sneak a look at the action on the track.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The smell of cut grass and freshly turned soil digs up a sweet memory. Not long
                        after the Paynes fired me, Old Gin decided we should try to attend the Piedmont Exposition of
                        1887, the biggest thing to happen in Atlanta since the war. Since the event was whites-only,
                        except for workers, I put on my gray skirt and black jacket, and Old Gin wore his standard
                        groom’s attire. We carried buckets of flowers, as if we actually had somewhere to deliver them.
                        If you walk like you know where you’re going, you can fool a lot of people, especially in a
                        place with so many distractions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Cannons fired, bands played, and exhibit halls showcased Atlanta’s best, from
                        animals and farming equipment to motorized sewing machines and phonographs. I even saw President
                        Cleveland’s wife, Frances Folsom, buy an eagle carved from local manganese marble. She caught me
                        staring at her, and I plucked out one of my blooms. “May this chrysanthemum bring good luck to
                        your home.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She took the flower. “A China girl who speaks like a Southerner? I guess
                        Atlanta does have it all.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With its witch’s-hat shape, the two hundred acres of Piedmont Park, home of the
                        Gentlemen’s Driving Club, features long swaths of green cut with pathways, and surprisingly few
                        trees for a city so full of them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We approach from the west entrance, both because it is closer to the racetrack,
                        and to avoid the buildings at the main entrance where we are likely to be chased away. A
                        carriage approaches from behind, and I sit lower in the shadows of my hat.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-179" class="calibre21">Several single-horse carriages sail by, headed toward the
                        grandstand a thousand feet ahead. Beyond that stretches the mile-long track.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Off the groomed path, a colored man in a white collared shirt and grass-stained
                        trousers pushes a lawn mower in an impressively even line. A boy rakes clippings into piles
                        nearby.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The man finishes a line and stops to mop his face with a handkerchief. Seeing
                        us, he tips the brim of his boater hat. “Looking finer every day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I slow, caught off guard, until I realize he’s talking about Sweet Potato.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She whinnies, and I bring her closer. “Good afternoon. Have we met?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m Leo Porter, and that’s my son Joseph.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The boy, who must be ten or eleven, stands at attention, chest puffed out, rake
                        held straight as a bayonet beside him. His cheeks are still full of baby fat, and his cap is
                        straight enough to balance a bottle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Always nice to meet another Jo, even if it’s a Joseph. I’m Jo Kuan.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hello, miss.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You must be Old Gin’s daughter,” says the father. There’s a slight drift to
                        his right eye, so I focus on the left. “He said you were quite a horsewoman.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I learned from the best.” But what was Old Gin doing here? Maybe he took the
                        horses here for exercise through the extensive driving trails. He would’ve had to come with Jed
                        Crycks or Mr. Payne, of course. No wonder Sweet Potato is familiar with this route.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, the track’s full of practice runs and horse trading today. There’s no
                        sneaking in. You’ll have to wait till after everyone’s gone home this evening, like usual.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Like <i class="calibre7">usual</i>. Old Gin has been sneaking in here? The
                        years might’ve emboldened him, but I suddenly wonder if his attic is getting dusty. Maybe he
                        just came for the joy of the ride. At least the dirt track is smooth, unlike Six Paces, where
                        one could easily lose one’s footing at night. He certainly couldn’t have come for horse trading,
                        as there is no better horse than Sweet Potato with her good temperament and fast legs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Pretty legs like those would fetch a pretty sum, if Old Gin
                            ever wants to sell, </i>Merritt’s good-natured voice echoes in my mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Suddenly, my limbs don’t work. Is Old Gin planning to <i
                            class="calibre7">sell</i> Sweet Potato? The after-hours trips here and Old Gin’s optimism
                        shuffle into place. Maybe he was meeting with potential buyers at the Driving Club, showing her
                        off on the track. She’d certainly command a good sum, maybe even three hundred dollars. He knew
                        I’d protest if he told me. She is part of the family.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato skitters, feeling me gripping her flanks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sound of an approaching horse pulls Mr. Porter’s gaze behind me. “‘He will
                        come like a thief in the night.’”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre21">I gape as the rider tumbles by.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Porter blows out a low whistle, probably meant for the piebald, but my eyes
                        are drawn to the rider. The tail of Mr. Q’s shirt blows freely from the back of his slim-fitting
                        jacket. His sleeves are pushed up, showing the bronzed skin of his arms, which move rhythmically
                        as he trots.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Must be late for his practice run,” says Mr. Porter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Under Mr. Q’s calfskin swashbuckler, as Mrs. English called it, with its dented
                        crown and folded-up sides, a scratch runs down the smooth slope of his cheek. I bet I know whose
                        fingernail made that mark.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m sorry, I have to go.”</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Twenty-eight</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Caroline is not at the water trough, and so after
                            letting Sweet Potato</span> slake her thirst, we head for the cemetery.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It’s not hard to find her. I simply follow the rotten odor of forbidden fruit.
                        That, and the sobs echoing through the Innocenti vault. The angels keep a stiff upper lip,
                        having gotten more than they bargained for when they took this job. Beneath the heavy boughs of
                        a hemlock, Frederick stands as still as a chess piece, only moving when Sweet Potato whinnies. I
                        tie Sweet Potato to the neighboring tree.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Inside the vault, Caroline weeps over her lap on one of two stone benches. Her
                        jacket, hat, and gloves appear hastily thrown on the bench behind her, watched over by her sleek
                        violin boots. On the back wall, melted candles form shapeless blobs in an alcove. At the front,
                        a marble tomb is big enough to house an entire family of skeletons, and could not have made a
                        comfortable bed, at least not on the outside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline looks up at me, her blotchy skin wet with tears and snot. “Go away.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The stone bench cools my backside along with my temper. I try to drum up my old
                        dislike for her, but it is like sucking on a bone that has lost its flavor. Heaving and moaning,
                        Caroline spends her grief by the dollar, until her purse empties and she’s down to nickel
                        hiccups and penny whimpers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You are too high a nut for a two-timer like Mr. Q.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She squeezes her arms over her wet blouse, her face tight. “Of course, I know
                        that. The man has scant fortune, and his head is as empty as all his promises. I cannot abide a
                        stupid man even more than a stupid woman.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Then why spend tears on him?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-181" class="calibre21">“Because.” She swings her gaze back to the crypt, her
                        head jutted forward like a vulture. Her bottom lip begins to tremble. “Edward heard a rumor that
                        Mama had an affair.” Her voice tightens under the noose of hysteria. “That she had an illicit
                        daughter.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who&mdash;you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, Merritt. Of course, me! He said he could never betroth himself to me in
                        light of such a scandal.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But you don’t want to marry him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. But if word gets out, no one else will want to marry me either.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I thought you didn’t want to marry anyone.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t, but what if I decide I do?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I say you are better off without those who base marriage on such shallow
                        rock.” An image of the milk-livered Mr. Q galloping toward the racetrack after delivering such a
                        shocking blow throws sand even in my face. “Do you think he started the rumor himself?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She shakes her head. “You give him credit where none is due. He says the
                        information is reliable.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Who would have that kind of information? The memory of a hooded figure brushing
                        past me at the Riggs’s cathouse brings all other thoughts to a screeching halt. The woman
                        smelled of lilac. I was too distraught at the time to realize who she was: Melly-Lee Saltworth.
                        As they say, a pinch of salt beats a lick of sugar, and it’s true in her case&mdash;shrewd gets
                        you farther in life than sweet. Tampering with Caroline’s face cream was just the opening shot.
                        Buying information on Caroline was clever, actually, a way to fell the enemy without a public
                        battle, one that Miss Saltworth would surely have lost.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What if it’s true?” Caroline presses two soft fingers into her temples. “If
                        Papa finds out, he will disavow us.” Her eyes clamp shut, squeezing out more tears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. Mr. Payne would not leave you to ruin. You are his crown jewel. Remember
                        when he hired the Silver Saddle Militia to make sure no boys showed up to your fourteenth
                        birthday picnic?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She sniffs. “May as well have asked a bunch of foxes to guard the henhouse.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I recall it was the hens doing most of the chasing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A smile wrestles the corners of her mouth, but she shakes it off with an
                        exasperated sigh. “This is a grave situation.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nod. “Especially for them.” I jerk my chin at the crypt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">This time, she snorts, and then the snort slips into a wheeze. Then suddenly we
                        are giggling like our heads are full of soda water.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When we emerge from the tomb, I cannot say I like Caroline Payne any better.
                        Only that my perspective of her has shifted. It’s like how climbing up on a horse makes the
                        world look less threatening and gives a clearer view of the road ahead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-182" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9"> FEEL TROUBLE </span>rumbling down the street before the
                        streetcar arrives. Then again, my visit with Billy Riggs has had me feeling like there’s a tiger
                        on every corner. Old Gin discreetly passes his hand around the base of a statue of some
                        dignitary, but not finding any coins, he dusts off his hands. I haven’t had a chance to speak in
                        earnest with him in days. I hug my cloak to me, trying to work out how to broach the topic of
                        our debt. “I ran into some friends of yours today on my ride,” I begin conversationally. “Leo
                        Porter and his son.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You went to Piedmont Park?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He hooks his hands behind his back, and his eyes stop tracking the ground. I
                        blurt out, “You’re not trying to sell Sweet Potato, are you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why would I do that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“To pay debts owed.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Silence falls like a stone into water. I’m reminded of our skirmish again and
                        brace myself. “I am not selling Sweet Potato. Please trust me, hm?” The <i
                            class="calibre7">hm</i> doesn’t assure me as it usually does.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The streetcar arrives with its usual brassy clatter. When it stops before us,
                        the new sign on its flank jars me more than the clanging bell: <i class="calibre7">W</i><span
                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">HITES </i></span><i class="calibre7">O</i><span
                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">NLY,</i></span> <i class="calibre7">R</i><span
                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">OWS 1&ndash;5</i></span>. The words hardly sink in,
                        only buzz like angry bees before my eyes. Old Gin sighs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“This isn’t right.” My words drop out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">Right</i> and <i class="calibre7">wrong</i> don’t have
                        much say in these parts,” says someone in the back. “<i class="calibre7">Will</i> and <i
                            class="calibre7">can</i> are in charge.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Some of the regulars squeeze into the already packed back rows, while others
                        begin walking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A traveling salesman in the third row shifts his bulk, causing the streetcar to
                        bounce. “Well, the coloreds in Atlanta are sure fresher than the ones out in the country,” he
                        says, his voice high and amused. He cracks a sunflower seed with his teeth and spits the shell
                        onto the sidewalk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I wait for Old Gin to decide where we should sit, but he hasn’t budged from the
                        sidewalk, and his face has become pinched in the center.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sully stands up in his seat and glares at Old Gin, his conductor’s cap looking
                        like a squashed fist. “For the love of leeches, Old Gin. Bend your perpendiculars so we can go
                        home.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“There is a problem,” says Old Gin. “Rules do not cover Chinese.” I stare at
                        him in shock. Old Gin has never spoken up like that before, but there he stands, steady as a
                        lighthouse in a rough sea. “I am brown like a potato, but Jo is white as you, though easier on
                        the eyes, hm?” A few chuckle. “Bad rules create chaos.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre21">Sully looks more red than white right now. “You ain’t
                        colored. Hitch your saddle up here, old man.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The moment feels heavy with held breaths and tight with discomfiture. Most
                        people avoid our eyes, but they are all watching with their ears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin surveys the roomy first five rows, and then the last, packed close as
                        cigars. He moves up to the third row, empty of all save the traveling salesman and his bag of
                        sunflower seeds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The salesman stretches a thick hand along the back of his seat. “You ain’t
                        colored, but you ain’t white neither.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Folks in the first rows have turned around, their faces rigid, some with
                        impatience as they stare at Old Gin and me standing behind him. The crabby gardener who
                        chastised Maud Gray sweeps a leathery hand at us, his eyes jumpy like fleas. “Dogs have no need
                        for streetcars. Git.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The traveling salesman’s head draws back. With a sudden jerk, he whuffs out
                        another seed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin’s hand flies to his face. His thin shoulders cave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The salesman wheezes out a laugh. “Got him right in the eye, that’s how!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why, you grotesque lump of flesh&mdash;” I begin to sputter, but Old Gin puts
                        a hand on my arm, leading us back to the sidewalk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin lifts his gaze to meet Sully’s. I’m reminded of the time Sully’s mule
                        started walking crooked, and Old Gin found an abscess in the animal’s hoof. The men are not
                        friends, but surely seeing the same person every day for twenty years fixes them in your life in
                        some way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“This streetcar is not for us,” announces Old Gin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sully’s usually hard face loses its fight. He turns his shoulder, and it is
                        like the closing of a heavy book.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With a <i class="calibre7">clang</i> and a <i class="calibre7">giddap!</i> the
                        streetcar bumps along and out of our lives.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Anger sparks around inside me, but pride, too. By opting not to take the
                        streetcar, Old Gin has chosen not to play in a rigged game. The river’s path will be harder this
                        way. We will need to wake earlier and arrive home later. Then again, perhaps the path is easiest
                        when the heart is light.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin walks smoothly beside me, the only sign of agitation the twitching of
                        his pupils, reflecting the thoughts inside. I’m reminded of that day that we tried to get
                        Coca-Colas. While I struggled to hold in my tears, Old Gin led us out of Jacob’s Pharmacy with
                        the same quiet dignity of kings of old. His head was not bent low, or held too high, but he
                        moved with a bearing that knew its course, no matter what the world hurled at us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">There’s a lit quality to the dusky sky that makes all the angry bits inside me
                        line up. Something powerful surges through me, a feeling that has nothing to do with ambition,
                        and everything to do with principle. “I would like to join Noemi at a suffrage meeting tonight
                        at Grace Baptist,” I hear myself say. I watch Old Gin out of the corner of my eye, bracing for
                        disapproval.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-184" class="calibre21">“It does not surprise me that Miss Sweetie is a
                        suffragist.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I stop walking. A protest bubbles up, but then fizzes away. Many lies have
                        rolled off my tongue lately, and I can’t help wondering how many I can hatch before they start
                        pecking my eyes out. “How long have you known?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He shrugs. “Jed Crycks is a devoted reader.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I picture the tough, tobacco-chewing cowboy reading my column and nearly choke.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A smile alights on Old Gin’s face. “Parent always recognizes child’s voice.”

                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">The three-story white brick of Grace Baptist Church does
                            not</span> feature a cross or a bell or any of the standard-issue church symbols. However, a
                        bronze plate on the door tells you that if you are seeking God, you can find Him here. As long
                        as you can read.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A white woman with a knit cap stretched over her bread-loaf bun puts a hand
                        over her heart when she sees me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good evening, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“May I help you?” She speaks painfully slow, as if she is not sure I can
                        understand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, I’m here for the suffrage meeting.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre21">“You? I’m sorry, but they’ve already started. We don’t
                        admit latecomers.” A fingernail of a smile digs at her face. “Too distracting.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The buzz of voices behind her indicates a crowd, but she moves her stout frame
                        from side to side as if to block my view. I can’t help thinking that the least distracting part
                        of me is the late part. “I’m supposed to meet a friend here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Noemi Withers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Never heard of her. I am sorry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo? Is that you?” warbles a familiar voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bread Loaf steps aside, revealing Mrs. English, all five feet of her,
                        looking formidable in a slate-gray suit with silver buttons. On her head sits another of the
                        Miss Sweetie hats, this one in mauve with a pink-and-black rooster tail, and an eternity knot
                        tied better than Lizzie’s. I can’t help admiring not just the color combination&mdash;she has
                        always been a fashion maven&mdash;but also her business sense. What better way to advertise her
                        product than to wear it at an event filled with her target audience?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You know this girl?” asks Mrs. Bread Loaf.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, yes. Let her in.” Mrs. English pulls me into the church by the elbow. In
                        the reception hall, a few women, all white, mill about tables set with a bowl of punch and spice
                        cake. Conversation pauses while everyone gets a good look at me. “What are you doing here?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Votes for women,” I announce to everyone, but no one smiles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, but&mdash;” Noticing all the attention on us, she throws around a
                        mind-your-own-business glare. Conversation resumes, but at a more subdued tone. Her attention
                        resettles on me. “I hear you’re back with the Paynes. I am glad you have landed on your feet.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I manage a thin smile, despite the fact it was her hands that tossed me out.
                        “Nice hat,” I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She has the grace to flush. “I’d been hoping to talk to you. I can’t seem to
                        get the knot to lie flat in the back, and I was hoping you could help me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It is missing a loop.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, perhaps you can stop by the shop and do a few for me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I am rather busy.” A doorway of carved wood leads to what I assume is the
                        sanctuary. The ceiling rumbles with the sound of footsteps, and a circle of overhead candles
                        sways.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, for heaven’s sakes, let bygones be bygones. I will pay you for them, let’s
                        say, a nickel apiece. Of course, I’d supply the ribbon. I’m desperate. I got eight orders
                        tonight alone.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ladies, to your tables, please,” says Mrs. Bread Loaf, clucking about like a
                        hen gathering chicks. “We must get our banner done tonight.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-186" class="calibre21">Mrs. English still watches me with her hawkish eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I will think about whether it makes economic sense,” I tell her, and an
                        exasperated breath wings out of her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Women file upstairs to a community hall, where more ladies&mdash;about a
                        hundred in all&mdash;are sewing. Some embroider squares of marigold fabric at worktables. Others
                        simply whipstitch strips of the same marigold fabric, creating what look to be sashes. A woman
                        in a mutton-sleeve dress jabs a finger at a sketch pinned on a wall, her face animated as she
                        gives orders. She must be the top hat in this shop. The words <i class="calibre7">V</i><span
                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">OTES FOR </i></span><i class="calibre7">W</i><span
                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">OMEN&mdash;</i></span><i class="calibre7">R</i><span

                            class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">QUALITY!</i></span> span the length of the sketch with
                        a racehorse underneath. So, Mrs. Payne accepted their bid after all.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The top hat notices me and her eyes sharpen. She brushes off a woman trying to
                        get her attention and marches over, hands fisted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. English does not notice the storm cloud on the horizon. “There’s Lizzie.”
                        My former coworker sits at the largest table, her tongue sticking out of her mouth as she
                        attempts to thread a needle. “Our table is full, but I’m sure you’ll find a place.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who is this, Mrs. English?” The top hat has a teapot face, with cheeks that
                        are starting to droop above a doily of a collar, and a nose that tips up at the end. A nervous
                        energy surrounds her, like the teapot is kept at a high simmer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. English’s vast bosom grows twitchy. “Oh, Mrs. Bullis, may I present Jo
                        Kuan. Jo, Mrs. Bullis is the president of the Atlanta Suffragists.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How unusual. I didn’t know Chinese could even be citizens. Why are you here?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Same reason as everyone else, I expect, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She sniffs. “There are many who try to pin their causes onto ours, but we are
                        here for one reason only, and that is to advance the cause of <i class="calibre7">American</i>
                        women. I find it hard to believe someone who is not an American woman can help in that effort.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My teeth clamp around the retort that springs to my lips. I fold my hands in
                        front of me and plant my feet. “You must be thrilled that your bid to sponsor a horse was
                        accepted for the race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her black pupils look like pinpricks. “Yes, of course we are.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Being matched with a fighting pair, like the Paynes’ new Arabian and their New
                        York jockey, would certainly advance your cause, maybe lead to national recognition, wouldn’t
                        you say?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It is a random draw, but yes, we are hoping for the best pair. Your point is?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Neither the jockey nor the racehorse is an American woman.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her face seems to crack a little at the jawline. Mrs. English dabs a
                        handkerchief to her brow, maybe congratulating herself on ridding herself of me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre21">Before the teapot begins spouting, I incline my head. “I
                        am only here to help where I may, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She huffs and spins around, chasing away the looks that have gathered at her
                        back. “There’s a place for you over there.” She points to a spot in the corner, where I’m
                        heartened to see Noemi, writing at a table, alongside two other ladies, the only other colored
                        people in the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bullis sweeps away, and Mrs. English escapes to Lizzie’s group.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">As I make my way to Noemi’s table, I catch snippets of conversation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“&mdash;the custom of wearing black for mourning. It washes out the
                        complexion.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My ears perk, and my feet slow as I try to unravel the conversations.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“&mdash;baseball. I can throw better than some of our local Firecrackers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“&mdash;saving one’s best gloves for parties.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A young woman with sausage curls pokes the lady beside her. “I would give up my
                        best gloves to find out who this Miss Sweetie is. I think it’s Emma Payne.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her table erupts in gasps and squeals, and a smile blooms on my face. Seems as
                        though “The Custom-ary” has worked its magic for the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi grabs me by the elbows. “You made it.” She’s pinned the falcon knot I
                        made to her hat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Looks good there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She bends her iron eyes to me. “I named it Farney.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why Farney?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Because August was already taken. Mr. Buxbaum liked your knots. He says he’ll
                        take a hundred at ten cents apiece if it’s exclusive. Imagine, Jo, that’s some good egg money.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Twice as much as what Mrs. English is offering. Visions of hanging up my own
                        little shingle on Madison Avenue dance across my vision. Would the fine ladies of New York like
                        my knots? Perhaps I can tie and advise at the same time. My sign could read <i
                            class="calibre7">J</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">O </i></span><i

                            class="calibre7">K</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">NOTS</i></span>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Come, I’ll introduce you.” She pulls me toward her table. “You have trouble
                        getting through the door?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A little. You?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She snorts. “I would’ve, if I hadn’t come with Atlanta’s best seamstress. Meet
                        Mary Harper. She works for Mrs. Bullis.” She throws a glance to the top hat, who is back to
                        barking orders.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hello, I’m Jo Kuan.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mary doesn’t smile at me, but nods, her large eyes bright and curious. Her
                        needle whips in and out of a wide swath of marigold cloth, already stitched with trees and
                        flowers. Beside her, a pointy-chinned young woman with a bright handkerchief wrapping her hair
                        gives me a look full of barbed wire.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-188" class="calibre1">Her skin is more golden than brown, and the only soft
                        thing about her are her full lips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“And this is Mary’s sister-in-law, Rose St. Pierre.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nice to meet you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Same.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi pushes me into a chair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What did I miss?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That Mrs. Bullis made a big speech about how women’s brains are just as heavy
                        as men’s. They done research on that. Then they put us all to work on this banner for the horse
                        race, since Mrs. Payne accepted their bid, and you know who had a hand in that.” She winks.
                        “And, oh, did you catch the Miss Sweetie article yesterday?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I did,” I say, holding my breath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We’re also supposed to write down the ‘Custom-aries’ that work against women.
                        Mrs. Bullis says she’ll collect the best and send them to the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> on
                        behalf of the Atlanta Suffragists. Why do you look so surprised? You got a good one?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, but I bet you do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Almost done adding my bit.” Noemi writes on her paper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nice work,” I tell Mary, who has sewn an impressive image of the horse’s
                        hindquarters on her fabric, and not a single grinning stitch. The other tables have barely
                        started on their squares.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Course they got to give us the horse’s backside,” says Rose. “And why do you
                        think that is?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Because that’s the half that gets things done, that’s why.” Noemi sets down
                        her pencil. “We been standing in the back for a long time, but we can change that when we get
                        the vote.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They don’t care about us. Just using us as always.” Rose tugs the fabric away
                        from Mary. “Let me add some stitches so I can say I did something.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi hands me the list. “What do you think?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="calibre21">“I think I know who said what,” I say, looking at each face in turn. Rose is
                        watching Mrs. Bullis and Mrs. Bread Loaf draw closer as they pass out marigold sashes from a
                        cardboard box. Without even looking at us, they sweep by.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-189" class="calibre21">Noemi quickly gets to her feet. “Excuse me, Mrs. Bullis,
                        ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I was just wondering if we could get some of those sashes, too?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“These are for wearing at the race.” Mrs. Bullis sweeps her restless fingers
                        down the length of a sash, petting it as if it were a cat’s tail.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, ma’am. We’ll be there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The petting stops, and Mrs. Bullis cuts her gaze to Mrs. Bread Loaf, who is
                        squeezing the box to her chest as if it might try to run away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mary works on Saturdays,” says Mrs. Bullis.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mary, who is wrapping an embroidery thread around her finger, glances around
                        her and then back down at her lap. “I was hoping you’d let me have a few hours off, ma’am.”
                        Mary’s voice is whisper soft. “To support the cause, and all.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m sorry, Mary. The cause doesn’t need you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Rose pauses her work on something resembling a potato and rolls the needle
                        between her fingers. I bet she’s thinking about which end of the top hat she’d like to stick it
                        to.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi seems to sway on her feet, an oak enduring a wind. “But you just said in
                        your speech that the woman’s hour is at hand. Ain’t we, that is, aren’t we women? And we’re
                        about finished with our part. Even wrote some Custom-aries that need releasing, right here.” She
                        holds out her list.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bullis’s eyes rake over the list and then she blows out a breath that
                        reminds me of Frederick. “These are not women’s concerns, they are colored concerns.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They’re not colored concerns, they’re human concerns, and women make up half
                        the humans. If we all work together, we can make some real change. Laws that fix the bad smell.
                        Laws that give us rights to keep our property, instead of letting good-for-nothing husbands
                        gamble it away. You want that, don’t you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bullis’s teapot face blows steam. “How dare you! Mary?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mary jerks, eyes wide.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi knots her shawl tight over her solid arms and keeps her gaze fixed on
                        Mrs. Bullis’s chin. “Mary didn’t tell about your situation, Mrs. Bullis. It’s well-known, is
                        all.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bullis reels up her nose as high as it will go, eyes searching out a good
                        place to cast her hook. “You’ll have to wait your turn, <i class="calibre7">all</i> of
                        you”&mdash;she glares at me&mdash;“just like we did. Your men got the vote, but most sold it for
                        drinking money. Now it’s our turn.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The room has gone silent. You would probably hear the drop of a needle if one
                        were to fall. On the other side of the room, Lizzie’s face is stretched long, though Mrs.
                        English is staring through the ceiling, maybe wondering why she is here and not home soaking her
                        feet.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre21">Noemi rocks from side to side, but when she speaks, her
                        voice is even as steel tracks. “If any did sell their votes, they likely did so only because
                        they thought it made no difference how they cast them. A greased pig isn’t worth much if you
                        can’t hold on to it long enough to make bacon.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t know what you’re talking about, and you’re verging on impertinence.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi takes her time filling her lungs, her lowered gaze taking in all the eyes
                        cooling on her. “Ma’am, what I’m saying is, we got plenty of good women waiting to cast our
                        ballots and make things right again for everyone. And we’re going to keep pulling for ballots,
                        whether you let us or not.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A collective gasp sweeps through the room, and then whispers start up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bullis’s marigold sash whips through the air, a jag of lightning. “I think
                        it’s time you leave. You, too, Mary. Go back home and work on the curtains like I asked.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mary’s head is bowed, exposing the bumps of her neck bones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mary, do you hear me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Rose bites off thread with her teeth and mutters, “She hears you.” She squints
                        hard enough to tangle her lashes, and it’s as if she were trying to keep her vexation from
                        seeping out her eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mary unbends her neck, and I’m reminded of a bird unfolding. She gathers her
                        gray skirts and rises. “I don’t want to do the curtains right now, Mrs. Bullis.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Don’t want to do . . . ,” Mrs. Bullis echoes, looking wildly around her as if
                        she could be the butt of a joke. “Well, then you . . .” Her eyes fall upon the embroidered
                        half-horse, and she sucks in her sentence. A good seamstress can be hard to find. Especially
                        with so many vultures waiting to swoop in. “All of you, go. Just go!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi’s nostrils flare, and I would not be surprised to see smoke curling out
                        of them. She snatches her list back from Mrs. Bullis. With her head held not too high, nor too
                        low, she crosses to the exit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We file behind her, each passing over a creaky floorboard. The shame that warms
                        my cheeks feels more diffuse than it did at age thirteen, and I gather it in my hands and set it
                        in a corner. Maybe self-worth is something we grow into day by day, the way a spine elongates
                        and calcifies. Hammer Foot once said that people don’t lack strength, they lack the will. As I
                        follow Noemi and her friends out the door of the Grace Baptist Church, I muse he wasn’t talking
                        about these ladies, whose iron wills may not shine, but do ring when hammered.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">T<span class="calibre9">HE STREETLAMPS FLICKER </span>as we pass by, and a
                        three-quarter moon keeps its eye on us. Rose slips an arm around Mary, who sways a little on her
                        feet. “Well, that was a bust. I didn’t even get to finish my stitches.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Just what were you stitching anyway?” asks Noemi. “A squirrel?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nope.” Rose throws a grin back at us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A pinecone?” I offer, but she shakes her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh no, Rose, you didn’t,” says Mary.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I did. They deserve a few patty cakes. Maybe next time, they’ll think twice
                        about giving us the back end of the horse.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The night is cool but not cold. Water droplets hang in the air, blowing wet
                        kisses at our cheeks as we walk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We should form our own society,” Noemi says quietly from beside me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Rose snorts. “Please, Noemi. Not until I’ve had a hot bath.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A voice calls after us. “Jo! Wait, Jo?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We all look around. Lizzie waves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You go on,” I tell the others. By the time slow-footed Lizzie catches up, they
                        could be home in bed. “I’m just around the corner.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“See you in the kitchen tomorrow.” With a wink, Noemi leads the others off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">By the time Lizzie catches up, the women are no more than ripples against the
                        screen of night. “I didn’t expect to see you here,” she drawls.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nor I you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She throws back a tuft of hair, but it returns, like a terrier wanting to play
                        fetch. “What happened back there was just so”&mdash;she wiggles her gloved
                        fingers&mdash;“unseemly. I didn’t want to be a suffragist, but Mrs. English said it’s the right
                        thing to do, and plus it’s good for business.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She’s right on both counts.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, well, Mother wasn’t happy. She says politics are too difficult for women
                        to understand and that we should trust the men. She’s not a fan of Miss Sweetie.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I feign interest in a passing carriage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Not like me.” Her blue eyes watch me with an unexpected intensity, and my skin
                        tingles. “I <i class="calibre7">know</i>, Jo.” She brings her face close enough for me to notice
                        a thin white scar above her eyebrow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hardly breathe. “You know what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">You</i> are Miss Sweetie.”</p>

                        letter from Hatless in Atlanta, asking how to stretch a tight hat? I wrote that letter. I didn’t

                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh.” My kneecaps bobble. She could unmask me. The <i
                            class="calibre7">Focus</i> would lose its credibility, and all the work Miss Sweetie has
                        done will slip loose, like poorly tied knots. “You won’t tell, will you? I could get into real
                        trouble if anyone finds out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Shoo, why would you say that? We’re friends, aren’t we?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Er, friends, yes. Thank you, Lizzie. I appreciate it. You should get back to
                        the meeting. Mrs. English will be wondering where you’re off to.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, she won’t. She sent me after you to ask you about those knots.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Please tell her she can order them exclusively through Buxbaum’s.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before reaching the abandoned barn, I conceal myself between a pair of trees,
                        tempted to detour toward the Bells’. However, as far as I can tell, “The Custom-ary” has done
                        its job raising interest and not pitchforks. Surely subscriptions will follow. If I visited
                        Nathan, it would be for personal reasons, and there should be nothing more personal between us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A rustle in the grass freezes me in place. I strain to see into the field of
                        weeds and brush that stretches out to the street fifty yards behind me. But anything more than a
                        few paces away has been tarred in night. I should’ve paid more attention, instead of walking so
                        deep in my thoughts.</p>

                    <p class="calibre21">“Good morning,” I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae claps me on the shoulder with one of her rug-beater arms. “Morning,

                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi straightens. “Good, you’re here. There’s trouble afoot, and it ain’t

                    <p class="calibre21">“Is it walking toward us?” Perhaps Caroline has confronted Mrs. Payne with the
                        rumor of her illegitimacy. If so, Mrs. Payne will need to stamp out that fire before the good

                    <p class="calibre21">“Let’s hope not. It all started with Miss Sweetie’s article ‘The Singular
                        Question.’ You seen it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, I’ve read it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae folds the newspaper and sets it in the letter basket she usually
                        delivers to Mrs. Payne every morning. “I never saw the good in catching a husband, myself. Why
                        would I want another job waiting for me back at home?” She ties on a bonnet. “The chickens are
                        waiting for me. Mind you walk soft today and don’t bother Mrs. Payne. She’s in one of her
                        melancholies.” Out the door she goes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi takes up a narrow knife and, with smooth strokes of her wrist, slices the
                        meat from a freshly severed lamb shank. “They in a fit over Merritt’s broken engagement. Mr.
                        Payne didn’t go to the mills today, and seems no one here can talk without slamming a door.
                        According to Solomon, Mr. Payne paid the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> a visit yesterday and
                        demanded they expose Miss Sweetie.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I sag against the counter, not trusting my legs to support me. “What did they
                        say?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They showed him the door. Then today, this shows up.” She pulls out the
                        newspaper she’d been reading to Etta Rae. It’s the <i class="calibre7">Constitution</i>, with
                        its distinctively wide pages and dense columns. The leftmost article grabs my attention.</p>

                        weeks to stop eavesdropping.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt’s breakup must really have put a stone on Mr. Payne’s tracks. If he
                        wants to shut down the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>, all he need do is cut off its paper
                        supply. By orchestrating a witch hunt, he exacts a little humiliation to boot. He can’t know the
                        kind of public scorn they would face if the truth were known: that a Chinese girl had duped
                        everyone. But of course that won’t happen. It can’t. Only Lizzie Crump knows the truth, and
                        while she might be slow in the foot and frivolous, she is not cruel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I fetch a mug. Miss Sweetie will not be intimidated, not after she’s come this
                        far. The <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> has nearly reached two thousand subscriptions, and once
                        the sponsors see the newspaper’s success, surely alternative paper sources could be found.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You waiting for me to put change in there?” Noemi eyes the empty mug I’m
                        strangling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I set down the mug and pour the coffee, hoping she does not see the way my
                        hands shake. “That Miss Sweetie’s sure stirring up trouble.” For herself and everyone around
                        her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi scrapes away the silver skin encasing her meat. “I like her. In fact, I’m
                        fixing to write her my own letter about those suffragists. We got the same working parts as
                        those other women, but their hate’s more important than getting the vote.” With a flick of her
                        wrist, Noemi chucks the tough skin into the slop bucket. “Course, that Miss Sweetie is white and
                        probably wouldn’t answer me.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-194" class="calibre21">“Even if she doesn’t write back, I bet she’d agree with
                        you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You think?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, I do.”</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9"> CARRY MY </span>tray up to Caroline’s room, noticing
                        the door to Mrs. Payne’s study is closed. She rarely closes the door. It is the melancholy at
                        work, no doubt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s vanity is back in its corner, but she’s staring out her window when
                        I enter her chambers. I wonder if trouble looks less scary when glimpsed through a pane of
                        glass. “Are you well, miss?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She doesn’t answer, but her gaze drops from the window to the floor. There’s a
                        restlessness to the way she moves, and the dimple in her cheek seems to have changed overnight
                        into a permanent pinch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After setting her tray before her, I straighten her bedsheets, having my own
                        frown lines to mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How does it feel to be a nobody?” She taps at the shell of her soft-boiled
                        egg.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My temper flares. “How does it feel to be an overstuffed porcupine?” The words
                        fall before I can catch them. It occurs to me that with Mr. Q out of the picture, I no longer
                        have leverage to demand reasonable treatment. The good news is, I’m pretty sure our agreement
                        made no difference in how Caroline treated me, anyway.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t know why I put up with an ill-bred hussy like yourself,” she snaps,
                        though her words lack the heat of true indignation. Sighing, she sets down her spoon. “If the
                        rumor is true, Mama and I might have to move to the country. Perhaps it will be nice to live in
                        anonymity. I won’t have to pretend I like anyone, and I can go about as I please. Grandpapa has
                        many horses.” Her eyes follow as I arrange her pillows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Most nobodies I know don’t have horses.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She scoops a spoonful of egg but, instead of eating it, lets the golden
                        treasure drip back into the shell. “I think I would enjoy the simple life. I might even take up
                        drawing. Or horticulture.” She eyes her potted violet. “I raised that one from a seedling.
                        Almost got the bud to bloom, too.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I crisp the corners of her bedsheets. “Most nobodies I know don’t have time for
                        horticulture.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You are drear.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shake out a petticoat she has left on the floor. “Most nobodies I know are
                        drear.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre21">Her mouth buckles, and then she aims her gaze out the
                        window again. “Would you come with me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She holds herself very still, and a cloud draws a shadow on her face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The memory of how the kittens destroyed her mother’s study scratches at me, and
                        my laugh sounds bitter. “You despise me, don’t you remember?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I despise everyone.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She snorts. “Who knows? I wanted her to myself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne left when Caroline was two, too young for her to remember, but maybe
                        the heart remembers what the mind is too young to grasp. Perhaps that is why Caroline hates
                        Noemi so much. Her mammy’s own child took priority. But me? I was just a poor orphan to whom
                        Mrs. Payne was occasionally kind. Maybe in her young mind, Caroline considered every nod to
                        someone else a snub to herself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Old Gin believes I should take a husband.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Marriage? But who would marry <i class="calibre7">you</i>?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I bristle. “Someone with exquisite taste, obviously.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I <i class="calibre7">mean</i>, there are no Chinese in Atlanta.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“There are some in Augusta.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ugh, no, not those commoners.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Plumping one of her overstuffed pillows, I toss it against the carved
                        headboard, where it makes a satisfying <i class="calibre7">oomph!</i> like a gut being punched.
                        “We have a saying. The superior man thinks of virtue, the common man, comfort.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She trills her fingers at me. “Virtue is overrated. Papa worked hard for every
                        dime we have, and says that we . . .” Abruptly, she turns from me and stares out the window
                        again. I can’t help wondering if she just remembered her father might not be the man she thinks.
                        “He says that we deserve to live in comfort,” she finishes softly. “Take the tray. I’m no longer
                        hungry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She folds her hands in her lap. With her shoulders rounding forward and her
                        dressing gown wrinkled about her, she reminds me of one of the crumpled newspapers in Etta Rae’s
                        basket. I curse myself for feeling pity for her and slide the tray off her table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Even before I get to the stairs, Mr. Payne’s booming voice is making the
                        pictures rattle against the wall. I pull in my stomach and descend. His voice suggests the kind
                        of man who fills the doorframe, the sort with a jaw that could bite through a steel bit or a
                        brow that juts like an overhanging brick. But the truth is, he is nothing remarkable to behold.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I peer through the leaves of a philodendron plant that manages to thrive
                        despite the smoke on this floor. Mr. Payne carries his medium frame with a light clip, pacing as
                        far as the telephone will allow. His head might be hard, but there’s a definite sag in his jaw,
                        a melding together of chin and neck like a turkey gullet. A center part splits his dark blond
                        hair into two even shares, slicked against his head with his signature ylang-ylang hair oil.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre21">“Merritt <i class="calibre7">is</i> of the highest
                        caliber, that duplicitous Bostonian wench.” He pauses as the other person speaks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I tell you, it’s a conspiracy and it’s only going to get worse. Mark my words,
                        that Miss Sweetie is a Yankee sent to infiltrate our ranks. When I smoke out the witch&mdash;and
                        I <i class="calibre7">will</i> smoke her out&mdash;we’ll see how loud those Bells ring.” His
                        eyes, brown as the butt of a rifle, are suddenly looking at me.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Thirty-one</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">I step out from behind the philodendron, which feels as
                            paltry as a</span> fig leaf. The muscles of the businessman’s face shift ever so slightly as
                        his attention abandons the speaker.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With the breakfast tray dug into my ribs, I stumble out from behind the plant.
                        But instead of making tracks away, someone has poured iron in my boots. Mr. Payne’s chin swings
                        to one side, pulling the gullet with it. His gaze rummages my person, one eye squinting more
                        than the other, as if that were the one he uses to judge the world. “Gilford, I will ring you
                        later.” He sets the receiver back on its cradle. “Come closer, girl,” he orders in the kind of
                        commanding voice that could part the sea. “Set that down. Jo, isn’t it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, sir.” I rest the tray on a side table and then pick my way across a
                        carpeted runner, stopping when I am two paces away. The cherry scent of a cigar recently smoked
                        perfumes the air, and paintings of long-dead relatives grimace at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How old are you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pinch the sides of my maid’s dress, my gaze fixed on his gullet. “Seventeen,
                        sir.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His scrutiny grows heavier, and my breath shorter. I try not to stare at the
                        flesh curtain of his throat. He knows I know something about Miss Sweetie. He can sense it.
                        Maybe the intuition that makes him Atlanta’s paper king has heard the panicked flapping of
                        truth, ready to spring from my mouth like a quail from the bush.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Old Gin tells me he has educated you. And that you like reading newspapers.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I swallow hard. “I&mdash;I&mdash;”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-197" class="calibre21">“Speak up, girl.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I force myself to breathe. “I like to be informed. P. T. Barnum said, ‘He who
                        is without a newspaper is cut off from his species.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“P. T. might’ve been a politician, but he was a circus man at heart. I am fond
                        of newspapers myself, but lately, I have found they are full of drivel. Sensationalist slush
                        more likely to raise blood pressure than understanding.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, sir,” I squeak, hoping he will excuse me now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Tell me, are you familiar with this Dear Miss Sweetie column?” His voice
                        dribbles with disgust at the name.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, sir.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“And what do you think of her column ‘The Singular Question’?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My opinion is of no consequence.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Nonsense. You are a young woman who reads newspapers, the quarry for whom this
                        woman has sprung her traps. Do you feel this article emboldens women to reject marriage in
                        pursuit of their own interests?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Here it is. My chance to confess. If I take responsibility, perhaps he’ll
                        overlook his grievance with the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> and things can return to the way
                        they were before Miss Sweetie arrived on the page.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My toes curl in my boots, trying to keep myself planted, but the world has
                        begun to spin too fast. Visions of our local jail, with its stone walls that constantly echo the
                        wails from within, grip me with terror. “I think . . .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He stretches his chin up, his eyes zeroed in on mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I have known your daughter for a long time. She has always been spirited. One
                        day, she shall make a fine wife.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The man’s face lights up in a way that should assure Caroline that, even if the
                        rumors of her being illegitimate are true, her father will never deny her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, she is my greatest treasure.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As daughters should be. However, if she finds that no man is worthy of her,
                        would you force her to marry someone anyway?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Of course not. But she should be encouraged to keep looking.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As Old Gin likes to say, not all horses are meant to race, but all horses are
                        meant to run. If Caroline is happy, are you not happy for her? As you know, she cares little for
                        the diversions of other women. She’s bright and well-versed in the business of Payne Mills. If
                        she were allowed to do something productive and meaningful there, her temper might be much
                        improved.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I clamp my mouth shut. But my words have already galloped off, and there is no
                        calling them back. I wait for the man to reprimand me for insulting his daughter, but his eyes
                        have lost focus and he is rubbing his shoulder. Perhaps he is imagining his daughter
                        accompanying him to work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Miss Sweetie’s words are not meant solely for young women like Caroline, but
                        their fathers, mothers, brothers, and anyone who desires for them a happy, useful life.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre21">He makes a guttural noise, probably the prelude to a
                        spouting-off, but then his attention catches on something behind me. “Princess, you’re up
                        early.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline steps out from behind the traitorous philodendron, likely placed there
                        to catch eavesdroppers like us. “Good morning, Papa,” she says, letting him kiss her cheek.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She casts me a look that is half confusion and half surprise, sugared by
                        wonder. Then she refocuses on her father, clearing his throat with loud rumbles. Maybe he is
                        wondering how much Caroline overheard. Maybe <i class="calibre7">she</i> is puzzling out what
                        she missed. I scoop up the tray.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pick my way down the stairs, hoping I have cleared the path of a few
                        boulders.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">F<span class="calibre9">OR THE AFTERNOON </span>ride, Caroline wants to ride
                        solo again, but this time I doubt the cemetery is her destination.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato and I draw up to Six Paces. A familiar horse screams. Not far from
                        the abandoned hansom, Merritt’s muscular frame draws a striking figure, impeccably draped in a
                        blue riding coat, his midsize hat dignifying his sweep of brown-blond curls. I edge my mare
                        away, but it is too late.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When he spots us, a rakish grin bends the perfect line of Merritt’s mustache.
                        “Hullo, Jo!” He trots Ameer up to us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I am glad to see you in good spirits, sir.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Never been better. Ever since the news broke of my, er, status, I’ve received,
                        so far, four invitations to Mama’s horse race. It’s curious how things work out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It doesn’t surprise me. He has always been one of the most eligible bachelors
                        this side of the Mason-Dixon Line. Jane Bentley is a distant memory.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I rather like being a coquet. It’s a good life you ladies have. I don’t know
                        why those suffragists are so hell-bent on being men.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Miss Sweetie bristles. “They don’t want to be men, only to be allowed to have a
                        say. God wouldn’t have given us feet if He didn’t want us to walk. By the same token, why give
                        us a brain if He didn’t want us to have thoughts?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He paces Ameer in front of us, his eyes roving my figure. I’m suddenly all too
                        aware of the form-fitting nature of my riding breeches and turn Sweet Potato to block the view.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He laughs. “I’m merely admiring your . . . thoughts.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The thoughts happen higher up.” A warning bell clangs in my head. The most
                        powerful piece in Chinese chess, the chariot, goes where it wants, felling anything in its path,
                        while I am a lowly disposable soldier. Merritt and I might’ve been friends once, but now that we
                        are older, lines must be drawn. Miss Sweetie would insist on it. “I’m sorry, sir, but your
                        family is my employer. I must be on my way.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre21">Something wistful passes over his face. “Can we not be
                        friends?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, I’m afraid not.” My mare ferries us off, and this time, I do not look
                        back.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">The printer whirs and thrums next to my ear. I am back
                            to listening</span> in on the Bells, if only to assure myself they are still in business.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin is spending tonight again at the Paynes’. I finish tying a knot from
                        the spools of cord Mr. Buxbaum sent through Noemi.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The printer stops and the soothing tones of Mrs. Bell’s voice tumble down, too
                        distant to hear. Nathan’s voice follows. “Let him try to shut us down.” His voice grips the
                        words. “The more he blows, the weaker his son looks.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Not if the <i class="calibre7">Constitution</i> turns this into a witch hunt
                        for Miss Sweetie. <i class="calibre7">I</i> could claim responsibility. It would make sense that
                        the publisher’s wife is Miss Sweetie. Probably no one would care after that.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-200" class="calibre21">“Exactly. People would stop caring.” Something bumps the
                        desk, maybe Nathan’s fist. “As much as people want to know who she is, her anonymity is part of
                        her allure. She could be anyone, a sister, a friend, a neighbor. It’s what makes her relatable.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What will your father say?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No doubt he’ll have a fit. ‘Revolution is best taken by the teaspoon, not the
                        glass.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I replug the listening tube. The idea that I have created discord in the Bell
                        household stirs an itchy restlessness in me. My socks catch against the uneven concrete floor as
                        I trek to Old Gin’s room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The silk lies in a neatly folded pile. He finished it. My fingers glide over
                        the thick cloth, pausing on the chrysanthemums woven into the silk in gold thread. I lift out
                        the garment. To my surprise, it falls into two pieces. I hold up a long-sleeved blouse, which is
                        more of a jacket that fastens down the middle, and a pair of close-fitting pants that taper at
                        the ankle. Strange.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Stripping down to my cotton underclothes, I step into Old Gin’s creation. My
                        feet just fit through the tapered openings, and I cinch the waist tight. The jacket hangs
                        looser. Five button-and-loop closures down the middle resemble gold frogs. Old Gin’s knot-tying
                        surpasses even mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I consider my outfit. With a cap and from the back, I might pass for Johnny
                        Fortune in riding silks. I strut with my nose in the air, like a puffed-up jock.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Now, who would marry a woman wearing such a peculiar getup?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I freeze so fast, my socks nearly slip out from under me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin and I stand the same height, though he bests me in girth by an inch or
                        two.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The outfit is not for me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The words on the Paynes’ flyer parade through my head . . . <i
                            class="calibre7">Mr. and Mrs. Winston Payne invite all Atlantans to attend an eight-furlong
                            race at Piedmont Park Racetrack, a purse of $300 to be awarded to the winner.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Three hundred dollars is the same amount Shang owed Billy Riggs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Coincidence? Coincidence is just destiny unfolding.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin is planning to run in Mrs. Payne’s horse race.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Perhaps that is why Sweet Potato knows her way to the track. It occurs to me
                        that Old Gin’s birdlike appetite may not have been due to sickness after all, but discipline.
                        The less weight for Sweet Potato to carry, the faster she will be. I peel off the deceptive
                        outfit, and the glossy weave of the silk catches on a hangnail. I suck on my finger. Even the
                        most beautiful of fabrics has a traitorous side, and so, it seems, does Old Gin.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I<span class="calibre9"> OVERSLEEP</span>, <span class="calibre9">OWING
                        </span>to a restless night, and half walk, half jog down Peachtree, frozen hands stuck under my
                        arms. At least the nippy air clears my foggy head. My two fishtail braids whip my backside with
                        every hurried step.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sixty-year-old men have no business racing horses. Old Gin’s knees creak and
                        his back seizes up when the weather is too damp. Not to mention, months of hacking must have
                        crumpled his lungs into paper sacks. A horse race could kill him. Each beast is a
                        thousand-and-a-half-pound engine of muscle and flesh, all stampeding down the same narrow
                        corridor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shiver, and not just from the chill. It’s cracked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Preposterous.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Unthinkable.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Yet here I am, still thinking about it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If anyone knows how to ride a horse, it’s Old Gin. Johnny Fortune might be as
                        steady as a bird on a fence, but Old Gin is a bird on a clothesline. He has a natural equine
                        understanding that transcends any learned skill. In fact, it was his ability to calm a steed
                        that had gone wild in the middle of a Shanghai marketplace that caught the eye of a wealthy
                        American businessman. When Winston Payne offered him a job in America, Old Gin, not so old then,
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">And Sweet Potato is in her prime. Light on her feet with a competitive spirit.
                        She could get the job done.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Twenty minutes later, the trim lawn of the Payne Estate spreads before me. The
                        paved driveway, the crab apple trees, and the white columns&mdash;none appear any different from
                        previous days. Still, the scene appears too orderly, the edges too crisp, the colors too sharp.
                        Or perhaps it simply looks that way in contrast to the messiness of my own thoughts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Though I am already a quarter of an hour late, I bypass the kitchen and hurry
                        to the stables.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Half the horses are gone, including Sweet Potato, and there is no sign of Old
                        Gin or Mr. Crycks. A stable boy mucks out the stalls, while Solomon scours the rust off a
                        section of an old wheel. I had once thought Solomon a giant, but the years seem to have hollowed
                        out the Paynes’ all-around man, who is nearly as old as Old Gin. He looks up from his work, and
                        his neck bones crack. “Why hello, Jo. Looking for Old Gin?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hello, Solomon, yes. Have you seen him?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He and Mr. Crycks took some of the horses for exercises. Probably be back in
                        an hour or two. Something the matter?” He rubs a handkerchief over his red-brown skin.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre21">“No, er, it can wait. If you see him, will you let him
                        know I need to speak with him?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sure thing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi’s watering her vegetable garden with rinse water when I return to the
                        house. On her apron strap, she’s tied a cluster of bluebells. “Nice of you to show up.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I overslept. Nice flowers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m starting my own suffrage society. The Atlanta Bluebells, for the belles of
                        a different color.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s a good name. Do you know where Mrs. Payne is?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Upstairs in her study, I think. Everything okay?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hurry into the kitchen and hastily assemble Caroline’s tray. Both the cream
                        and the coffee slosh over the sides of their vessels as I carry the tray upstairs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline is calculating some figures on her writing table when I set the tray
                        beside her. “Good morning. Excuse me for a moment.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Excuse you? You just got here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I ignore her and slip down the hallway. The door to Mrs. Payne’s office is like
                        a raised hand, warning me away. She will not like my impertinence. But she alone chose the
                        contestants.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I knock. When no one answers, I knock again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Come in,” she says, and not in her usual pleasant voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne sits at her desk, writing in her Lady’s Planner. I assume it’s where
                        she records her deepest feelings, as she never leaves it in plain sight. Maybe she hides it in a
                        boot the way we do our savings. You can tell a lot about what someone values by what they hide.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo, I asked not to be disturbed. Whatever is the matter?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m sorry, ma’am.” My prepared words all fly out of my head. I blurt out, “Is
                        Old Gin racing Sweet Potato in your horse race?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But why?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Because he asked me.” She sets down her pen and gets to her feet. Her shawl
                        lies across another chair, and she ties it over her wrinkled housedress.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He’ll be ridiculed. And his sponsor will not be happy. They’ll complain, and
                        you’ll probably have to refund their bid. It might cause a scandal. Not to mention, he’s sixty!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I have thought of those things, of course. There will be no gambling odds on
                        him, as the odds are written for twelve players. The suffragists will be matched to Sweet
                        Potato. They are fortunate to be in the race and won’t complain.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre21">So much for a random draw. “Actually, I have met their
                        president, and she is not exactly a shrinking violet.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t require advice on this matter. Old Gin is a grown man. You should
                        respect his decision.” There’s a warning in her tone. Her black slippers peek out from her dress
                        hem, two arrows pointing to the exit. She crosses her arms, drawing an X over her center.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My eyes fall to her planner, still open on the desk beside us. She seems to be
                        writing a letter of some sort. At the bottom, she has signed it with a loop. A lowercase <i
                            class="calibre7">e</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">An <i class="calibre7">e</i> for Emma.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne’s eyebrows clothespin together, and noticing my interest in her
                        planner, she reaches over and closes the book.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But it is too late. I have already seen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My mind churns like a loom, drawing threads, weaving connections, finding
                        patterns. “You wrote the letter.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her face twists in confusion.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You asked him to forgive you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She begins to say something but swallows it back down. “You&mdash;you’ve seen
                        this letter?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes. You wrote his name in Chinese. Shang.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I watch the way hearing the name tears at her face, causes the delicate planes
                        to tremble. She covers her mouth. Her wedding band draws my eye, a worry bead for her adultery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Q was right. She had an illegitimate daughter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But it was not Caroline.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My head begins to swim, and my knees give way, but Mrs. Payne collapses on the
                        floor, one step ahead of me.</p>

                    <h2>Thirty-three</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">The sharp odor of smelling salts rouses me from my
                            deadened</span> state. Etta Rae helps me into a seated position on the floor of the study.
                        “Wh-what happened?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You fainted. Both of you did. You were only out for a few minutes. How are you
                        feeling?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My head throbs, but nothing feels broken. On the outside, at least. Mrs. Payne
                        comes into view, propped up a few feet away with her back against the desk, her hair slipped
                        from its knot. “I’ll be okay,” I say, not bothering to hide my anger.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne lifts her gaze to meet mine, but the effort is too great. “It was
                        for the best,” she whispers hoarsely. The similarities are undeniable. Our bony fingers, our
                        bumpy shoulders, even our widow’s peaks, and the pearl at the center of our upper lips.
                        Apparently, we even faint alike. More pieces tumble together: her yearlong melancholic spell,
                        during which she left to live with her parents in Savannah; the story about the filly she was
                        forced to give up, the one she named Savannah Joy. Jo is a bastardization of Joy. A bastard,
                        like me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Shakily, I rise, despite Etta Rae’s protests. It’s not clear to me why the
                        woman’s here, only that Etta Rae has always been here. Her lips purse, and a prick of regret
                        dulls her light brown eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne still doesn’t look at me. I sway, pummeled by emotions that leave me
                        breathless. Anger, hurt, shame, each takes its turn on me, bruising me deep in my core. The
                        truth is worse than I imagined. In all my years here, she has been watching me grow with no more
                        regard than for a thickening meadow. Each glance was a denial; every word, a rejection. Her gaze
                        skitters over my pebbled-goat-leather boots, perhaps noticing for the first time how my toes
                        have stretched them to the breaking point.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre21">My mother didn’t leave me. She abandoned me. Women like
                        her do not, cannot form affinities with people like me, not if they wish to remain on the top
                        branch. They are knots that slip out easily with the barest of tugs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae pulls over a chair and helps Mrs. Payne into it. Caroline bursts into
                        the study. “Maid, you forgot the utensils. What’s going on here? Mama, you look like you’ve seen
                        a ghost!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">No one answers. Caroline glares at the housekeeper, as if prodding her to
                        explain, but Etta Rae’s lips remain closed. Caroline blows out a frustrated breath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When four winds meet, there is only silence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne’s eyes plead with me to understand. And though I know well the
                        fences that corral us into our designated squares, I also know there are the chains we are born
                        into, and those we choose to wear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I take off my apron and set it on Mrs. Payne’s desk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No.” Caroline snatches it back and pushes it toward me, but when I don’t take
                        it, she drops it and grabs my arms. “Don’t go. What did you do, Jo? Why is Mama crying?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae glances at Mrs. Payne, who gives her the barest nod. “Let your sister
                        go, child,” says Etta Rae.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She knew, too. Shame takes another jab at me. Who else? Has the world conspired
                        against me?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My sis&mdash;” A soft gasp releases from Caroline’s mouth. “Oh my God.” She
                        gapes, searching my face for the truth, but the truth is in the details we both missed while she
                        was gazing in the mirror and I was looking away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I descend the staircase for what I know will be the last time. A sob builds in
                        my chest, but I bar it from leaving. Dignity can only be surrendered, and when it is gone, we
                        are like the snail who has lost its shell. All it can do is find the nearest leaf and hope it’s
                        not parade day. At least the snail never need care who its parents are.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The front door fights me, and the paved stones of the driveway scheme to trip
                        my feet. The jangle of an approaching carriage pulls my attention. A vehicle painted a
                        distinctive cabbage green with gold lettering sets off an alarm bell in my head. I conceal
                        myself in the shade of a magnolia, watching the carriage swing into the Paynes’ driveway. What
                        would Crump’s Paints be doing in this neighborhood? The Paynes do not buy discount paints, even
                        if their house needed a touch-up, which it does not.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The passenger pushes aside her curtain, and I catch sight of her heavy-lidded
                        eyes, her thin nose, and the withered rind of her mouth. Something icy chills my stomach.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-205" class="calibre21">Mrs. Crump is here because of me. I recall the way the
                        woman looked at me when Nathan suggested Lizzie find another escort, as if I were to blame.
                        Lizzie must have told her my secret, and now she is here to expose me, the troublemaker. She
                        does not know I have nothing to lose now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If only the same could be said of the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hurry away, barely noticing Sully’s streetcar until it is rolling briskly
                        past me with <i class="calibre7">clangs</i> that make my ears ring. The ever-present reek of
                        sewage strangles the scent of the magnolias and overwhelms my sinuses. Too much morning light
                        pours into my eyes. Yet Peachtree rolls along as always, heedless of the pain coursing down its
                        veins.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My thoughts race. Leading the pack is the question of how my parents met. Old
                        Gin said Shang was a groom, too. Maybe he’d even worked at the Payne Estate. Did Shang know
                        about the baby he left behind? I imagine the man, two hands taller than me but not much wider, a
                        shadowy figure shaking dice in his loose fist, a maverick who desired more than his earthly
                        allotment. A bitter fluid burns my throat, and tears fill my eyes. I grip my damask bag to me
                        like it is the only thing that might keep me anchored to this world.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">And what about Mr. Payne? How did she hide a pregnancy from her husband? A
                        deep-enough pocket can hide many things, and just as her husband is ruthless, Mrs. Payne is
                        shrewd. And sometimes the eye sees what it wants and skips over what is in plain sight. Mr.
                        Payne had the biggest house on Peachtree Street, the most successful mill in Atlanta, the belle
                        of the ball for a wife, a son, <i class="calibre7">and</i> a daughter. Why fix what was not
                        broken?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">So many questions. So many lies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A crow squawks from somewhere nearby, but I hardly hear it. Old Gin knew,
                        that’s for certain. Lucky Yip’s urn almost dances before me, a child’s lie compared to this
                        whopper. Why else would Mrs. Payne allow him, a lowly and aging servant, to ride in her race?
                        Guilt. Was he ever going to tell me? There are many arrows of blame in my bow, and without the
                        proper targets, many are pointed at him. All my life, Old Gin knew exactly who I was. He lied to
                        me for seventeen years, even when I was desperate to know who left me on his doorstep. I hear
                        myself whimper and wonder if I am collapsing into myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bile rises again in my throat, and I force it back down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Instead of going home, I steer my rudder toward Whitehall. It is still early
                        enough that most shops haven’t opened, though the cloth-covered food stalls by Union Station
                        have begun unfolding&mdash;one row of white sellers and another row of colored farther down.
                        With few pedestrians out and a sky as clear as glass, there’s a crystalline quality about the
                        city that I feel like shattering with a kick of my heel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I was seven, Robby’s mother, a washerwoman, built a contraption for
                        spinning the water out of laundry using a barrel with a crank. Once, I tried stopping the barrel
                        with my hand&mdash;it was going too fast for my eyes to track &mdash;and got a scolding that
                        burned more than the raspberry on my palm. “You got no business trying to stop this. Run along
                        and do the things you supposed to be doing.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre21">Maybe the world is like that spinner, and I should stop
                        touching it so much and let it spin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Buxbaum’s brick façade and long display windows stretch before me, its neat
                        appearance somehow anchoring the chaos in my head. Before entering the shop, I attempt to
                        breathe away some of my anger.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Even the sight of Robby folding a bolt of cloth at the far wall only cheers me
                        a little. He is filling in again, which must be a good sign.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Don’t tell me you finished those knots already,” he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nod, not trusting my voice. I set down my damask bag, containing a hundred
                        knots, on the waist-high table where Robby has been cutting fabric. “I no longer work for the
                        Paynes,” I spill.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His eyes soften. It’s funny how one glance of sympathy can trigger an avalanche
                        of self-pity. I worry my finger into a knot in the oak, refusing to give in to my grief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I told you not to stand so close to Noemi.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I can’t even smile. When we were children, we would joke with each other not to
                        stand so close&mdash;him, because I used to swing my braids around, sometimes clipping him in
                        the face; and me, because he had a gangly phase that put my feet in constant jeopardy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My face must crumple a little, because his own expression wavers. He smooths a
                        bolt of fabric with his hand and sets it on a shelf. “What happened?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I reach for my handkerchief, grateful there are few customers around, and then
                        unload my grief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He leans his forearms against the table as he listens, his thick eyelashes
                        blinking now and then. When I am done, my handkerchief is soaked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">From a cabinet, he pulls out a box of thin paper and places it on the table.
                        “Just got these in. Mr. Buxbaum calls them ‘disposables.’ They’re handkerchiefs you can throw
                        away. Go on, help yourself. They’re samples.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The disposables feel rough on my nose, but I am grateful they do the job. I
                        stare at the bolts of fabric. Each color occupies a different shelf. “Where would you shelve
                        me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby’s eyes sharpen, and he straightens his cuffs with quick tugs. “Don’t you
                        dare let some self-loathing, chicken-livered blueblood make you doubt yourself. You know where
                        you’re from, and I know where you’re from, and that ain’t a shelf or a country or even a place.
                        Sometimes I forget you’re even Chinese.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t.” I help myself to another disposable.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre21">“That’s ’cause you care too much about what the world
                        says. Listen to those who know you best, and you’ll be okay.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s hard to do that when the person who knew me best was lying to me this
                        whole time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If Old Gin did anything wrong, he was doing it for you.” His gaze drifts away.
                        “Does seem strange him repaying that debt now, after all these years. Billy Riggs ain’t the sort
                        to let a debt go that long. You should’ve never gone to see him. He’s so crooked, I bet his
                        bones won’t even lie flat when he’s dead in his coffin.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I half listen as my mind returns to the years toiling at the Payne Estate. It’s
                        not so much that I minded the mucking and scraping and serving, but did it have to be for that
                        family? My insides roil at the thought of Merritt’s&mdash;my <i
                            class="calibre7">brother’s</i>&mdash;constant flirting. He had admired me in a way that was
                        ungodly and immoral. Maybe I had admired him a little, too, damn my mother’s cold, unfeeling
                        heart. My stomach bucks, and I am thankful for the small mercy of not having eaten today.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You look a little green. Here, sit.” Robby pulls out a stool. “Bring you
                        water?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shake my head, knowing I won’t be able to keep anything down. Robby sweeps
                        threads into a pile with his hand. “Sometimes things fall apart so better things can come
                        together,” he says gently. “When Noemi was sacked, I thought it was going to break her. She
                        spent the whole weekend pulling lint pills off the blankets. Thought we were going to have to
                        reknit them from the piles she was making just to keep warm at night.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I still can’t smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But then Mrs. Payne wants her back. And Noemi tells her she’ll come back, but
                        only if that bicycle is five dollars, not eighty.” A chuckle floats from his mouth. “My point
                        is, a blessing loves a good disguise. And something tells me the Paynes are a stepping-stone for
                        you, not a destination, just like for that woman of mine. Hello, Mr. Buxbaum.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I didn’t even notice the shop owner walking up behind me. Trim and quick, he’s
                        the kind of man that could slip into a door before it closed and not get his coattails caught.
                        His eyebrows sit high on his forehead, giving him a look of perpetual frankness, which works in
                        his favor when it comes to doing business.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Slow morning?” he asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Just cleared out. We had a crowd earlier.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The man frowns, pressing wrinkles into his forehead. I hope he does not
                        attribute the slowness to Robby.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His gaze lands on me. “Miss Kuan, your knots are enchanting, and I think you’ll
                        see a nice profit given time.” He thumps the worktable with his fingers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you,” I say simply. The thought of making small talk exhausts me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre21">“Mrs. English dropped off a special order this morning,”
                        says Robby. “Selected the cord, too. Let me fetch it.” He glides to the register at the back
                        wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I haven’t seen Old Gin around lately. Last time I saw him, he had a nasty
                        cough. Is he over it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes. That Pendergrass . . . helped.” Billy’s steamy bathtub seeps into my
                        mind, and I fight back a grimace.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Wonderful. You know I stand behind my products.” Mr. Buxbaum’s tan-and-white
                        Balmorals squeak as he stretches high to straighten something on the shelf. His shoes are
                        shinier than Shang’s black-and-white ones. I wonder if Shang bought his here. Buxbaum’s is one
                        of the few stores that has always welcomed Chinese.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A nervous sort of energy floods through me. “Mr. Buxbaum, did you ever meet a
                        man named Shang?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The man squints, and his brow furrows like a wet book.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m not sure what he looked like, but he wore a size nine shoe. I am told he
                        moved on about seventeen years ago.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He gives me a strange look. “Of course I met him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby returns, holding a list in one hand and a box of cord in the other. He
                        hands Mr. Buxbaum the list and is about to speak, but notices that I’m about to fall off my
                        stool.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Er, you were saying, sir?” I prompt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby measures the cord against a yardstick hammered into the table, then cuts
                        it with precise snips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Shang is Old Gin’s son.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby’s scissors stop. The room spins around me, and I put a hand on the table
                        to steady myself. If Shang is Old Gin’s son, that makes Old Gin . . . my grandfather.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They worked at the Payne Estate together,” Mr. Buxbaum continues, staring at
                        the overhead fixture. “Nice young man. Liked practicing his English on me, especially the big
                        words like <i class="calibre7">glockenspiel</i>.” He beams at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I lick my lips. “Glockenspiel?” A <i class="calibre7">G</i>-word.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s a German xylophone.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby ties up my cord in neat bundles, sneaking me sympathetic looks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Once, he asked me to order a few things from China to celebrate the Chinese
                        New Year. Wanted to surprise Old Gin.” He ticks off his fingers. “Red melon seeds, joss sticks,
                        dried shrimp, and fireworks.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Fireworks?” says Robby. “What’s that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Pasteboard tubes filled with gunpowder that, when lit, produce colorful
                        sparks. Boom!” Mr. Buxbaum throws back his arms. “Looked like the stars exploding.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby grins. “I’d like to see that.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre21">“Course, he spent a day in jail for disturbing the peace,
                        but those of us who caught the show have him to thank for a spectacular night.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">More shoppers trickle into the store, drawing Mr. Buxbaum’s attention. “Old Gin
                        said he’d left to strike it rich on silver in Montana. Surprised Old Gin didn’t tell you that
                        himself.” He straightens his cravat and sets off toward the newcomers. “Don’t get too tied up in
                        your work, Miss Kuan,” he calls back over his shoulder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, sir,” I manage to croak out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A customer solicits Robby’s help, and he finishes wrapping my cord in paper.
                        “Remember what I said about things coming together.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I gulp down the lump in my throat. “Thank you, Robby.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">B<span class="calibre9">Y THE TIME </span>I slog home, a reluctant sun has begun
                        to coax life back into the streets. I try to hold on to my anger at Old Gin, but it is as
                        slippery as a fish. All this time, I have had family by my side. Memories of Old Gin flood my
                        mind, the years of patient instruction on discarded newspapers and paper cartons. Old Gin wasn’t
                        just teaching me out of duty, but devotion. Why would he not tell me that he was my grandfather?
                        Probably he knew I would ask too many questions, making it harder to keep the secret about my
                        parents.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I slip carefully into the tree entrance and close the door behind me. In the
                        basement, I step out of my boots and pull the pins from my hair, which weighs too heavily on my
                        head. With a piece of chalk, I write the word <i class="calibre7">glockenspiel</i> on my wall
                        before I forget it and, for comfort, unplug the listening tube.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Hearing nothing, I move to the stove. While I fill the tinderbox with
                        newspaper, a draft from the barn entrance blows at my face. My pulse begins to trot. It is too
                        early for Old Gin to return.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Someone is here.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Thirty-four</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">I drop the kindling, scattering branches on the floor.
                            My eyes</span> rummage the room for our new hand ax, trying to shake off my panic.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">If trouble’s coming through the barn door, I’m not running to meet it. I hurry
                        down the western corridor to the tree exit and am soon gulping in cold Atlanta air.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But now what?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Scaredy-cat. Perhaps it was an animal. Though no animal I know can open a
                        trapdoor, except perhaps a bear, and I’ve never seen a bear in Atlanta or anywhere.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Well, I’m not staying in this tree. Branches grab me as I dislodge myself less
                        gracefully than usual, then casually walk toward the street. For the first time, I actually hope
                        to see people. A pair of women with baby strollers shriek when they see me and hurry their
                        strollers away. I must look like a demon spat up from hell, unshod, my hair like a monsoon on my
                        head, and wielding an ax, no less. I would run from me, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My teeth chatter. I need to get ahold of myself. Hammer Foot would hate to see
                        me this way&mdash;afraid, and worse, stirring up fear in people around me. I quickly twist my
                        hair into a knot, and then tuck the ax under my arm. My socks have grown soggy with dew and make
                        sucking sounds as I walk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After a few more aimless paces, my fear ebbs away. The basement is our home. I
                        might have lost my job today, not to mention my belief in the steadfast nature of motherly love,
                        but I shall not give up my home without a fight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shin around to the barn entrance, the sharp gravel picking up my feet.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-210" class="calibre21">Hiding behind a snaggle of pine trees, I watch the
                        abandoned barn for movement. The exterior warns people away with its blackened walls, only half
                        standing, and caved-in roof. A margin of thistle provides a further deterrent, if you don’t note
                        the spaces to place your feet. Inside the barn, however, the beams are solid and dry, the
                        rotting wood long ago carted away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Our interloper was probably a drunk making himself at home inside the horse
                        stall, somehow finding the concealed pull that unlocks the trapdoor. Just because it never
                        happened before doesn’t mean it couldn’t. If I make profits from the knots, I shall buy a real
                        lock. Maybe one day, a home with a real locking door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mustering my courage, I tiptoe to the entrance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A moan breaks through the hush. Blood spatters the earth, like rubies on dirt.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">From the stall with our trapdoor, two skinny legs stick out. One foot is
                        missing a boot, its flannel-reinforced sole twitching like a half-dead fish.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I rush into the barn. “Old Gin!” I cry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The trapdoor is open, but he could not climb down into it. I bend over his
                        crumpled form. Blood leaks from his mouth, and red bruises puff out on his face. “Who did this
                        to you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The turtle egg,” he spits. “His man caught me on walk home.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Knucks.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin nods. He glances at an empty green bottle lying a few feet from his
                        head. “He gave me that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I set down the ax and pick it up. Pendergrass’s Long-Life Elixir.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">All feeling drains out of me, except guilt, whose sharp points stab me from all
                        angles. Billy figured out that I double-crossed him. All this over a fifty-cent bottle of barley
                        water. I think back to the day he asked me who the most important person in the world to me is.
                        Now I realize why. I bite back angry tears. “Coward. Beating up an old, defenseless man.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin grimaces. “Not so defenseless. You should see him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Despite his words, he is panting, and one eye oozes tears and blood.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s my fault. I wanted to know more about Shang. I’m sorry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His good eye dribbles over me and my ax. “When you go to chop wood, please
                        remember shoes, hm?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Where does it hurt?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who says it hurts?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hiss in exasperation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Rib might be cracked,” he concedes. “Maybe a few other things.” He clicks his
                        tongue at the tears spilling over my cheeks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Pull it together! Old Gin needs me.</i> I dash back into
                        our basement to fetch clean water for his thirst and rags for his wounds. With cooled barley
                        tea, I make a compress for his injured eye and then pick debris from his wounds. Fresh tears
                        spill out again when I view the state of his torso. Bruises cover every bit of his skin in even
                        patterns of four, marking each blow of Knucks’s brass knuckles. Old Gin has grown so thin, his
                        ribs stick out like a pair of open shutters.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-211" class="calibre21">I apply more barley-tea compresses to his bruises,
                        wishing we had pepper. Noemi said pepper solves a lot of problems you don’t expect it to,
                        including bruises. He winces as I wash his bloodied knuckles. Perhaps he did manage to inflict
                        some damage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mr. Buxbaum told me about Shang. Why didn’t you tell me the truth?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He sighs, an invisible thing more felt than seen, like water. “Some burdens are
                        too heavy for young shoulders.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Did he know about me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. That letter was the last he heard from your mother before she left for
                        Savannah.” His voice has dropped to a hush. “I’m sorry for bringing you back. I wished for a
                        bond between sisters, one that could outlast parents.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline’s shocked expression materializes before me, lit by the faintest
                        glimmer of understanding. Old Gin’s eyes flutter closed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Grandfather,” I call, feeling the cold finger of fear press against my heart.
                        “Wake up.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He doesn’t move. I fetch blankets and pillows. Under a folded blanket tucked in
                        one corner of his room, I discover the Balmorals. He never sold them. They are, after all, one
                        of the few remembrances of his son. I return to his side and arrange the bedding around him.
                        Then I hold his hand, a hand that seems to have grown smaller over the years. A hand that has
                        patiently guided me through life.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">With a gray blanket tucked around his body, he looks so frail, like an injured
                        fruit bat. My heart floods with love for Old Gin, who did the work of two people, asking nothing
                        in return. I was so mad at him, when he’s the one who changed my diapers and soothed me to
                        sleep. When I caught the influenza, he scared off the devil winds, coaxing the fire within me to
                        life with soup and his own gentle humming. He wanted me to have a sister so that when he was
                        gone, I would still have a family.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My chest begins to hiccup and pull. Not wanting Old Gin to see me cry, I duck
                        back into the basement and collapse onto my bed in a sweaty, grimy heap. I take in huge gulps of
                        air and sob and try to think of a plan. How will I get him back into the basement? Trying to
                        lower him down the metal rungs without injuring him further will be as difficult as climbing
                        down a ladder with a barrel of water. I need to find him medical attention. But how? We don’t
                        have money for a doctor, even if I could find one that would treat a Chinese man.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He will die in the abandoned barn, of cold or infection or exposure, when he
                        should be resting on the finest feather mattress, with clean sheets and cooling ice for his
                        bruises. I will need to find his boot. The thought of it lying abandoned and alone in the
                        streets somehow makes me cry even harder.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre21">I mop my face on my quilt. My eyes stick on the word <i
                            class="calibre7">grievous</i>, “shockingly cruel or brutal,” written when Mrs. Bell told
                        Nathan that the combination of whatever he had thrown on was grievous to her eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Grievous</i> is the word that fits our predicament, but I
                        am not grieving yet. There is work to be done. I will bring a warm brick to Old Gin, and then
                        find help. Creakily, I get to my feet, when another sound freezes me in place.</p>

                    <h2>Thirty-five</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">A giant snowball of fur bounces up to me, and I fall
                            back against the</span> bed. “B-B-Bear?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Woof!</i> Out rolls the pink herald of her tongue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“H-how did you&mdash;?” My eyes fly to the listening tube. In my haste to leave
                        the basement, I forgot to plug it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I reach for the wool stopper, but Nathan’s voice drifts down to me. “Where is
                        she? Must’ve gone out the window again. It’s that new cat across the street, I bet.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I stuff in the plug before Bear woofs again. She looks from the speaking tube
                        to me, and her ears lift, as if she is waiting for an explanation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, Bear,” I say, my voice shaking. She puts her head on my lap, and I swear
                        that creature knows exactly what I need. I fling my arms around her, and she doesn’t move away
                        until my sob is spent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you,” I tell her at last. “But I must get help. And Nathan will be
                        worried for you. Come.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin has not moved an inch. Bear circles him, then sits by his feet, and
                        when I make for the exit, she does not follow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Bear, come!” I slap my thigh twice the way I’ve seen Nathan do.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She looks from me to Old Gin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Come!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">This time, she lowers her belly to the ground.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Now what? Well, I can’t worry about her right now. I must get help for Old Gin.
                        But from who?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear lifts her head, watching me from somewhere under that shag.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-213" class="calibre21">No. The Bells can’t find out our secret. Old Gin had
                        strict rules, rules meant to keep us safe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Yet, somehow, I don’t think he would mind a change in the rules today.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The Bells’ front door is already open when I scramble up the porch steps.
                        Nathan emerges, shrugging on his coat. When he sees me, his face loses all its scowl lines. “Jo?
                        What are you doing here? Is everything all right?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My grandfather,” I cry as a sob amasses in my throat once more. “Billy Riggs
                        hurt him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His mother appears behind him, wiping her hands on a dishcloth. “Oh, my dear.”
                        She shoulders past him and takes my frozen hands in her slightly damp ones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Where is he?” asks Nathan. A lock of hair sticks up from his cowlick like a
                        question mark.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I will show you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Back to the abandoned barn we go. If they are worried about its dilapidated
                        appearance, they don’t show it, following right on my heels. Bear greets Nathan with a <i
                            class="calibre7">woof!</i> and bounds to his side.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ah.” He pats her head. “There’s a good girl.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell crouches next to Old Gin, her eyes grim. If she feels disgust at the
                        sight of Old Gin’s bloodied and battered form, she only tsks her tongue. “We must get Dr. Swift.
                        Nathan&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I will be back as soon as I can.” Bear and I watch him jog away, her tail
                        motoring back and forth. When Nathan disappears from view, the dog plunks herself again at Old
                        Gin’s feet, protecting her injured lamb.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I take Old Gin’s hand again, placing myself on the side opposite Mrs. Bell. She
                        still carries her dish towel, and there’s a streak of flour on her cheek. “Don’t worry, Jo.” She
                        knows my name. “Dr. Swift is quite skilled and lives up to his name. He’ll have your grandfather
                        fixed in no time.” She arranges herself in a more comfortable position, knees tucked under her,
                        the hem of her herringbone skirt picking up the dirt of the barn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Could I fetch you something to sit on?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, thank you. But, er, how would you do that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She follows my gaze to the open trapdoor. A question lodges itself between her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I take a deep breath. Then I tell her about our life downstairs. She does not
                        flinch at my recounting or recoil or do any of the things one would expect from someone who has
                        just discovered there are more than rats in her basement. Instead, she sits calmly listening,
                        arms knotted into her marigold shawl.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin’s eye has started to bleed again, and I wring out another barley
                        compress, my own head a strange brew of helplessness, gratefulness, and shame. Now that we are
                        discovered, I can’t expect the Bells to lie to their landlords. “I am sorry, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre21">Her gaze drifts to Old Gin. “Sometimes, I get dyspepsia
                        and have trouble sleeping. I wander through the house, trying to get my stomach to settle. Many
                        years ago, I swore I’d hear a young girl’s voice now and then whenever I’d go into the print
                        shop.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I swallow hard, remembering the nights I’d fallen asleep to the lullaby of the
                        printing press. Maybe I talked in my sleep.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A smile forms on her face. “Mr. Bell told me it was probably the indigestion
                        giving me gas. Have you been hearing . . . us?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nod guiltily. “But not all the time. Just sometimes, when I need to.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She presses her hands over her crestfallen expression.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“And only in the print shop,” I add hastily. “That’s where the abolitionists
                        built the speaking tube.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Abolition&mdash;” The word breaks off. She carefully shifts into a
                        cross-legged position. “I wish I had figured it out earlier. I had seen you and your grandfather
                        a few times before, and thought you must have lived around here. When the solicitor’s wife told
                        me about the Chinese girl in the hat shop, well, I was curious about you, but I still couldn’t
                        work out why you were so familiar to me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I wipe my leaky eyes on my palm. She reaches over Old Gin and takes my wet hand
                        in her warm one. “And at last, when Nathan told me you were our Miss Sweetie, I thought, well,
                        of course. That girl is destined to be in our lives.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“So, you’re not upset?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No.” There are tears in her eyes. “I am relieved.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The next half hour passes quickly as I answer Mrs. Bell’s questions about how
                        Old Gin and I came to be living under her house. I tell her the truth about my relationship with
                        Mrs. Payne. Now that the worst has happened, there is no reason to hide. Either that or I am too
                        tired to think of one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sounds of clopping hooves and grinding wheels hasten toward us. Then a
                        bear-size man with a grizzled beard appears in the doorway, smelling of cigars and swinging a
                        large carpetbag. He takes one look at Mrs. Bell’s and my tear-streaked faces and says, “Hope I’m
                        not too late.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell pushes herself to her feet. “No, Doctor. But please hurry.”</p>

                    <h2>Thirty-six</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">From the outside, the Bells’ two-story house features
                            cheerful</span> curtains in its white-framed windows. Two potted cypresses stand guard on
                        either side of a stout brown door. I always imagined Mrs. Bell kept her house the way she
                        dressed&mdash;plain and neat. But while the house is neat, its contents are like a field of
                        wildflowers to my eyes. Knitted throws in whimsical colors like meadow green and tulip pink
                        drape the couch and two fireside chairs. A bucolic landscape pieced from cheerful feed sacks has
                        been stretched onto a wooded frame and hung on the wall. Braided rugs stitched with a stout
                        needle cause each footfall to feel lovingly supported. There’s even a tufted cushion on the
                        floor by the fireplace, perfectly sheepdog-size.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After Dr. Swift patched up the worst of the injuries, including Old Gin’s eye,
                        Nathan helped him cart Old Gin to the Bells’ front door. We did not find the boot; it was
                        probably already picked up by a street urchin. The men carried Old Gin into a spare bedroom on
                        the first story with a view of the street, and laid him upon a mattress made of ticking with
                        sheets that look freshly ironed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Dr. Swift rolls his sleeves back down. “Elevate his back. It’ll make it easier
                        to breathe with that punctured lung. We must pray that infection does not set in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I help Mrs. Bell tuck pillows behind Old Gin’s back and under his knees. “What
                        about his eye?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Keep it clean and be thankful the good Lord gave us two.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My toes grip the floor extra hard. Oh God, please save his eye. A sympathetic
                        noise feathers from Mrs. Bell’s mouth.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-215" class="calibre21">The doctor takes a bottle of antiseptic from his bag and
                        sets it on a dresser, along with a blue vial. “This tincture will help with the pain, though
                        start small&mdash;a teaspoon or two. I never gave it to a yellow man before, but I expect he’ll
                        tolerate it like the rest of us. He needs two months of rest and good soup. How’s he at chess?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Chinese or American, if he loses, it’s on purpose,” I say weakly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Really. Well then, maybe it’s time for the old horse to learn a new trick.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Maybe it’s the way the last of the sunlight falls when Nathan adjusts the
                        shutters, but despite the news about his eye, I swear a smile ghosts around Old Gin’s face. I
                        hope he knows he’s in the best of hands. Not quite home, but home just the same.</p>

                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">M<span class="calibre9">RS</span>. B<span class="calibre9">ELL GIVES </span>me a
                        rice-root brush and then shows me to a washroom on the first floor. “Take your time. I will
                        prepare dinner.” She leaves, and soon I hear the <i class="calibre7">clang</i> of a pot meeting
                        a stove.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The washroom matches the size of my basement corner and contains a bin of
                        towels, a basin, and a catching tub, meant for the dribbles from washing and rinsing. Another
                        door conveniently leads to the garden, where used water can be deposited, and an outhouse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I glance into a looking glass, and my own face scares me, my eyes painfully
                        loud, my mouth chewed up with worry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan brings two buckets of steaming water, which he sets by the catching tub.
                        He edges past me to the doorway, as if he is suddenly conscious of the close quarters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I could fill the tub if you don’t mind waiting.” He takes in my matted hair,
                        maybe wondering if he’ll be boiling water all night.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“This is more than enough. Thank you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Jo, I just wanted to say, I’m sorry about your grandfather, but I’m glad
                        you’re here. I couldn’t stand . . .” He grips the doorframe, and his gray eyes are not sure
                        where to land. “Er, I should let you get on with it.” He winces and then closes the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My limbs ache, but I make every drop of water count, scrubbing my skin with a
                        washcloth until it turns pink. My discovery this morning seems a lifetime ago. Who knew so many
                        moments could happen in the span of one day? I will need to inform the Paynes of what happened,
                        though the thought of going back blows more smoke on my mood.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Did she ever love me?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I never loved her, only the idea of her. I dreamed of having a mother like Mrs.
                        Payne, someone with a smile in her eyes and a song on her lips. Someone who smelled like summer
                        peaches. What a fool she has played me for these seventeen years. I detest the woman. Maybe even
                        more than Billy Riggs.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre21">I take my anger out on my tangled tresses, washing,
                        rinsing, and detangling until the mass gleams like spilled ink over my shoulders. Then I station
                        myself by Old Gin, watching every rise and fall of his bony chest. Mrs. Bell brings me a bowl of
                        stew to eat while I watch him. It is good stew, with silky bits of potato and carrot, but I can
                        only eat a few bites as my stomach knots with worry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell pokes her head back in, and I carry my half-finished bowl out of the
                        room to talk with her. “Thank you, ma’am. I will finish the rest later. You must let me take
                        care of the dishes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I won’t hear of it. Would you like to borrow one of my Mother Hubbards?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That is kind of you, but I need to return to the basement for a few things.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan, carrying a stack of newspapers through the house, stops. “Will you let
                        me accompany you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The idea of letting him look into the private corners of my life makes my
                        stomach as jumpy as a hundred dried beans being poured on a pie tin. But all my life, haven’t I
                        been the one looking in on him? “I would like that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After he takes the papers to the burn pile, he returns with a kerosene lamp. I
                        shake my head. It’s one thing for the Bells to know about our home in their basement, but I
                        wouldn’t like others to find out. “I will lead you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The night is blacker than usual with no moon to light the way. I slip my hand
                        into Nathan’s so as to lead him, grateful to the dark for hiding the wildfire blazing across my
                        face. Together, we move quietly to the abandoned barn, which is easier to negotiate than the
                        Virginia cedar. We climb down the rungs, engulfed by that familiar scent of earth and magnolia
                        roots. When I light the kerosene lamp we keep in the western corridor, his breath shushes out of
                        him. I carry the lamp down the corridor, seeing our quarters as if for the first time with him
                        treading breathlessly beside me. When we reach our living area, my chest puffs with pride over
                        the tidy little home Old Gin and I have built here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I collect my nightgown and underthings while he roams the room, taking in the
                        stove, the spool table, even crouching to inspect the rug. He crosses to my corner. His
                        incredulous eyes rove from my embroidered curtains, to my small bed, to my wooden-crate
                        nightstand supporting a dictionary and a candle. Then to the <i class="calibre7">G</i>-words,
                        growing both more complex and neater in penmanship the higher up the wall extends. Two words
                        catch his eye. “Giddy goobers,” he reads.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pull the wool stopper from the listening tube. Moving slowly, he lowers
                        himself onto my bed, then puts his ear to the hole. No words drop out. No one is in the print
                        shop. “You must have heard quite a bit growing up.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-217" class="calibre21">“Well, yes.” I cough, struck with the sudden urge to pull
                        the embroidered curtain around me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His gaze spreads over the room again, and he presses a fist to his chin. “This
                        is your Avalon.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Avalon?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s what Bear and I call our secret hideaway, named after King Arthur’s
                        magical island. There now, seems you didn’t know everything about me.” His eyes invite me to
                        laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Your family taught me so many words. If I had lived under, say, a goat herder,
                        I might never have been Miss Sweetie.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You do an injury to goats. I heard they recite Shakespeare when no one’s
                        watching.” He puts a hand to his heart and says grandly, “‘To bleat or not to bleat, that is the
                        question.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I let out a tiny smile and squeeze my bundle of clothes. “Cud you . . . find it
                        in your heart to forgive me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He smiles. “Thanks to Miss Sweetie, my heart may never be the same.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It is hard to read him in the dim light. But of course, these are words of
                        admiration, not love, or why else use Miss Sweetie’s name? The sentiment ripens like fruit,
                        fruit from a tree I cannot touch. I ignore how the shadows conspire to pull me closer to him. He
                        draws nearer as well, but cautiously, as if afraid to break anything.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I would like to get some fresh socks for Old Gin’s feet,” I announce.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Er, of course.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nothing like the word <i class="calibre7">feet</i> to break a spell.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He clears his throat. “Tomorrow, I would like to file a police report on Old
                        Gin’s assault.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I&mdash;I don’t think he would like that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why not?” A frown mars his smooth cheeks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Because we do not trust certain things.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His face asks more, but it is difficult to explain a lifetime of wariness.
                        Justice and fairness are for other people, umbrellas that open only for certain heads. The
                        Chinese just try to stay out of the rain, and if we are caught in a downpour, we make do,
                        knowing that the rain will not last forever.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Do you . . . trust me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes.”</p>

                    <h2>Thirty-seven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Nathan offers his chambers, but just the thought brings
                            a blush to</span> my cheeks. Anyway, I would rather sleep in the room with Old Gin in case
                        he needs something. Mrs. Bell lays a thick rug and several quilts on the floor, which coax me to
                        sleep sooner than I expect.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I wake with a start to the sound of Old Gin coughing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sunlight seems too bright, even filtered through the cracks in the
                        shutters. I rise and bring water to Old Gin’s lips. He’s wearing a flannel nightshirt I haven’t
                        seen before. One of Nathan’s? I adjust the pillows around him, wondering if he needs to make
                        water. But he slumps back, somehow managing to look smaller and more injured than yesterday. His
                        wounded eye is now the size of a baby’s fist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell pokes her head in and I follow her out of the room, closing the door
                        behind me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good morning, Mrs. Bell. I’m sorry to oversleep. Has he had his medicine?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, this morning, and then Nathan helped him use the outhouse.” She wipes her
                        hands on an apron embroidered with fruits, her premature white hair neatly whorled into a bun at
                        her neck. “You were sleeping so soundly. We didn’t want to disturb you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you. Is Nathan&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He’s delivering one of our jobs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My eyes fall to today’s copy of the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i> on the
                        kitchen table. Nathan titled the Miss Sweetie column about the streetcars “I Know How to Sit.”
                        He must have been up all night running the press.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre21">“I must go. The Paynes will be wondering where Old Gin
                        is.” Troubles are like weeds, and the longer you avoid them, the bigger they grow. Might as well
                        give this one a good yank now before it can do more damage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">T<span class="calibre9">HE SPRING DRAGON </span>roars, its breath reeking of cut
                        grass and pollen. I trudge down the gilded corridor of Peachtree, wearing Old Gin’s cap and
                        carrying my borrowed bonnet in a gunnysack. I never thought of Mrs. Payne’s hat as mine, and
                        that makes it easier to surrender. Maybe that is how Mrs. Payne felt about me&mdash;only
                        borrowed as needed. With rising costs, it is easy to give me back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My outrage at the woman has mellowed into something duller but somehow more
                        painful, a gnaw versus a bite. Hammer Foot taught us that standing in another’s shoes is good
                        for our own postures, but today, I can barely manage to stand in my own.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin’s cap sags over my ears. They will have to bring in a replacement,
                        though they will never get anyone as capable as Old Gin. A good groom is hard to find, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The biscuit Mrs. Bell insisted I eat has cooled in my stomach by the time I
                        turn into the Paynes’ driveway. There is a haunting stillness to the property, the same kind
                        that creeps over an old battleground, never quite achieving peace. Since I am no longer employed
                        here, I knock on the front door instead of rounding the courtyard to the kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae answers, her reedlike figure more stooped than yesterday. Her sigh
                        seems to sink through to the floor. She knew, too. Has she pitied me all these years? What other
                        burdens has she carried?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How long have you known?” I try to keep the bitterness from my voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I carried you to Old Gin’s shanty. You were just a peanut.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You?” I croak. A younger version of the housekeeper moving with purpose toward
                        the row of ramshackle dwellings fills my mind. Was she trying to protect her mistress, or me? Or
                        simply the fragile state of the house she kept tidy for so long?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It was for the best. Mr. Payne ordered your mama to send you to an orphanage.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“So he knew about”&mdash;the shameful words stick&mdash;“the affair.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He knew about the dalliance in the cemetery.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The cemetery?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The papers got wind of it, but Mr. Payne made sure the story didn’t mention
                        your mama.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">All my blood seems to pool in my stomach. “My father was the Rabid-Eyes
                        Rapist?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre21">“That’s what they called him. But your father was not a
                        rapist. They were foolish, but they were in love.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Poor Shang. He was never fingered for the supposed crime, but another man paid
                        for it with his life. The injustice of it all makes me want to lay waste to the whole of
                        Peachtree Street with one fiery breath. “Does Mr. Payne know I’m her daughter?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. Your mama told him the baby was a boy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She is clever, that much is undeniable. Something tells me he might have
                        figured it out anyway. Yet, the man had always been decent to me. Maybe that was a chain he
                        chose to wear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi appears beside Etta Rae. A fresh sprig of bluebells adorns her apron, and
                        she’s holding a jar of pickles. “Thought it was you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It is hard to look into her concerned eyes and keep my composure. She drapes an
                        arm around my shoulders and gives me a sideways squeeze. “Robby told me what happened, and Etta
                        Rae filled in a few other details.” Her gaze floats to Old Gin’s cap. “Why are you here?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I need to talk to her. Old Gin’s not well. He won’t be coming for a while.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Etta Rae clucks her tongue. “She’s in the stable.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi pulls me inside. “I’ll walk you there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The house feels cold and disapproving, each clap of my footfalls a rebuke. I
                        glance up the staircase but see no movement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi notices. “Caroline went with her father to the mill. How about that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“And Merritt?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He went, too.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">At least I won’t have to face him. It is grievous that the thought of seeing
                        one’s brother should make one so ill. The scent of vinegar in the kitchen almost comes as a
                        relief. Jars line the window, filled with an assortment of vegetables.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We set off toward the stables, Noemi’s arm looped through mine. Unlike the
                        front of the estate, the back moves with activity, men lifting potted plants off a wagon in the
                        courtyard, trimming trees, and painting fences. Merritt’s broken engagement will not stop the
                        post-race merrymaking. Scandal loves a good distraction.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi cuts her gaze to me. “Now, what happened to Old Gin? He never misses
                        work.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Billy Riggs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her arm stiffens. “What about Billy Riggs?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I tell her, and when I am done, she issues a loud <i class="calibre7">hmph</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“This time, I’m really going to hit him with the Book.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Who?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre21">“My no-account brother.” A worker rolling a wheelbarrow
                        of pinecones tips his hat toward us, but Noemi sees right through him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You’re going to read him the Bible?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, I’m going to hit him with it. He might not get up for days. What was he
                        thinking, sending that smelly corpse to beat up an old man? He’s out of control.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I&mdash;I don’t understand. Your brother knows Billy?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She sighs. “My brother <i class="calibre7">is</i> Billy.”</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Thirty-eight</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">My shock falls out. “B-b-b-b&mdash;”</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Billy’s father stuck Mama with a baby before I came along, but that’s a story
                        for another day,” Noemi says, not breaking her pace. “When Billy came out fair as a lily,
                        Billy’s father stole him from Mama to school in his vile family business. Billy only tolerates
                        my preaching ’cause he knows I got something on him. If people thought he had a little color in
                        him, he’d be rotting in jail right now, not clinking glasses with the mayor.” She casts a patch
                        of dandelion a look so grim, I expect the blooms to whiten and blow away right in front of us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi’s mother had been one-quarter colored, though many here considered a
                        single drop of African blood enough to damn a lineage. It’s like how Mrs. English would never
                        use an ostrich plume with a gray spot on one of her top-shelf hats, even though the feathers
                        naturally came speckled. And with the push for new segregation laws, now is not a good time to
                        have a gray spot, especially for one who has already made his share of enemies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The thought that I have something in common with Billy&mdash;both of us passing
                        in our own way&mdash;makes my teeth ache. “I’m sorry, but even if he is your brother, I can’t
                        forgive him. I spent last night plotting out ways to make him suffer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She nods. “Tonight, we’re gonna pay him a visit. I’ll hold him down while you
                        give him your best shot.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Okay.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As for Mrs. Payne, I own you deserve a lot better than her.” A crow lands on
                        the ground in front of us, and Noemi lunges toward it, growling. The crow flaps away with a
                        squawk, and she continues on her way. “But each of our personal roads got crows on them. With
                        every crow we meet, we get better at shooing them away, the filthy flying rats. And guess what’s
                        at the end of the road?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre21">“Pearly gates?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She tsks her tongue. “Not that road, that’s on a different map. Vic-to-ry.” She
                        cuts the word into pieces and savors every syllable. “I wasn’t too keen to get on that
                        slick-looking August at first. But now that I know how, I’m riding him to the finish line.
                        Victory. Do you understand me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. What is this victory?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s knowing your worth no matter what the crows tell you. Victory is waiting
                        for us. We have to be bold enough to snatch it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her words swirl around my head, white and fuzzy, like the pollen-filled air
                        around me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The stable is more cluttered than normal, with piles of rope waiting to be
                        wound and gear scattered about the floor. Mr. Crycks fits a headstall over one of the horses.
                        The man knocks his hat back an inch and squints at me, flat mouth working at something. He’s not
                        much for words.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato whickers a hello from her stall, head bobbing up and down, telling
                        me to come closer. She wants a taste of Old Gin’s hat, no doubt, and I give it to her to chew.
                        She drops it onto the floor. Maybe things that come easy are not as good.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne emerges from a stall a few spaces down. “Jo?” Her thick shawl covers
                        her poplin dress. No hint of yesterday’s emotions remains on her face. She is back to the
                        well-bred lady of the manor I grew up knowing&mdash;or not knowing. Perfectly aligned spine,
                        gaze soft but unreadable, hands loosely cupped like magnolia blossoms by her side. “What are you
                        doing here? And where is Old Gin?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He is in a bad way after being attacked yesterday on his way home. The doctor
                        has recommended two months of rest.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne works at her wedding band. “Oh my Lord. Who attacked him?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Billy Riggs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“The fixer?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes.” I wonder if she has any idea of the trouble my father got himself into
                        on her account.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Jed Crycks crosses his arms and spits. “The swine. He should be tarred and
                        feathered.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I make a noise of agreement, though that would be a waste of good chicken
                        feathers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I wanted to discuss the matter of Sweet Potato with you,” I tell Mrs. Payne.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sweet Potato?” she asks distractedly.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-222" class="calibre21">Jed leads his horse out of the barn with a click of his
                        tongue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne gestures at a nest of rope. “Noemi, wind that before someone trips.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi looks relieved at having something to do. “Certainly, ma’am.” She hunkers
                        down on a milking stool and sets to the task.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hand Mrs. Payne my gunnysack. “Your hat,” I inform her before she can wonder
                        whether there’s a dead animal inside. “We have paid up through the month of March for Sweet
                        Potato’s stable and board. I will need access to your property so that I may take her for
                        exercise. Do I have your permission?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She seems taken aback by my businesslike tone. “That sounds reasonable.”
                        Wearily, she watches me through those watery eyes, which today are not lake blue or river gray
                        or any of the colors I’ve seen before, but a murky bog of uneven depth. I no longer care to
                        figure her out. I’ve spent my whole life trying to read those eyes, when all this time, they
                        were a steel fortress intended to keep me out. Perhaps what I’ve been seeing all this time was
                        my own stubborn reflection.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Was there anything else?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Given Old Gin’s condition, he will be unable to race Sweet Potato this
                        Saturday.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Of course.” She frowns. “The suffragists will protest. I might need to bring
                        another horse and rider. That, or hire a militia.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi, who has managed to blend into the scenery, lets her rope go slack. I
                        never told her about Old Gin racing, much less being paired with the suffragists. Her fidgety
                        pupils snap to mine. She makes shoving motions with her hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">What?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Now she’s pretending to ride a horse, lasso and all. She stops riding and
                        stretches up her fists, and then points at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Victory is waiting for us. We have to be bold enough to
                            snatch it.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato puts her nose into my hand. An image of Old Gin weaving her
                        through a throng of moving horses sprints through my mind. Despite Billy’s savage attack on Old
                        Gin, no doubt he will still press us for the three-hundred-dollar debt, and though the chances
                        of me crossing the finish line first are slim to none, at least it is a chance. Plus, I could
                        show those suffragists who’s an American woman. And Mrs. Payne could see for herself what I’m
                        made of, something that goes beyond flesh and blood.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But a nobody like me has no business on the track, let alone in the biggest
                        horse race Atlanta has ever seen. It’s probably illegal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin believed he could do it. He would believe in me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne has opened the gunnysack and smooths the camel felt with her hand.
                        “Well, please give Old Gin our best&mdash;”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-223" class="calibre21">“Of course, Sweet Potato will still be racing,” I hear
                        myself say. My heart begins to squirm around in my chest. Noemi grins and holds her hands
                        tightly in prayer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne stops fiddling with the hat. The sunlight sifting through the
                        rafters draws lines like prison bars on her face. “Oh? Who will be her jockey?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I stamp down a foot and imagine an entire flock of crows scattering before me.
                        “Me.”</p>

                            fooled with stuff she don’t know about. Then she told me I’m the one who’s stunted. How can

                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Even the horses fall silent at my proclamation. Mrs.
                            Payne’s mouth</span> hangs half open in shock. “You.” She shakes herself free of her stupor.
                        “I’m sorry. It wouldn’t be proper.” Maybe hearing the hypocrisy in her words, she adds, “Not to
                        mention unsafe, not just for you, but the other horses and riders.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I stroke Sweet Potato’s sleek nose. “You can avoid a protest.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre21">“Those suffragists will protest regardless.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Not if I win.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She snorts, and the sound squares my jaw. But she is glaring at a knot in the
                        floor, and I wonder if her reaction is more complicated than I think.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi finishes tying her rope and busily stacks pails. “Remember that
                        baby-eating spider, ma’am,” she casually drops. “Controversy sells.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne straightens a halter hanging askew on a nail. It flops to one side
                        again, and she shakes her head. Before she can refuse me, I put the final feather in the cap.
                        “Plus, I have been told there is horse-riding in my blood.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The statement stamps a hoof before her, daring her to turn away. It is the
                        first acknowledgment of our shared lineage, a final choice between pride and shame. Her choice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her chin becomes a small fist. “I will add you to the roster.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you. And one more thing. I trust there will be no unmasking of Miss
                        Sweetie. Seems she is not the only one wearing a mask.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She coughs. The dust seems to hold its pattern around her, until at last, she
                        nods. “I understand.”</p>

                        doubt myself all over again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">There will be professional jockeys in the ring, men who know all the tricks.
                        The only trick I know is the one where you pull up your knees and pivot in the saddle, but that
                        one’s not going to speed me to the finish any faster.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Returning to the estate, I kiss Sweet Potato’s face and hand her to Mr. Crycks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Only his door-knocker mustache moves when he talks. “Tell Old Gin to come back
                        before Sweet Potato decides she likes me better.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Will do, Mr. Crycks. Thank you for watching after her. See you tomorrow.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I return to the Bells’, Old Gin stares dreamily out the open window.
                        There’s a slow but steady limp to his breathing. On the nightstand, a half-empty cup of tea
                        weighs down a copy of today’s <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>. He doesn’t seem to notice me, even
                        when I kneel in front of him. Bear sits patiently at attention next to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s the tincture,” whispers Mrs. Bell, pulling a basket from under the bed.
                        “I used it once when my arthritis was bad, and it really sets your mind to sail. But at least he
                        won’t be feeling too much pain.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-225" class="calibre21">I touch his arm to assure him that I am here. “Sweet
                        Potato says hello, and so does Mr. Crycks, Daylily, Portia, Charlie-Sam, Bullet, and Justice.
                        Pirate, Frederick, Ameer, and Liberty Bell are out working.” His good eye wanders to me and then
                        closes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I follow Mrs. Bell to the parlor, leaving the door to Old Gin’s room open in
                        case he wakes. A chambray couch with worn arms cradles us comfortably. She sorts through her
                        basket, which contains knitted caps. Bear noses through the basket, too. “Does Old Gin favor any
                        particular color?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I’m about to choose a buckskin-brown one. We’ve always worn only plain colors
                        so we don’t stand out. But Old Gin won’t be standing out or even standing up anytime soon. I bet
                        he’d like the orange one. Once, a woman gave him an orange as a tip for escorting her jittery
                        horse across the tracks. After we slowly consumed the “noble fruit,” he declared it even better
                        than the mandarins he remembered in China. “Orange, please. I’ve never seen so many beautiful
                        yarns.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My family are farmers. We own lots of sheep.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear woofs, and Mrs. Bell pats her on the head. “Yes, you could’ve been chasing
                        after those smelly puffballs instead of roughing it with us here in the city.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mrs. Bell, you must let me take care of the house chores while we stay here. I
                        can do everything except, well, cook. But even with that, if you could direct me, I’m a quick
                        learner.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“We never noticed smoke from your stove. What did you eat?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Black-eyed peas and things that could be steeped. We only used our stove when
                        your fireplace was lit.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How could you tell?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Easy. The exhaust pipe would get warm.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“What about light?” She draws out an orange cap with white stripes, and sets it
                        on a side table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Lenses built into the walls. From the outside, they’re hidden by the boxwood.
                        Old Gin cleared them from time to time of leaves and dirt.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her smile pulls her face into delicate wrinkles. “I would love a proper tour.
                        First, there is someone I would like you to meet.” She rises stiffly, then makes for a door in
                        the wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The door to the print shop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Inside, Nathan and Mr. Bell hover over their desk, <i class="calibre7">the</i>
                        desk, which looks wonderfully old yet strong, and on whose back hundreds of thousands of words
                        have been written. While the sight of the publisher pours a thrill down my spine, so does simply
                        standing in this room. I inhale the iron-y smell of the press, the ink, and burnt cedar, which
                        all together smell like creativity and progress. The sight of the ventilation in the wall, so
                        cunningly designed as to be barely noticeable, squeezes a gasp from me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-226" class="calibre21">“None of the players will talk to us.” Mr. Bell’s
                        extra-large voice carries easily to us across the floorboards. “They all signed exclusives with
                        the <i class="calibre7">Constitution</i>. If only we had an angle.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ah, there she is,” says Nathan, straightening.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Bell stands the same height as his son, though he is thicker in build and
                        more emphatic in expression. A knitted cap hugs his rather lumpy head. He removes the spectacles
                        from the end of his ponderous nose and tucks them into the pocket of his linen coat. In four
                        strides, we are face-to-face, his good ear cocked slightly toward me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Peering at me through bloodshot brown eyes, he rubs the stubble on his chin,
                        maybe working out what to say. My nerves lick the back of my neck. He must have just arrived on
                        the morning train. “So, Mrs. Payne’s illegitimate Chinese daughter has been living under the
                        house all these years.” The statement echoes in the room, with its lack of furniture or rugs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sir, I am sorry for all the . . . inconvenience.” A more accurate word would
                        be <i class="calibre7">upheaval</i>. “My grandfather and I are in your debt. Please be assured
                        we will pay you back as soon as we can.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He makes a brushing motion with his hand, as if shooing my words away. “We are
                        the ones in your debt. Subscriptions have reached&mdash;” He glances at Nathan.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Almost two thousand two hundred,” Nathan nearly crows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My breath falls out of me. And still one week left in March.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Maybe I should leave more often.” He hikes his belt up over his midsection,
                        but it slides back down. “Course, I’m not sure I could keep up with all the houseguests.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Apologize for that, George.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I am sorry. You and your grandfather are certainly welcome in our home.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The mail slot opens, and a letter sails through, skidding on the floor until it
                        lands beside a feed sack full of more letters. Nathan retrieves it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Bell begins to pace, arms held behind his back. “You don’t look like a
                        rabble-rouser. Yet, I understand you’ve stirred up quite a fizz.” He stops pacing and shoves his
                        gaze at me. “Any other surprises I should know about?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Well, actually . . .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The whole room grows ears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You wanted an angle on the horse race, and I have one. There is to be a
                        thirteenth contestant. Me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan and his father respond at the same time. “<i class="calibre7">You?</i>”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It was supposed to be Old Gin on our horse, Sweet Potato.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The letter Nathan is holding crunches in his fist. “This is madness.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre21">His father harrumphs. “Dangerous place, the track. Saw a
                        horse take a bad fall on a sprint a few years back and had to be put down.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Don’t scare the girl.” Mrs. Bell puts a warm hand on my arm. “Jo, it’s true
                        the racetrack is no place for beginners.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I know. But Old Gin wouldn’t have entered her if he didn’t think she was as
                        good as the others.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan’s eyebrows tighten. “It’s not your . . . Wait, your horse is a <i
                            class="calibre7">mare</i>? The deuce&mdash;sorry, Mother&mdash;it’s not your <i
                            class="calibre7">mare</i> that we’re worried about.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I can assure you that I am an experienced rider.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Is it the money you need? Does Billy Riggs have something over you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“George. Now would be a good time to ask her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ask me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Bell hitches up his belt again. “Yes, well, we could use some help here,
                        though pay wouldn’t be much to start. Of course, room and board would be included for you and
                        your grandfather, either here in the house or, er, downstairs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Though perhaps a few improvements are in order if the latter,” says Mrs. Bell.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">All the words collect at my door, waiting for it to open. “You, you are
                        offering me a job?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan holds himself stiffly by the elbows. “Yes. In addition to the Miss
                        Sweetie column, you could assist with typesetting and research.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But wouldn’t we be breaking the law? People would think I was white.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Bell sweeps up a finger. “I’d wager most of the agony aunts are actually
                        agony uncles. People don’t care who it is, as long as the advice is good.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Maybe one day”&mdash;Nathan glances at his father&mdash;“you could write
                        columns under your own name.” Mr. Bell’s jaw loosens, and Nathan quickly adds, “It is clear she
                        is a good writer, not to mention more than a little knowledgeable about what goes on here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Well, girl, what do you think?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I think that’s . . .” My throat constricts, siphoning off words. “This is too
                        generous of you.” The idea that one day people might read Jo Kuan’s thoughts and viewpoints in
                        print whirs the pages of my mind. I never imagined someone like me could be permitted to write
                        using <i class="calibre7">my</i> name, but perhaps when you live in a basement, you get used to
                        a low ceiling. The Bells are willing to take a risk on me, so why hesitate?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The mail slot opens again, and a gloved hand stuffs in another letter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell presses her hands together. “You would be a help to me in the home as
                        well. With every year, it seems my joints get rustier.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-228" class="calibre21">Three pairs of hopeful eyes press into me. Here is the
                        family that I always wanted, wanting me back. I swallow down my emotions before they leak out of
                        my face. “I will need to talk it over with Old Gin.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Bell nods. “Certainly, your grandfather must be consulted.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As for the horse race, I’m afraid it is something I have to do.” Nathan’s eyes
                        pick a fight with me, but I study the tight weave of Mrs. Bell’s shawl. A community is like that
                        shawl, and once you are a part of it, you tie your fate to the threads closest to you. Would I
                        be creating a hardship for the Bells if I raced? If something were to happen to me, the Bells
                        would feel obligated to take care of me, just like with Old Gin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan pins his elbows to his side. His father’s face tightens around the
                        mouth, the look of one reining in words. It is Mrs. Bell who lifts her voice. “The path to
                        progress has never been without risk, whether that path be a march for the vote or an
                        eight-furlong stretch. Jo, if you feel you can do this, we are behind you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Bell lets out a long breath. “I don’t know, Laney, if she were my
                        daughter&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If she were your daughter, you would be stitching the number on her saddle pad
                        yourself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t even know how to sew,” he grumbles, but he doesn’t dispute her
                        statement. “Well, you’ve certainly given us an angle. Nathan, maybe you can even
                        draw&mdash;wait, where are you going?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan grabs his coat and his Homburg from the wall hook and then, without
                        glancing back, strides out the shop door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I bet I know exactly where he’s going.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin has begun to stir, so I feed him some broth. Then I coax Bear from the
                        room, bringing the used bowl to the kitchen, where Mrs. Bell is taking tea. “May I take Bear for
                        a walk?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’m sure she would love that. The leash is by the door.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I tuck my braid under Old Gin’s cap, which I’ve taken to wearing out. Then I
                        attach Bear’s leash to her collar. The afternoon sun heats the grass in front of the Bell
                        residence, putting a sour tickle in my nose. Lowering myself to Bear’s level, I comb the hair
                        out of her eyes. I might not know where Nathan went, but she does.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Okay, Bear, take me to Avalon.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Woof.</i> She licks me on the nose. Then with a flick of
                        her head, as if to say let’s go, she sets off.</p>

                    <h2>Forty</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Bear leads me north along a street full of shotgun
                            houses, long</span> dwellings whose inside doorways line up so you could fire a shot through
                        the front and out the back without hitting any walls. Of course, I don’t know why anyone would
                        want to do that, but not everything in Atlanta comes with an explanation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After a mile of walking, the houses thin and the landscape grows scraggly,
                        gangs of trees edging out the sky. The sound of running water strums along to the honks of
                        passing geese. I begin to wonder whether Bear knows where she’s going or whether she’s just
                        happy to be on the prowl. “Where’s Nathan, Bear? I hope we’re going to Avalon because I’m
                        getting bunions on my bunions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Just as I’m about to call off the search, she dives into a screen of brush so
                        tangled, I couldn’t throw a shoe through it without it bouncing back. I push aside the brush and
                        find that it gives easier than it looks. I follow Bear up a small incline.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Below, a rocky stream about forty feet across runs with clear water. A flattish
                        rock in the shape of a newsboy cap lies midstream. Nathan sits at the lip of the cap, feet
                        dangling over the water, a book open on his lap.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Woof!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Nathan looks up, and his Homburg scans from side to side. He closes the book
                        and gets to his feet. Bear bounds down to the stream and zigzags over a series of rocks to reach
                        him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hello,” I call over the water. “So, this is Avalon.” With the tree line
                        obscuring the road and the hills beyond, it is hard to recognize this as part of Atlanta.
                        Lacelike ferns brush at my face, and the cool air smells sweet and green.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre21">Nathan embraces his dog and rubs her on the neck. “I
                        don’t know whether to be impressed or . . .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Depressed.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A reluctant smile peeks out from the shadow of his hat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I lift my skirts and hop onto the first rock.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, stay there, I’ll come&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The second rock is only a fist-size bump, so I quickly step to the third, then
                        fourth, and then&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, not that one!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The last rock wobbles, and my boot begins to slip, but I leap onto Nathan’s
                        rock. With a curse, he catches me by the arm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I don’t fall easily,” I tell him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He doesn’t release my arm, and my heart flops around like a landed fish. “I
                        don’t fall easily either,” he says quietly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Giddy goobers, suddenly I don’t feel so sure-footed at all.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He lets go his grip, but the warmth of it still makes my arm tingle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It’s not much.” He sweeps an arm to the far end of the rock. “As you can see,
                        the magic apple trees are not yet in season. Care to sit on my couch?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I carefully lower myself to the lip of the newsboy-cap rock. “The unicorn
                        tapestries are a nice touch.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you. I do the decorating myself.” He points to a depression a few feet
                        from where we are sitting. “There is where Excalibur was forged. Er, that’s a sword.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I know. Your father used Excalibur to slay the headless horseman under your
                        bed. You’d come into the print shop night after night.” I smile at the memory, though one look
                        at Nathan’s startled face chases my smile away. “I’m sorry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Please don’t be. I guess I’m still getting used to the idea that you already
                        know me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Our feet dangle over the water, which breaks in a froth of bubbles around our
                        rock. Bear returns from where she had gone to quench her thirst and plants herself on Nathan’s
                        other side. Draping an arm around her, he watches the stream in the same steady way he regards
                        the world, absorbing much, giving away little.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He hooks his long fingers around the edge of our rock, stretching his back. The
                        stream whooshes and clucks. “Well, now that you know so many of my secrets, maybe you can tell
                        me some of yours.” His eyes widen a fraction.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My whole life is a secret.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“It doesn’t have to be.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-230" class="calibre21">The daylight draws him in sharp lines. For so many years,
                        his face was little more than a fuzzy image, despite him being as familiar as my own cloak. Is
                        it possible to have the kind of life his family offered me? Not just working with them, but
                        living among them, in the spaces that show? Interracial marriage is illegal, but no one can
                        legislate family, friendship, or love.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">When I don’t answer, he gives me half a smile. “I really just want to know,
                        since you are an experienced hatter, what do you think of my Homburg?” Removing the hat, he
                        flips it back and forth in front of him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You mean your humbug? It’s like a giant frown on the crown.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Then I shall continue wearing mine with pride.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“At least put a feather in it. Lizzie will appreciate that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He sets his hat back on his head, and the brim slumps into an extra-deep frown.
                        “I’m not interested in impressing Lizzie.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My suddenly fidgety hands pick up his book. Faded silver lettering on the
                        leather cover reads <i class="calibre7">Modern Horse Racing</i>. “Where did you get this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Used bookshop down the street.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Are you reading this for her?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Yes, I am reading this . . . for her. Not Lizzie.” The grumpy set of his jaw
                        has loosened, and his throat moves. “Jo, you’ve known me all your life. Do you think”&mdash;he
                        swallows&mdash;“do you think you could ever care for someone like me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My skin tingles, and my pulse clamors in my ears. As I watch his eyelashes bow,
                        the messy deck of my emotions squares itself and turns up a heart. I realize I am holding my
                        breath. “<i class="calibre7">Besotted</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Besotted?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“My favorite word. I lied, before.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The voice I have heard all my life whispers right by my ear. “Jo.” And I no
                        longer need to wonder how it would feel to kiss him.</p>

                    <h2>Forty-one</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">This time, when the portal to Billy’s cathouse heaves
                            open, Madam</span> Delilah lets me in without inquiry. Perhaps it is because I’m in the
                        company of Noemi, who, with her lightning-bolt scowl, looks in no mood to suffer fools. After a
                        perfunctory “Good evening, ma’am,” Noemi hooks her arm through mine and marches us past the
                        watchful square eyes of the Jesse James dice on the door. Madam Delilah’s shocked face seems to
                        droop under the weight of her cosmetic paste, like an old sock that is dangerously close to
                        slipping off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Does she know?” I whisper, hearing the woman’s boots scrabbling down the
                        hallway after us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She thinks the church sends me,” Noemi whispers in my ear. “Let me do the
                        talking.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My stomach clenches at the ripe scent of the overly perfumed hallways, and my
                        heartbeat picks up its feet. If the patrons here are curious about our arrival, I don’t notice,
                        as anger swells inside me. The only thing that stays me from storming the corridors is Noemi,
                        whose firm hand keeps me by her side.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In room 9, Billy Riggs sits at his desk, a cigar drooping from his mouth as he
                        writes in a ledger. His hat hangs on the wall, and his coppery hair is tied back by a black
                        ribbon. Sleeve garters keep his cuffs from smearing the ink. Four white men stand around the
                        table, their expressions caught between sheepish and surprised. Billy blinks at Noemi. “Is it
                        Sunday already?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi growls, but before she can speak, Billy closes his ledger. “If you’ll
                        excuse me for a moment, gentlemen, Madam Delilah will get you watered, on the house.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-231" class="calibre21">Casting us annoyed looks, the men file out and Madam
                        Delilah closes the door behind them. Billy rounds his desk and leans his backside against it.
                        “Let me guess, you’re not here to place illegal bets.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi lights in. “I never agreed with your depraved lifestyle. I did my honest
                        best to overlook the perversions in your soul, knowing judgment is not mine to pass. But when
                        you start taking swings at folks I know, <i class="calibre7">good</i> folks, you have gone too
                        far. Your creepy clothes-hanger almost done in Old Gin.” She pushes up the sleeves of her dress,
                        as if she is getting ready to take a swing herself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy puts up a hand, his open cuff blooming like a lily around his crooked
                        wrist. “What do you mean, ‘done in Old Gin’? I only told Knucks to scare him a bit. Then Knucks
                        comes back a bloody mess and bolts the door on his room. Thinks that old man put a curse on him.
                        I might have to hire someone new, and it’s not easy to find a good menace, you know?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I choke on my saliva. Old Gin bested Knucks?</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Serves both you creepy crawlers right,” Noemi snaps, clapping me on the back.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She’s the one who double-crossed <i class="calibre7">me</i>, giving me that
                        counterfeit elixir.” He picks up an already lit cigar from its ashtray. “I run a fair racket
                        here. You can’t expect a man to give away his assets for free.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Assets,” I say, seething, waving away the smoke. “If you weren’t blackmailing
                        Old Gin, I would never have debased myself by paying you a visit.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His coppery eyes cinch. “I was not blackmailing Old Gin. He came to me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nearly choke again. Old Gin would never have truck with a criminal like Billy
                        Riggs. “I don’t believe it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy takes a long draw of his tobacco, but Noemi plucks the stick from his
                        fingers. “Explain.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I never thought I’d see Noemi boss around the likes of Billy Riggs, but he is
                        surprisingly tolerant of her. “He wanted to buy back a family heirloom.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My eyes lock on to the empty space on the side table where the Buddha vase sat
                        before I threw it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy laughs at my horrified expression. “You flatter yourself. That was Ming
                        dynasty, worth six hundred dollars if you hadn’t broken it.” Moving toward his oddities shelf,
                        his twitchy fingers hover before his assortment of bottles. He selects the smallest&mdash;a jade
                        snuff bottle&mdash;and presents it to me with a mock bow. “Shang pawned it for twenty-five
                        dollars. Of course, over the years, it has accrued interest.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The bottle bears the shape of a peach, its roundness matching the impression in
                        the box I wanted for hair ribbons. Its color is the same green as the screw top with attached
                        spoon. It had belonged to Old Gin’s wife. My grandmother. The jade feels warm, like a polished
                        rock left in the sun.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre21">Old Gin’s story of the farmer’s son and the nymph creeps
                        into my mind. The son gave up the peach for the nymph, a peach meant to attract fortune. The
                        farmer, Old Gin, had taken steps to ensure our future by attempting to buy it back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi leans against the edge of his bathtub. “You thought an old groom could
                        pay that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Again, <i class="calibre7">he</i> came to <i class="calibre7">me</i>,” Billy
                        says through his teeth. “No one held a gun to his head.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi ties her arms into a knot. “Give her back that bottle. You know what I
                        have on you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy’s mouth purses into a petulant knot. “Even if I gave it back, she would
                        <i class="calibre7">still</i> owe me for my Ming vase. Besides, you wouldn’t rat me out. I just
                        gave an anonymous donation to that Bluebird society of yours.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Bluebells. Take it back. Your money comes with more strings than a harp.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">An argument starts up between them, with Billy protesting the banditry of his
                        favorite bauble, and Noemi making threats that she would likely never carry through. I pull at
                        my braid as my outrage loses its focus. It’s Billy’s own fault that Ming vase broke. As for the
                        snuff bottle, it is unfair to ask Noemi to spend more of her family currency persuading him to
                        return it when it was Shang’s decision to pawn the bottle away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I clear my throat and the arguing stops. “You are a man who values information,
                        secret information, am I right?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi’s chest expands, as if filling up to fuel all sorts of protests. I avoid
                        her eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Indeed.” Billy’s teeth seem to sharpen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I have some information about the race that I will trade in exchange for the
                        bottle.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He crosses to the open window and reposes upon the ledge. Dying sunlight
                        bronzes his pale skin. “I very much doubt you could tell me anything I don’t already know.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Life is full of risks,” I say, feeding his words back to him. “Keeps it
                        interesting.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy blows smoke in my face. “I’m afraid that’s not how it works. Tell me what
                        you know, and I will decide its worth. Otherwise, we are at an impasse.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My collar grows sticky, despite the breeze blowing in through the window. How
                        would Mrs. English close the deal? She would butter the biscuit so that it would be impossible
                        not to take a bite. “Unless you have received information in the last eight hours, let me assure
                        you, you do not know my secret, a secret that is sure to cause a stir when made public. Of
                        course, by then, you will have lost a very lucrative business opportunity.” The official betting
                        station may not offer odds on Sweet Potato, but an illegal gambling ring certainly can, and
                        Billy Riggs does not run the only racket in town.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-233" class="calibre21">Noemi suppresses a smile. She picks up a dried sea sponge
                        that resembles a brain and squeezes it. I can’t help thinking she is paying me a very peculiar
                        compliment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy’s hair rambles wildly around his head, somehow unshackled from its
                        ribbon. “Tell you what. I’ll buy your information with a hundred-dollar credit toward your
                        father’s bauble.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Not good enough. It would still take me a decade to save two hundred dollars.”
                        I toss out the words like dice. He could easily retract his offer, and then I would be out of
                        luck.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi’s grip on the sponge tightens even more, and this time, I do not think it
                        is a compliment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy’s leg begins to twitch just like that day in Buxbaum’s. “Once I am
                        satisfied with your information, I will make you another offer for how you may pay for the
                        remainder.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi gives me the barest nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Fine.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Now, what is this information?” He cuts an irritated glance at Noemi. “And it
                        better be good.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Oh, it’s good,” she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“As of this morning, I have been added to the roster.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You.” The news seems to suck Billy’s displeasure right out the window. “Well,
                        well. Ain’t you a thief’s bag, full of all sorts of goodies. But I hardly see how that
                        information helps me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“There will be no odds taken on my entry. <i class="calibre7">Official</i>
                        odds, that is.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A moth of a smile alights on his face. “You ever race before?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, but I know how to ride.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“And your horse. Is he seasoned?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“<i class="calibre7">She</i> has never raced either.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She.” He runs a pointy tongue over his lips, then chuckles. “Well, good.” He
                        shoots a few rounds from his finger guns. “People love a long shot. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I
                        have some odds in need of refinement.” He grabs his hat off the hook and wiggles it onto his
                        head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But what’s the offer for the rest?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy hardly seems to hear me, smoothing his eyebrows in a looking glass.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi’s reflection joins Billy’s in the mirror. Now that they are side by side,
                        I can see a family resemblance around the pointed cheekbones and square hairline. The eye sees
                        what it wants. “Make her an offer for the balance, you crook,” she says.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-234" class="calibre21">“Right.” Turning to me again, he straightens his vest so
                        that the pinstripes running down it are no longer lightning jags. His pupils slide to one corner
                        for a moment as he thinks, and then he scowls so hard, his forehead turns white. “A man I hate
                        has a pony in that race. I hate him for the simple fact that God handed him everything, while He
                        made me bow and scrape for every cent I own.” With quick tucks, he adjusts his sleeve garters.
                        “By all accounts, he operates on penny promises nowadays&mdash;there is some justice in the
                        world. Still, I would like nothing more than to see his horse and jockey bested by a pair of
                        females. In fact, his jockey was a patron here until I had to kick him out for being too rough
                        on the ladies.” He straightens his tie, oblivious to the irony in his statement. “You cross the
                        line before them, and you can have your bottle back.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My shoulders pull at my cloak. “I told you, I am a novice. If I make it around
                        the track, it will be a miracle.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He grins. “God and I may not see eye to eye”&mdash;in one smooth motion, he
                        slips into a rifle-brown frock coat&mdash;“but I do believe in miracles.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I release an effortless exhale. So, I must pull a chestnut from an open fire.
                        At least that horse is not Ameer. God may have handed Merritt everything, but the Payne heir is
                        as wealthy as sin itself. “Who is this horse?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“His name is Thief.”</p>

                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">The tincture has kept Old Gin in a foggy but hopefully
                            painless</span> state. But before the sun rises on Friday morning, Old Gin calls out, “Sao
                        Yue.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Grandfather?” I fly to his side from my makeshift bed. His eyes are unfocused
                        and wet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Sao Yue?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, it’s me, Jo.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His face falls, as if disappointed by the answer. I help him drink. “Who is Sao
                        Yue?” The words, meaning “graceful moon,” taste sweet on my tongue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Your grandmother. Sao Yue gave me a snuff bottle,” he gasps. “A wedding
                        present. Your father pawned it to the turtle egg, wanting to buy something to impress Mrs.
                        Payne, a hair comb, I think. He foolishly thought he had a chance with her. When I found out
                        what he had done, I”&mdash;his face crumples a little&mdash;“I raised my hand against him. I
                        told him he had shamed our family, and he must leave. I said I didn’t want to see him again.”
                        His chest collapses, as if the confession has broken something inside, and a thread-y cough
                        starts up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Shh, don’t talk.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He shakes his head. “I hoped, if I could get that peach back, the bats of good
                        fortune might return. Maybe bring my son back with them.” A tear rolls down his cheek, and he
                        turns his face away, as if to hide it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I pat his cheek with my flannel sleeve. “I will get Grandmother’s bottle back
                        for you.”</p>

                        of drilling at Six Paces, I return Sweet Potato to the Payne Estate, which is now fully
                        festooned for a party. The groundskeepers have cut topiaries in the shape of horses, and shaved
                        the lawn so close it looks like carpet. Balls made of flowers trim the gazebo. Hired domestics
                        are twisting wire around mason jars with candles, which will be hung in the trees. The post-race
                        party will be worthy of a visit from President Harrison himself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I am straightening Sweet Potato’s tack when I feel someone behind me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Caroline seems to have grown thinner since her episode with the face cream.
                        It’s as if the assault had siphoned off the baby fat and left wisdom in her cheeks. Her hair
                        falls in unkempt waves around her shoulders, and her gray dress with a lace bib makes her look
                        mature without being matronly. She carries a cardboard box with a handle, the kind given with
                        purchases at fancier shops.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You’re not with your father today?” I ask, when no words are forthcoming.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She shakes her head. “Mama wanted me to stay with her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I nod, not wanting an explanation. My heart tears a little, remembering all the
                        years we were at war without understanding why. The grievances I’d held against her have dropped
                        off like shriveled leaves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You look&mdash;” Her gaze spreads over my damp riding silks and to my
                        pebbled-goat-leather boots with my bulging toes. I brace myself for a jibe. But then she
                        finishes, “Like a winner.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I thought you were going to say train signal.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She smiles. “That, too.” An emotion flits over her face, hard to read in the
                        filtered light of the barn. She takes a measured breath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Is everything okay, my lady?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She winces and the box handle tightens in her grip. Another breath. Her
                        frost-blue eyes seem to melt, expanding in her face. “I am lost.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I’m surprised at the tears forming in my eyes. “Then you should look up. The
                        sky reminds us that troubles are not permanent. Of course, right now, there’s just cobwebs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She attempts a smile, but a tear splashes out. She whisks it away with the back
                        of her hand. “This is for you.” She holds up her box. “My riding boots. You will need them for
                        tomorrow.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Your violin boots? I&mdash;I can’t.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“They are just boots.” She sets them down by my feet. “And besides, I want you
                        to braid my hair.” She pulls a comb and pins from her pocket. “If you don’t mind.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Tomorrow is the start of the debutante season, and Caroline will be the belle
                        of the ball. I square a stool into the ground. “Your chair, my lady.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre21">I begin to braid, and the soothing scents of hay and
                        leather mingle with wonderment over what could’ve been. A strange and meditative peace settles
                        over us. We don’t speak until I’ve pinned the last pin and adjusted the curls around her face.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I’ve been thinking,” says Caroline. “I might buy one of those safeties for
                        myself.” A dozen emotions paddle across her face. None find mooring. “Do you think Noemi would
                        show me how to ride?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Probably not,” I say, though we both know, if Caroline demanded it, Noemi
                        would have to give in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A flush builds on her cheeks, and she shakes air into her skirts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I sigh. I may never be friends with Caroline Payne. But maybe the freedom
                        machine will move us all a step forward. “Let’s go ask her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>

                        damp shoulders. I step into Old Gin’s room, scarlet silk skimming my figure, my hair braided
                        into two tight buns on my head. Old Gin refused the tincture last night, preferring pain to
                        feeling groggy. His face is a sunset of blue, red, purple, and gray, with more bruises blooming
                        each day. Deeper injuries take longer to surface.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I shake the tincture. “How about half a dose? I’m worried about infection.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He shakes his head. “If I don’t feel the hurt, I wonder if I’m alive.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Then you must feel very alive.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">His forehead crimps. “In life, there will be many races. Not all must be run.
                        Sweet Potato will not be disappointed if she misses this one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Short of using the Paynes’ family telephone, I can’t imagine how our mare
                        managed to convey that. “As it turns out, Billy has agreed to return the bottle if Sweet Potato
                        can cross the line before Thief.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He makes a noise that’s halfway between a grumble and a sigh. To my surprise,
                        he doesn’t press me for details. “Thief has good legs.” He licks his dry lips. “But it takes a
                        good heart to win a race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Like his. I give him a wide smile. “So, you really thought Sweet Potato could
                        beat Ameer?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Maybe, maybe not. But she told me she had to try.” His good eye winks and I
                        resist the urge to hug him. His face goes serious again. “The Bells are good people. But staying
                        will change the direction of the wind here. Winds can be . . . scandalous.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Are you worried about the <i class="calibre7">Focus</i>? I would continue
                        using a pseudonym. No one need know.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Wasn’t talking about pseudonym.” His eyes drift toward the door, where the
                        sound of Nathan’s casual whistling drifts in.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-237" class="calibre21">I sip from his water, suddenly parched myself. He’s
                        right. Even if Nathan and I managed to carve a spot for ourselves in Atlanta, it would be a
                        secret isle like Avalon, and if anyone ever found out, the publisher could be ruined.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin studies the double tents formed by his feet and then shrugs. “The river
                        travels fastest around the stones. But sometimes, the stones must be faced head-on. Who knows?
                        With enough momentum, a path may clear, hm?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Do you think we should accept the Bells’ offer?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I think you are good at making your own rules.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>

                        reception area, where Bear, his mother, and I stand, his <i class="calibre7">Modern Horse
                            Racing</i> book open before him. “I would say good luck, but according to the book, jockeys
                        are particular about those things. I could give you a lucky penny or a rock from my collection.
                        Scratch that, I don’t have a collection&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I know about the collection.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He gives me a sheepish grin. Dressed in a linen jacket, whipcord trousers, and
                        wingtips, he could easily be one of the young men girding themselves for the battle for the
                        debutantes. Only his insouciant Homburg hat marks him as an outlier. The daisies he wrapped with
                        lace for Lizzie are still sprightly despite the humidity. I feel myself grimacing and force my
                        thoughts to other avenues.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My gaze drifts toward Old Gin’s room, where he is dozing. His skin felt too
                        warm when I left, and his eye had begun to bleed again. What if he takes a turn for the worse
                        while I am away? I could never forgive myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Bell hands me Old Gin’s cap, which she washed and brushed clean. “Don’t
                        worry. Your grandfather will be in good hands.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you, ma’am.” I square Old Gin’s cap on my head and nod to Nathan. “See
                        you at the race.” Then I slip out. Another battle requires my attention.</p>
                    <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre19">&mdash;</span></p>
                    <p class="calibre1">T<span class="calibre9">HE VIOLIN BOOTS </span>put an unfamiliar elegance in my
                        step as I lead Sweet Potato into Piedmont Park. Thanks to Caroline’s habit of wearing her shoes
                        hard, the boots are comfortably broken in, and I may never take them off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">It is hard not to stare at all the finely dressed couples in their open-air
                        carriages and pleasure wagons. The hats alone are dizzying. Tall satins with crushed-velvet
                        bows, cake hats with their layers of ribbons, and of course, Miss Sweetie hats in fresh colors
                        like strawberry and lemon. Mrs. English must be pouring herself a tall coca cordial right about
                        now.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre21">There are also a number of black faces in the crowd. The
                        Paynes, not the Gentlemen’s Driving Club, make the rules today, and as long as the colored can
                        pay the fee, Mrs. Payne will not turn away donations to her charity.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">People line up at an awning painted with the word <i
                            class="calibre7">B</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">ETS</i></span>, parasols
                        open. Nearby, a contingent of women with marigold sashes has drawn the attention of a crowd.
                        “Votes! For! Women!” Mrs. Bullis pumps her fist with each word, shaking her half of the banner.
                        I can’t help noticing that the horse’s backside looks more professionally stitched than the
                        front half.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“That’s our cheering gallery,” I tell Sweet Potato, who is nibbling the cap off
                        my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The crowd parts, and the sight of another marching group pulls the stuffing
                        right out of me. These marchers wear sashes of violet blue and are singing. A woman on a bicycle
                        leads the charge: Noemi. Behind her, Rose and Mary carry a white banner stitched with the words
                        <i class="calibre7">A</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">TLANTA </i></span><i
                            class="calibre7">B</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">LUEBELLS:</i></span> <i
                            class="calibre7">V</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">OTES FOR </i></span><i
                            class="calibre7">A</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">LL </i></span><i
                            class="calibre7">W</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">OMEN</i></span>.
                        Embroidered around the banner are all manner of colorful flowers, not just bluebells.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The Atlanta Suffragists’ chant falls off, and Mrs. Bullis’s teapot face looks
                        like it’s gathering steam.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi pedals up to me and then stands, with August wedged under her. A new
                        basket is strapped to the handlebars, lined with a picnic blanket. On her straw hat, her Farney
                        the Falcon knot pins down a sprig of bluebells.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">She grins. “You got a plan for getting around the track?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After finishing his book on horse racing, Nathan discussed strategy with me,
                        but none of it stuck. “Once the bell rings, go as fast as I can go.” I just have to beat one
                        horse today. Perhaps I can keep my seat simply by focusing on Thief. I’ve never seen the piebald
                        run at full steam, though I imagine he can burn up a track, with every line of his sleek and
                        tapered body suggesting motion.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi laughs, and her eyes drift beyond my shoulder. “Mr. Buxbaum said Robby
                        could stay on as clerk.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I let out a squeal, wondering if “The Custom-ary” had anything to do with his
                        decision. “Give him my congratulations.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Give them yourself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby strides up, dapper in his Sunday suit of brushed cotton. “Hello, Jo!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Hello yourself. I hear I owe you some teeth rinse.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“How about we toast with it after you cross the line? We’re real proud of you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi nods. “Just moving down that road is a victory.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Robby leans in, his laughing eyes glinty. “But bring home the big fish, okay?”
                        He waves a ticket at me. “I got a bet on Sunday Surprise. But I also got one on you.” He winks.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-239" class="calibre21">The Atlanta Suffragists have again started up their
                        battle cry, drowning out the Bluebells’ singing. Mrs. Bullis is frowning at us, and I give her a
                        little wave that she does not return. She hands her part of the banner to another woman and
                        stalks over. “You.” She crooks her pinky at Noemi. “Your group is making us into a spectacle.
                        And you.” The pinky switches to me. “You arranged this to spite me.” She grimaces at the sight
                        of Sweet Potato, drooling on my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I wish I had that much influence, ma’am.” I drape my arm around Sweet Potato’s
                        neck. “Rest assured, my mare and I will do our best.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Mare?” Her gaze slides under Sweet Potato. “Oh, good gullywash. We will be
                        laughingstocks!” Her face crumples, and I feel myself softening, curse my wax heart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“If you believe that females are equal to males, then have faith, ma’am.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Her face unwrinkles, and she gusts out an indignant “Well!” Then she storms
                        back to her suffragists, hissing to the Bluebells as she passes, “Will you please hush?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The Bluebells break off their song. Noemi sighs. “I better move the troops,
                        before they show us the boot. But first, I made you something to help you get past Thief.” From
                        her pocket, she pulls something wrapped in wax paper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“A cookie?” I reach for it, but she pulls it away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Not you.” She holds it to Sweet Potato, who snatches it right up, wax paper
                        and all. “It’s got my secret ingredient. Never hurts to try.” She grins and all the bluebells on
                        her hat grin along.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Do you have an extra sash?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, but you can have mine.” She whips it off, then watches as I tie it around
                        my waist. Something airy and hopeful wings around her face. “Good luck, sister.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sprinting races have already begun to warm up the crowd for the main event. A
                        sign with the word <i class="calibre7">C</i><span class="calibre9"><i
                                class="calibre7">ONTESTANTS</i></span> points toward the stables at the far end of the
                        grandstand. The word chases a chill up and down my spine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I ignore the stares, as I have done all my life. The noise of the attendees
                        collects in my ears, making my heart pound like Etta Rae is whacking it with her rug-beater
                        hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A gray horse barrels past me, tossing its anvil of a head and snapping its
                        jaws. A purple saddle pad emblazoned with the number 4 wraps the horse’s middle. Where do I get
                        one of those numbers? Perhaps this is where having a team helps.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The grandstand is beginning to fill. There must be at least five hundred people
                        there already, watching the sprint races, with room for five hundred more. Next to the
                        grandstand, more people amass under a magnolia tree, on which is nailed a sign, <i
                            class="calibre7">C</i><span class="calibre9"><i class="calibre7">OLORED</i></span>. There
                        are no chairs, but some folks have brought picnic blankets to set on the ground. I picture Old
                        Gin standing under that tree, not weak and battered, but as he used to look, balanced and whole.
                        His shabby clothes still hang neatly, and he faces the world with serenity, as if he had landed
                        right on the spot he was supposed to land. He waves his flag at me, onward.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-240" class="calibre21">Behind a line of trees, a double strip of stables is
                        populated by a grunting, noisy mass of men clustered around horses. The gray anvil that passed
                        us earlier rears up on its hindquarters, and its jockey, a man with a weathered face, yells
                        curses. Old Gin never cursed at a horse. Horses only give, never take, and should be treated
                        with respect. Another horse screams, and I recognize it as the voice of a certain Arabian,
                        Ameer. Johnny Fortune rides him into the arena, looking splendid in gold silks, a riding crop
                        under his arm. I do not see Thief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato and I stride up to an official-looking man with a red bowler to
                        match his bright bulb of a nose. “Good morning, sir. I am Jo Kuan, and this is Sweet Potato. We
                        are here to check in for the race.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You? There are only twelve animals in this race, and certainly no females.” He
                        spits out that last word as if it were a seed that had gotten stuck in his teeth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But&mdash;could you please check again?” I eye the ledger he clasps to his
                        velvet cutaway. “Mrs. Payne added us to the roster herself.” At least, she said she did. <i
                            class="calibre7">Don’t let me down again. Not today.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I have the roster memorized. Twelve horses, all checked in already. Now, move
                        along, or I shall call security.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But I&mdash;but we&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A tailored morning suit struts up on shiny sable boots. “There you are, Miss
                        Kuan. We’ve been waiting for you. Have you been giving our last jock a hard time, Mr. Thorne?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Merritt Payne twists one handle of his three-forty-five mustache and looks down
                        his aristocratic nose at the official.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mr. Thorne flips through the pages of his ledger, nearly dropping it in his
                        agitation. “Er, sorry, Mr. Payne. I was sure I knew all of the contestants. Twelve, I thought it
                        was&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Please.” Merritt wiggles his fingers. “Now you are wasting our time. Come,
                        Miss Kuan, Sweet Potato. Your stable boy is waiting, and they will be calling for line shortly.”

                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">Merritt leads us through the noisy morass of man, beast,
                            sweat,</span> and fear. And the race hasn’t even begun. “Thorne is an ass.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Thank you. I’m not sure what I would’ve done.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He gives me a tight-lipped smile. “Carried on, as you always do, Jo.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I try to read his face for signs that he knows about our true relationship, but
                        there is only the sunset of his smile, a glassy look to the blue-gray eyes inherited from his
                        mother, and a slight pull to his brow, as if snagged by too many thoughts. I mourn the brother
                        that could’ve been, somehow feeling a loss that never happened.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-241" class="calibre21">I’m surprised to find little Joseph Porter standing in
                        his military stance when Merritt and I walk up, his flat cap extra sharp.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Joseph will lead your horse to the line when it’s time. Good luck, Jo. If
                        races were won on gumption and not speed, you would have my wager.” He bows, and Merritt Payne
                        carries himself away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Good morning, Joseph. At ease. I didn’t expect to see you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“You neither. Old Gin gave me ten cents to attend him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“He isn’t feeling well. I’m subbing in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Moving briskly, Joseph leads Sweet Potato to a watering trough. As she slakes
                        her thirst, he unfastens her saddle. He shakes out a satin horse pad, which matches exactly the
                        Suffragists’ marigold banner, stitched with the number 13. “Sorry about the number, but if it
                        helps, Mama says thirteen isn’t unlucky if you spit on it, and I done that for you.” He shows me
                        the wet spot right between the 1 and 3.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Why, thank you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“But don’t hold your breath, because you’ll still have the most distance to
                        cover on the outside lane.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The odds rocket away, and my spine contracts like a squeezed concertina. I only
                        hope that Thief is number 12. “Anything else I should know?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Stay away from Four and Six. Their riders don’t have a good look on them. They
                        got hayseed eyes, like they’re common and ain’t above taking what’s not theirs.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Number 4’s the anvil horse. Joseph jerks his head toward 6, a chestnut whose
                        checker-sleeved jockey stands with his back partly turned toward me, staring up at a tree. Water
                        begins trickling down the trunk, and I quickly avert my eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I certainly hope he remembers to thank the tree when he’s done. Threading
                        through the mass, I size up the competition, though I’m really just looking for the piebald with
                        its distinctive white hull and black fringe and rudder. Men scowl when they see me, or laugh
                        outright, and I’m not sure which is worse. One just turns up his nose, staring right through me.
                        Clearly, I am no threat to them, but perhaps that is an advantage. The biggest threats are the
                        ones we fail to acknowledge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A familiar chiseled profile in a swashbuckler hat and charcoal cutaway emerges
                        from a stable. I should be focusing on the horse he leads, but Mr. Q commands attention in a way
                        Billy Riggs could never hope to replicate, not even with his showy wardrobe or manners. Mr. Q
                        walks with a handsome gait that seems practiced, shoulders rolled back, head held high for
                        viewing. His olive complexion seems carved from soap, with sideburns that must have been shaped
                        with a ruler. The only flaw is a twist to his pillowy lips that, like a scratch in the mirror,
                        isn’t visible from all angles. But once you know it’s there, it is hard to forget.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-242" class="calibre21">Something sour coats my tongue. We both got here through
                        a personal connection, but mine didn’t cost a human heart&mdash;specifically, Caroline’s. He was
                        just using her to get his horse in the race.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The number 9 is stitched to Thief’s saddle blanket. He is not number 12 as I’d
                        hoped, but at least he is not number 1. Any relief I feel evaporates when a runt of a man in
                        green silks takes the horse by the bridle. It’s the leprechaun who leered at me from the porch
                        of Billy Riggs’s cathouse. His brazen gaze gropes mine, recognizing me, too. So, this is the man
                        Billy ejected for being too rough on women. Mean comes in all sizes, and getting up on a horse
                        doesn’t change that one bit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I hurry back to Joseph and Sweet Potato, my collar feeling sticky. Any
                        confidence I felt when I left Old Gin drains from my violin boots into the dry earth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Someone calls, “Line!” and the chaos of beast and man begins to slowly
                        organize. Jockeys mount up, and grooms take positions at the bridle. Companion ponies calm
                        nerves on the way to the track. I step up on Sweet Potato, and her solid warmth calms my own
                        bucking heart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A colored jockey with an easy smile brings his muscular roan up to us. “Ben
                        Abner, and this is Sunday Surprise.” He speaks like he has a train to catch. “Mr. Buxbaum told
                        me to say hello. It’s a fast track today, but there are a couple sticky parts. Keep those
                        horseshoes on, and don’t let them box you in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Pleased to meet you, Mr. Abner, and thank you, I will,” I respond as if I have
                        any idea what he’s talking about.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He tugs the brim of his cap and clicks his tongue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Joseph watches the pair trot off, his mouth ajar. “Sunday’s the one I’d bet on.
                        He’s number two, a good spot. The number-two lane wins most often.” Sweet Potato tries to knock
                        off Joseph’s cap, but he ducks. “No offense, girl.” Taking her by the halter, he leads us to the
                        back of the line. The foul leprechaun swivels on Thief’s saddle and shows me an overbite so
                        severe, he could probably slide pecans into his mouth without opening it. I pretend to ignore
                        him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A big horse like Thief will roll like a boulder off a slope. Once he gets
                        going, there will be no stopping his momentum. We will need to break from the start as fast as
                        possible. Of course, that’s easier said than done, especially with no time to train Sweet
                        Potato. Then again, Old Gin has been training her. Perhaps she already knows how to blow from
                        the line.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We emerge from the trees, a parade of bright silks and clinking harnesses. The
                        grandstand seems to vibrate with all the people cheering, waving their flags and hats, despite
                        the oppressive humidity. I shield my eyes against the glare. A clot of clouds traps the sun, and
                        more seem to be rolling in from all sides.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-243" class="calibre21">From the colored section, a cheer goes up when Ben Abner
                        passes by, his tightly muscled back flexing with each of his horse’s hoofbeats.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Someone yells, “Jo!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Noemi waves at me, Robby next to her. Life is a chessboard, and if you’ve
                        played it right, your best pieces will be standing in the right squares when you need them most.
                        On the other side of Noemi, Rose waves, too, almost hitting the man next to her. He opens his
                        hands, and she jabs a finger in my direction, as if that should explain it all.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato walks tall and there is a swing of joy to her hoofbeats. <i
                            class="calibre7">To understand your horse is to understand yourself.</i> I remind myself it
                        is a small miracle that I am here at the biggest race of the year with arguably the best view in
                        the house. Whether I win back that bottle or not, something has cleared my view. Millinery gave
                        me a way to be seen; Miss Sweetie gave me a voice to be heard. But maybe what I needed most of
                        all was simply the freedom to walk out from the shadows of my hat. Somehow, Old Gin and I have
                        managed to fit ourselves into a society that, like a newspaper, rarely comes in colors other
                        than black and white. There will always be those who keep their distance. But there will also be
                        those who don’t mind riding their safeties in my lane. I spent my whole life worried that the
                        sound of my own voice might give me away, but I was wrong about that. If I hadn’t used my voice,
                        I wouldn’t be here today.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In a special box several rows up, the Paynes watch the procession with other
                        members of Atlanta’s elite. Mr. Payne leans forward against a rail, like the masthead of a ship,
                        his opera glasses fixed to his eyes. He has always been more focused on the future than the
                        present. Next to him stands Merritt, who, for all his invitations, seems not to have accepted a
                        single one of them. His eyes drift from Ameer to me, and he gives me a two-fingered salute.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne fans herself, her pleasant demeanor on display. She doesn’t
                        acknowledge me. But when I pass, her smile wavers like a candle that feels a breath. Next to
                        her, Caroline watches me with a hawk-eyed diligence. The dancing-lion braid I wove into her hair
                        is still lively under a cream saucer hat. Despite falling off Noemi’s safety half a dozen
                        times&mdash;a fact that has seemed to put a spring in Noemi’s step&mdash;Caroline declared she
                        hasn’t been bested yet. Though it wasn’t clear if she was talking about the bicycle or Noemi,
                        the winds have shifted for my former mistress. May she feel the stretch of a new wing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Welcome to the Race of the Year, eight furlongs of thunderous action!” calls
                        an announcer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Members of the press have positioned themselves along the gate that separates
                        the track from the spectators, notebooks out and scribbling furiously. Signs on posts list all
                        the sponsors and their horse numbers and colors. I scan the crowd for Nathan, wishing to see
                        him, but dreading the sight of Lizzie on his arm.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-244" class="calibre21">A figure steps onto a box and tips up his Homburg. I sit
                        a little taller, hoping I look like an elegant lady floating along on an ebony swan. Nathan
                        waves his hat. He doesn’t have Mr. Q’s dreamy looks or Merritt Payne’s statuesque physique, but
                        he has the noble bearing of a compass that always points north.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A pair of pink arms asks for a lift, and soon, Lizzie is standing beside him.
                        They are a handsome pair. Nathan would have an easier life with someone like her, someone with
                        whom the law against miscegenation has no bearing. Her Miss Sweetie hat swivels between Nathan
                        and me. Maybe she is thinking the same thing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Joseph leads us to a chalked line on the outermost position on the track. I
                        shake off the stiffness in my limbs caused by an anxious mind and draw an effortless breath.
                        “Thank you, Joseph.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He hits a brace. Then he follows the grooms to the sidelines.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Twelve beasts grunt and paw at the ground to the left of us, springs loaded and
                        ready to fire. The track strikes me as narrow and flimsy as cardboard. One wrong move, and I
                        could be smashed into a papery pulp, a bit of bark caught under forty-eight pounding pistons.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">A few horses down, Thief undulates as if he were made of liquid, with the
                        leprechaun clinging, amphibian-like, on his back. The man is no longer looking at me but
                        muttering at the clouds. Perhaps he is praying. It seems like a good time to get religion.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Scanning the stadium, I finally spot Billy Riggs near the center, blocking the
                        view behind him with a garish plum-colored top hat to match his suit. Our gazes connect, and he
                        stands, sweeps off the top hat, and gives me one of his mocking bows. It occurs to me that just
                        as Old Gin and I have done our best to blend in, Billy makes his way by not blending in. Perhaps
                        his brazen style is meant to draw attention away from his crimes, not the least of which is the
                        crime of having a great-grandparent who was colored. Around Billy, folks chatter, their faces
                        animated, and I wonder what secrets lie in the basement for them. For all of us. My eyes find
                        Mrs. Payne again, holding out a gloved hand for a guest to kiss. Her hands may be clean, but
                        she’s as slippery as a hundred bathing Billys.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Before the field begins to lose the line, the man with the red bowler raises a
                        gun. “Ready?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I grip the stirrups and lean forward.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Set?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I imagine myself as the wind, light and strong, and not invisible.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Forty-four</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">I kick my heels hard, screaming, “Giddap!” as loud as I
                            can. Sweet</span> Potato charges!</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">In the span of two seconds, several things happen. Something spooks horse
                        number 1, and he sets off in the wrong direction. Jockeys 4 and 6 with their hayseed eyes jerk
                        their horses sideways, knocking off 3 and 5, whose horses almost go to their knees.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Just as Joseph suspected, 4 and 6 are up to no good, and it is hard to predict
                        what they plan next.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">We pass Noemi and the Bluebells, who are shrieking wildly and jumping up and
                        down. In the stands, the Suffragists are all up on their feet, yelling just as loud, and it
                        strikes me that the collective roar is louder than the sum of its parts. Mrs. Bullis clutches
                        her face, eyes levered as far as they can go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Coming up on the first curve, Sweet Potato and I are far from the lead, but at
                        least Thief is behind us. Ameer and 11 lead the pack, tailed by 4 at the rail, and Sunday
                        Surprise behind him. I move Sweet Potato into position behind Sunday Surprise, hoping Buxbaum’s
                        champ will clear the road ahead, clinching our tenuous lead over Thief. Number 4 drifts right,
                        leaving an opening that Sunday surges to thread. But then 4 veers back to the rail, forcing
                        Sunday to dodge right. Number 6 closes in, boxing in Sunday, and we all bunch up behind them. So
                        that’s what Ben Abner was talking about!</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">From my spot behind Sunday, it’s clear that 4 and 6 are working together, but
                        to whose benefit? There can be only one winner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Out of the corner of my eye, a flash of green circles wide around the curve,
                        avoiding the traffic, and then dashes ahead. It’s the leprechaun on Thief! Somehow, Mr. Q has
                        rigged Thief up for the win. But how was he able to buy off not just one, but two contestants?
                        Surely, credit only goes so far.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-245" class="calibre21">I think back to that day at Buxbaum’s. Robby said Billy
                        had offered to “influence” the race in favor of Mr. Buxbaum’s horse, Sunday Surprise. Billy has
                        enough money to influence the race. He wasn’t successful with Mr. Buxbaum, but for every road
                        that runs straight, a dozen go crooked, especially a road who would name his fine horse for a
                        petty criminal. It occurs to me that Thief’s number 9 is the sum total of Billy’s lucky dice, 4
                        and 5, same as the number on his “office” door. I have been outfoxed. Billy would never have let
                        his favorite bauble go so easily.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Predictably, jockeys 4 and 6 have expended their horses’ energies and begin to
                        fall behind. But the damage is done, and though Sunday is doing his best to keep up, all the
                        dodging about has cost him his legs, too. Ahead, 11 stalls on a sticky spot, long enough for
                        Thief to shorten the gap between them, with the bulk of the contestants two lengths behind him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Lightning puts cracks in the sky, and moments later, thunder shatters the
                        clouds. A buckskin gelding in the front rears up at the noise, then takes off in the wrong
                        direction. Rain pours down in sheets, drenching us in seconds. More horses fumble, but not Sweet
                        Potato, bless her steady legs, legs that Old Gin kneaded and trained with his own hands. He
                        didn’t give up on her, and I bet she will not so easily give up on me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I claw at the rain blinding me, my heart lurching as I slip around in the
                        saddle. Mud flies all around. The ground looms dangerously close, becoming slicker and stickier
                        with every passing moment. Beside us, a horse stumbles, causing the one behind it to careen into
                        the rail in a blur of hair and muscle. Sweet Potato jerks right, throwing me off balance again.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Somehow, I manage to keep my seat. It strikes me that the cloudbuster that just
                        knocked out several of my opponents could spell the end of me, too. Thief has managed to stay
                        ahead of our stampede, with Ameer and number 11 still going strong beyond him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Taking advantage of the straightaway, I stick out my tailbone, leaning as much
                        as I can into Sweet Potato’s neck to help power her forward. Every hit of her legs rattles into
                        my bones, but I hang on, feeling more like a saddlebag than a passenger. Ameer clears the next
                        turn just ahead with the drenched Johnny Fortune still easy as a blink upon him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Somehow, Sweet Potato closes the distance behind Thief to one length. His tail
                        whips about like a pirate’s flag as we come upon the turn, and now it’s a two-horse battle for
                        the rail. Here’s our chance to get ahead! The leprechaun clinches Thief to the inside path, with
                        the wooden rail only four feet to his left. Four feet is the width of a stall&mdash;wide enough
                        for a horse with nerve to pass, though at a gallop, few will dare. But my horse is smaller, and
                        she will dare.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-246" class="calibre21">“Ready, girl? Giddap!” I tap Sweet Potato with my heels,
                        and she surges ahead, slipping through the space between Thief and the rail as satiny smooth as
                        a black ribbon around the neck. We come up alongside Thief, and the sour smell of the horse
                        clears my nostrils.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Whore!” spits the leprechaun as we pass him. He raises his arm and then brings
                        down his crop against my leg, so sharply I think he’s sliced it right off. I would scream, but
                        my lungs are empty of air and all that emerges is a wheezy cry. The pain is like no other I have
                        felt and makes me bite down so hard, I swear I must break teeth. My posture crumples away,
                        undoing all the advantage we have just gained.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato shudders, and I think it is over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">But as we come out of the turn, she shrieks out all the rage I feel inside.
                        When the leprechaun draws up beside us, my big-hearted mare snaps her teeth, trying to take a
                        bite of him, her brown eyes rolling and the froth off her mouth slinging like venom. It’s not
                        his hat she wants to taste, but blood.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The leprechaun dodges her blow with a yell, and Thief stumbles, his eyes glassy
                        with panic. I clamber back over Sweet Potato’s neck. As we correct our course, I do not look
                        back. <i class="calibre7">Attagirl!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">At the head of the stretch, number 11 has fallen back, tripped by the mud, and
                        within moments, we pass him. Ameer, four lengths ahead, slows as he always does when he no
                        longer feels chased. “Lazy in the lead,” Johnny Fortune had called it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Just cross the line, girl, and we will win back Old Gin’s
                            bottle.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Or perhaps we can do more.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bright blood soaks the scarlet of my pants, and my front is caked with mud.
                        There is only one <i class="calibre7">G</i>-word left to speak, one that left me shaken at
                        thirteen but now directs my path.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21"><i class="calibre7">Go.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The grandstand appears in view again, but the cries of the frenzied crowd dull
                        in my ears. In the final stretch, it’s not the crowd I see, but the family who raised me, waving
                        their flags. I raise a glass of appreciation to each.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">To Noemi and Robby, for friendship.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">To the Bells, for words.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">To Lucky Yip, for skill.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">To Hammer Foot, for protection.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">And most of all to you, Old Gin, for hearing the faint cries of someone who
                        needed you and not turning away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Mrs. Payne lifts her teary eyes to me, and the splinter of her betrayal works
                        itself free of my heart. A Chinese baby, out of wedlock, no less, there was no easy answer for
                        her. But unlike my mother, I do not live in a gilded cage, and like Sweet Potato, whose mother
                        also rejected her, somehow I will find a way to thrive.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-247" class="calibre21">We hang back as we did at Six Paces, waiting for Ameer to
                        loosen his pace even more. And when he does, we charge up the straightaway, powered by love and
                        maybe a pinch of pepper, the secret ingredient. His jaunty tail teases us. Three lengths become
                        two, and then one, and then a streak of white sand barely visible in the mud.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Sweet Potato throws her heart to the sky. With a sob, we sail past Ameer across
                        the line.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Forty-five</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">“Tie!” announces the man in the red bowler hat.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The cloudbuster shuts off as fast as it let down, and the ground steams at its
                        departure. Ameer trots beside us, panting and, for the first time, looking chastened. Johnny
                        Fortune grinds his black eyes into mine and spits. He knows he was bested. Still, he holds up
                        his fists in victory, and cheers explode all around us. The eye sees what it wants, and they
                        would never have let us win, anyway.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Billy Riggs also knows he was bested. His wet clothes have darkened to a shade
                        that must match his mood, and he sits with his palm smashed up against his cheek. The sight of
                        his misery lessens the throbbing cut in my thigh, and a horseshoe of a grin edges up on my face.
                        <i class="calibre7">We are even now, you scoundrel.</i> Noticing me floating in my saddle, he
                        uncrumples himself and rises. I expect one of his mocking bows. But instead, a grudging smile
                        unfurls on his face and he begins to clap. I know the next time I pass through the doors with
                        the Jesse James dice, I will not leave empty-handed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The fanfare passes in a blur, the victory lap around the track with Johnny
                        Fortune and Ameer, the handshaking and occasional claps on the back, the tearful hugs from Mrs.
                        Bullis, and the photograph of me, the Atlanta Suffragists, and the Bluebells&mdash;well, at
                        least Noemi&mdash;taken by a man with an accordion-style camera. While Sweet Potato tries to eat
                        her wreath of carnations, Nathan embraces me longer than he should. “Where is Lizzie?” I ask.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“She said it wouldn’t work out for us and took a coach home.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I’d like to think Lizzie did not know about her mother’s attempt to unmask me.
                        She was never the bad sort. I expect this will be the last I see of her, though a part of me
                        wishes things could’ve been different between us.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-248" class="calibre21">As soon as I can escape, I steer Sweet Potato back to the
                        print shop. There is only one face I wish to see.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">My feet go cold when I spot Dr. Swift’s wagon parked next to the Bells’ house.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Without even tying up Sweet Potato, I rush into the house, past Mr. and Mrs.
                        Bell’s surprised faces, and into Old Gin’s room. <i class="calibre7">Please no, don’t take Old
                            Gin.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear greets me with a <i class="calibre7">woof!</i> To my surprise, Dr. Swift
                        has pulled a chair up beside Old Gin, and between them is a Western chessboard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Grandfather,” I cry, knees wobbling under me. “I thought&mdash;I thought . .
                        .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Dr. Swift’s eyes glint with amusement under his thick brows. “You thought I
                        might’ve beaten your grandfather in chess? Don’t worry, he’s checked me three times already, and
                        I only arrived ten minutes ago.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Old Gin lifts his face to me. With his new orange striped cap, his eye bandage,
                        and a beard beginning to icicle down his chin, he looks like a stringy old pirate who, despite a
                        few rocky seas, still has a few more voyages left in him. “You had a nice ride, hm?” His dry
                        words float out, understated as always.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I let out a half sob, half laugh. “The bats of good fortune have returned. We
                        won.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">He works his jaw, but nothing comes out. Tears troop down my face, but he stops
                        them with his bandaged hand. “I think the bats have been here with us this whole time.” His
                        broken face smiles, and I’m reminded of a gentle boost onto my first horse in a meadow full of
                        light.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
                    <p id="calibre_link-249" class="calibre1">Three months later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre20">The curtain with the horses now decorates the basement
                            wall,</span> opening up our former kitchen. An old desk has replaced my bed in the corner,
                        and one of Mrs. Bell’s whimsical rugs softens the back half of the room, more luxurious than the
                        old speckled rug under my toes. At the spool table, my fingers work a silk cord into a horse
                        knot. Mr. Buxbaum says he can’t keep them on the shelf. Anything with horses has been a hot
                        seller since the race.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">The sight of Old Gin’s milking stool warms my heart. He’s out with Sweet
                        Potato. Daily rides have done much for his health.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Graceful Moon’s snuff bottle occupies a prime spot atop our new wall shelf,
                        next to my winner’s medal, a twin to Johnny Fortune’s. With half the winnings from the race, we
                        can afford to house Sweet Potato at the livery down the street, plus save for the future,
                        whenever that decides to get here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I wind the cord three times around my finger and weave the end through the
                        loops. Silk cord innately has value, but it takes a patient hand to shape it into something
                        better. What is the job of a parent but to teach a child that she has worth so that one day she
                        can transform herself into whatever she wants. Old Gin was that parent to me, mother and father,
                        teacher and friend. One day &mdash;hopefully far into the future&mdash;he and Graceful Moon will
                        ride the heavens together, faces no longer turned up to the sky, but part of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">As for Shang, I hope he found what he was looking for, whether that be silver
                        or self-worth. Wherever his journey takes him, as long as the earth is round, may his path lead
                        home one day.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Ahoy there.” Nathan’s voice tumbles down the listening tube, which is now also
                        a speaking tube.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">Bear woofs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I cross to the desk. “Ahoy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Would you like some tea or a chocolate? Bear is also offering her bone.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No, thank you. I am leaving for Buxbaum’s shortly. May I get you anything from
                        there? Quills? Candles? Giddy goobers?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I like my goobers relaxed. Makes them go down easier. Are you sure you don’t
                        want company?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I shall be fine. Please tell your mother I shall be back in an hour to help
                        her roast the chicken.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“I look forward to that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“Roast chicken?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">“No. You being back.”</p>

            <section id="author-note" class="chapter hidden">
                <article>
                    <h2>Author's Note</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre9">WERE YOU SURPRISED </span>to learn that planters shipped
                        Chinese people to the South to replace the field slaves during Reconstruction? I was. Plantation
                        owners envisioned an improved system of coerced labor, as Chinese workers were lauded as “fine
                        specimens, bright and intelligent” (<i class="calibre7">New Orleans Times</i>, June 3, 1870).
                        They were dismayed, however, when the Chinese behaved no differently from formerly enslaved
                        blacks. The new workers were unwilling to withstand the terrible conditions and ran away to the
                        cities, and sometimes vanished from the South altogether.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">After passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882&mdash;a federal law that
                        prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers until 1943&mdash;the Chinese already in the
                        United States could no longer bring their families from China. Isolated and living in the
                        margins of a country that only saw in black and white, they eventually found livelihoods outside
                        the plantations.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">I envisioned the “uncles” in this story arriving this way after the Civil War,
                        and later sojourning through the major cities of the South in search of work. Many of them
                        intermingled with local populations, yet these diverse histories were not captured by U.S.
                        Census records. That a Chinese laborer like Shang might’ve found love in the arms of someone
                        above his class wasn’t hard for me to imagine. Sometimes, as Miss Sweetie notes, love just
                        stumbles into you, out of the blue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre21">One of the things I love about writing historical fiction is how much the
                        research process affects the creative process. <i class="calibre7">The Downstairs Girl</i> takes
                        place during the period in America known as the “Gilded Age,” coined by Mark Twain to describe
                        an era of high profits and merrymaking that belied serious social problems. The more I explored
                        these social problems, the more the character of Noemi took shape. The year 1890 marked the
                        beginning of Jim Crow laws, like those segregating the streetcars. (Though, note that the law
                        segregating Atlanta’s streetcars was actually passed in 1891, one year after the events in this
                        story.) Before that, with federal troops to safeguard their new civil liberties, including
                        enfranchisement for black men, African Americans had experienced relative freedom of movement in
                        the late 1860s and early 1870s, with some African American men even winning elections to state
                        governments and Congress. But by the late 1870s, as white Southerners turned to violence to
                        protest this new interracial democracy, public support for Reconstruction began to wane. White
                        supremacist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan began to gain a foothold. In a final blow to
                        Reconstruction, Republican candidate for president Rutherford B. Hayes agreed to return the
                        South to “home rule” in exchange for Democrats certifying his contested election in a deal known
                        as the Compromise of 1876. After that, civil rights for African Americans would gradually be
                        stripped away until the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-251" class="calibre21">Black women suffered greatly with the failure of
                        Reconstruction, victims of both racism and sexism. Suffrage leaders who had worked toward the
                        idea of universal suffrage antebellum began turning their backs on their black sisters to court
                        the support of white Southern suffragists, whose interest in restoring white supremacy eclipsed
                        their interest in enfranchising women. White Southern women’s overt racism was used to justify
                        the discriminatory policies of national suffrage organizations, and black women were expected to
                        understand that it was for the greater good. Nevertheless, African American women played an
                        active role in the suffrage movement leading up to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in
                        1920, though they themselves wouldn’t be fully enfranchised until the Civil Rights Act of 1965.
