                <h2>CHAPTER 14: I BECOME A KNOWN FUGITIVE</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                                    class="calibre12">I</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">‚ÄôD LOVE TO TELL
                        YOU</span> I <span class="calibre5">HAD SOME DEEP</span> revelation on my way down, that I came
                    to terms with my own mortality, laughed in the face of death, et cetera.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The truth? My only thought was: Aaaaggghhh!</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The river raced toward me at the speed of a truck. Wind ripped the breath from my
                    lungs. Steeples and skyscrapers and bridges tumbled in and out of my vision.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">And then: <i class="calibre7">Flaaa-booom!</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">A whiteout of bubbles. I sank through the murk, sure that I was about to end up
                    embedded in a hundred feet of mud and lost forever.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">But my impact with the water hadn‚Äôt hurt. I was falling slowly now, bubbles
                    trickling up through my fingers. I settled on the river bottom soundlessly. A catfish the size of my
                    stepfather lurched away into the gloom. Clouds of silt and disgusting garbage&mdash;beer bottles,
                    old shoes, plastic bags &mdash;swirled up all around me.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">At that point, I realized a few things: first, I had not been flattened into a
                    pancake. I had not been barbecued. I couldn‚Äôt even feel the Chimera poison boiling in my veins
                    anymore. I was alive, which was good.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-223" class="calibre17">Second realization: I wasn‚Äôt wet. I mean, I could feel the
                    coolness of the water. I could see where the fire on my clothes had been quenched. But when I
                    touched my own shirt, it felt perfectly dry.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked at the garbage floating by and snatched an old cigarette lighter.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">No way, I thought.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I flicked the lighter. It sparked. A tiny flame appeared, right there at the bottom
                    of the Mississippi.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I grabbed a soggy hamburger wrapper out of the current and immediately the paper
                    turned dry. I lit it with no problem. As soon as I let it go, the flames sputtered out. The wrapper
                    turned back into a slimy rag. Weird.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">But the strangest thought occurred to me only last: I was breathing. I was
                    underwater, and I was breathing normally.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I stood up, thigh-deep in mud. My legs felt shaky. My hands trembled. I should‚Äôve
                    been dead. The fact that I wasn‚Äôt seemed like‚Ä¶well, a miracle. I imagined a woman‚Äôs voice, a voice
                    that sounded a bit like my mother: <i class="calibre7">Percy, what do you say?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶thanks.‚Äù Underwater, I sounded like I did on recordings, like a much older kid.
                    ‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶Father.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">No response. Just the dark drift of garbage downriver, the enormous catfish gliding
                    by, the flash of sunset on the water‚Äôs surface far above, turning everything the color of
                    butterscotch.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Why had Poseidon saved me? The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. So
                    I‚Äôd gotten lucky a few times before. Against a thing like the Chimera, I had never stood a chance.
                    Those poor people in the Arch were probably toast. I couldn‚Äôt protect them. I was no hero. Maybe I
                    should just stay down here with the catfish, join the bottom feeders.</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Fump-fump-fump.</i> A riverboat‚Äôs paddlewheel churned above me,
                    swirling the silt around.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">There, not five feet in front of me, was my sword, its gleaming bronze hilt
                    sticking up in the mud.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I heard that woman‚Äôs voice again: <i class="calibre7">Percy, take the sword. Your
                        father believes in you.</i> This time, I knew the voice wasn‚Äôt in my head. I wasn‚Äôt imagining
                    it. Her words seemed to come from everywhere, rippling through the water like dolphin sonar.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I called aloud.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Then, through the gloom, I saw her&mdash;a woman the color of the water, a ghost in
                    the current, floating just above the sword. She had long billowing hair, and her eyes, barely
                    visible, were green like mine.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre17">A lump formed in my throat. I said, ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">No, child, only a messenger, though your mother‚Äôs fate is not
                        as hopeless as you believe. Go to the beach in Santa Monica.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">It is your father‚Äôs will. Before you descend into the
                        Underworld, you must go to Santa Monica. Please, Percy, I cannot stay long. The river here is
                        too foul for my presence.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù I was sure this woman was my mother, or a vision of her, anyway.
                    ‚ÄúWho&mdash;how did you&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">There was so much I wanted to ask, the words jammed up my throat.</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">I cannot stay, brave one,</i> the woman said. She reached out,
                    and I felt the current brush my face like a caress. <i class="calibre7">You must go to Santa Monica!
                        And, Percy, do not trust the gifts‚Ä¶.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">Her voice faded.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGifts?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat gifts? Wait!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She made one more attempt to speak, but the sound was gone. Her image melted away.
                    If it was my mother, I had lost her again.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I felt like drowning myself. The only problem: I was immune to drowning.</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Your father believes in you,</i> she had said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She‚Äôd also called me brave‚Ä¶unless she was talking to the catfish.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I waded toward Riptide and grabbed it by the hilt. The Chimera might still be up
                    there with its snaky, fat mother, waiting to finish me off. At the very least, the mortal police
                    would be arriving, trying to figure out who had blown a hole in the Arch. If they found me, they‚Äôd
                    have some questions.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I capped my sword, stuck the ballpoint pen in my pocket. ‚ÄúThank you, Father,‚Äù I
                    said again to the dark water.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Then I kicked up through the muck and swam for the surface.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">I came ashore next to a floating McDonald‚Äôs.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">A block away, every emergency vehicle in St. Louis was surrounding the Arch. Police
                    helicopters circled overhead. The crowd of onlookers reminded me of Times Square on New Year‚Äôs Eve.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">A little girl said, ‚ÄúMama! That boy walked out of the river.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice, dear,‚Äù her mother said, craning her neck to watch the ambulances.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs dry!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice, dear.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">A news lady was talking for the camera: ‚ÄúProbably not a terrorist attack, we‚Äôre
                    told, but it‚Äôs still very early in the investigation. The damage, as you can see, is very serious.
                    We‚Äôre trying to get some of the survivors, to question them about eyewitness reports of someone
                    falling from the Arch.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Survivors.</i> I felt a surge of relief. Maybe the park ranger
                    and that family made it out safely. I hoped Annabeth and Grover were okay.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I tried to push through the crowd to see what was going on inside the police line.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚Äú‚Ä¶an adolescent boy,‚Äù another reporter was saying. ‚ÄúChannel Five has learned that
                    surveillance cameras show an adolescent boy going wild on the observation deck, somehow setting off
                    this freak explosion. Hard to believe, John, but that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre hearing. Again, no confirmed
                    fatalities‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I backed away, trying to keep my head down. I had to go a long way around the
                    police perimeter. Uniformed officers and news reporters were everywhere.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôd almost lost hope of ever finding Annabeth and Grover when a familiar voice
                    bleated, ‚ÄúPerrr-cy!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I turned and got tackled by Grover‚Äôs bear hug&mdash;or goat hug. He said, ‚ÄúWe
                    thought you‚Äôd gone to Hades the hard way!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth stood behind him, trying to look angry, but even she seemed relieved to
                    see me. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt leave you alone for five minutes! What happened?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI sort of fell.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy! Six hundred and thirty feet?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Behind us, a cop shouted, ‚ÄúGangway!‚Äù The crowd parted and a couple of paramedics
                    hustled out, rolling a woman on a stretcher. I recognized her immediately as the mother of the
                    little boy who‚Äôd been on the observation deck. She was saying, ‚ÄúAnd then this huge dog, this huge
                    fire-breathing Chihuahua&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù the paramedic said. ‚ÄúJust calm down. Your
                    family is fine. The medication is starting to kick in.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy! This boy jumped out of the hole and the monster disappeared.‚Äù Then
                    she saw me. ‚ÄúThere he is! That‚Äôs the boy!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I turned quickly and pulled Annabeth and Grover after me. We disappeared into the
                    crowd.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Annabeth demanded. ‚ÄúWas she talking about the Chihuahua on the
                    elevator?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I told them the whole story of the Chimera, Echidna, my high-dive act, and the
                    underwater lady‚Äôs message.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù said Grover. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get you to Santa Monica! You can‚Äôt ignore a
                    summons from your dad.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Before Annabeth could respond, we passed another reporter doing a news break, and I
                    almost froze in my tracks when he said, ‚ÄúPercy Jackson. That‚Äôs right, Dan. Channel Twelve has
                    learned that the boy who may have caused this explosion fits the description of a young man wanted
                    by authorities for a serious New Jersey bus accident three days ago. <i class="calibre7">And</i> the
                    boy is believed to be traveling west. For our viewers at home, here is a photo of Percy Jackson.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">We ducked around the news van and slipped into an alley.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFirst things first,‚Äù I told Grover. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get out of town!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Somehow, we made it back to the Amtrak station without getting spotted. We got on
                    board the train just before it pulled out for Denver. The train trundled west as darkness fell,
                    police lights still pulsing against the St. Louis skyline behind us.</p>
