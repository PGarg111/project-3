                <p>
                <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                                    class="calibre12">O</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">NCE</span> I
                    <span class="calibre5">GOT OVER THE FACT THAT</span> my Latin teacher was a horse, we had a nice
                    tour, though I was careful not to walk behind him. I’d done pooper-scooper patrol in the Macy’s
                    Thanksgiving Day Parade a few times, and, I’m sorry, I did not trust Chiron’s back end the way I
                    trusted his front.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">We passed the volleyball pit. Several of the campers nudged each other. One pointed
                    to the minotaur horn I was carrying. Another said, “That’s <i class="calibre7">him</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Most of the campers were older than me. Their satyr friends were bigger than
                    Grover, all of them trotting around in orange <span class="calibre5">CAMP HALF-BLOOD</span>
                    T-shirts, with nothing else to cover their bare shaggy hindquarters. I wasn’t normally shy, but the
                    way they stared at me made me uncomfortable. I felt like they were expecting me to do a flip or
                    something.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked back at the farmhouse. It was a lot bigger than I’d realized&mdash; four
                    stories tall, sky blue with white trim, like an upscale seaside resort. I was checking out the brass
                    eagle weather vane on top when something caught my eye, a shadow in the uppermost window of the
                    attic gable. Something had moved the curtain, just for a second, and I got the distinct impression I
                    was being watched.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre17">“What’s up there?” I asked Chiron.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He looked where I was pointing, and his smile faded. “Just the attic.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Somebody lives there?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No,” he said with finality. “Not a single living thing.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I got the feeling he was being truthful. But I was also sure something had moved
                    that curtain.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Come along, Percy,” Chiron said, his lighthearted tone now a little forced. “Lots
                    to see.”</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">We walked through the strawberry fields, where campers were picking bushels of
                    berries while a satyr played a tune on a reed pipe.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron told me the camp grew a nice crop for export to New York restaurants and
                    Mount Olympus. “It pays our expenses,” he explained. “And the strawberries take almost no effort.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">He said Mr. D had this effect on fruit-bearing plants: they just went crazy when he
                    was around. It worked best with wine grapes, but Mr. D was restricted from growing those, so they
                    grew strawberries instead.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I watched the satyr playing his pipe. His music was causing lines of bugs to leave
                    the strawberry patch in every direction, like refugees fleeing a fire. I wondered if Grover could
                    work that kind of magic with music. I wondered if he was still inside the farmhouse, getting chewed
                    out by Mr. D.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Grover won’t get in too much trouble, will he?” I asked Chiron. “I mean…he was a
                    good protector. Really.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron sighed. He shed his tweed jacket and draped it over his horse’s back like a
                    saddle. “Grover has big dreams, Percy. Perhaps bigger than are reasonable. To reach his goal, he
                    must first demonstrate great courage by succeeding as a keeper, finding a new camper and bringing
                    him safely to Half-Blood Hill.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“But he did that!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I might agree with you,” Chiron said. “But it is not my place to judge. Dionysus
                    and the Council of Cloven Elders must decide. I’m afraid they might not see this assignment as a
                    success. After all, Grover lost you in New York. Then there’s the unfortunate…ah…fate of your
                    mother. And the fact that Grover was unconscious when you dragged him over the property line. The
                    council might question whether this shows any courage on Grover’s part.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre17">I wanted to protest. None of what happened was Grover’s
                    fault. I also felt really, really guilty. If I hadn’t given Grover the slip at the bus station, he
                    might not have gotten in trouble.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“He’ll get a second chance, won’t he?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron winced. “I’m afraid that <i class="calibre7">was</i> Grover’s second chance,
                    Percy. The council was not anxious to give him another, either, after what happened the first time,
                    five years ago. Olympus knows, I advised him to wait longer before trying again. He’s still so small
                    for his age….”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“How old is he?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh, twenty-eight.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What! And he’s in sixth grade?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Satyrs mature half as fast as humans, Percy. Grover has been the equivalent of a
                    middle school student for the past six years.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s horrible.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Quite,” Chiron agreed. “At any rate, Grover is a late bloomer, even by satyr
                    standards, and not yet very accomplished at woodland magic. Alas, he was anxious to pursue his
                    dream. Perhaps now he will find some other career….”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s not fair,” I said. “What happened the first time? Was it really so bad?”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron looked away quickly. “Let’s move along, shall we?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre17">But I wasn’t quite ready to let the subject drop. Something
                    had occurred to me when Chiron talked about my mother’s fate, as if he were intentionally avoiding
                    the word <i class="calibre7">death</i>. The beginnings of an idea&mdash;a tiny, hopeful fire&mdash;
                    started forming in my mind.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Chiron,” I said. “If the gods and Olympus and all that are real…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes, child?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Does that mean the Underworld is real, too?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron’s expression darkened.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes, child.” He paused, as if choosing his words carefully. “There is a place
                    where spirits go after death. But for now…until we know more…I would urge you to put that out of
                    your mind.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean, ‘until we know more’?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Come, Percy. Let’s see the woods.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">As we got closer, I realized how huge the forest was. It took up at least a quarter
                    of the valley, with trees so tall and thick, you could imagine nobody had been in there since the
                    Native Americans.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron said, “The woods are stocked, if you care to try your luck, but go armed.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Stocked with what?” I asked. “Armed with what?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’ll see. Capture the flag is Friday night. Do you have your own sword and
                    shield?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“My own&mdash;?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No,” Chiron said. “I don’t suppose you do. I think a size five will do. I’ll visit
                    the armory later.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I wanted to ask what kind of summer camp had an armory, but there was too much else
                    to think about, so the tour continued. We saw the archery range, the canoeing lake, the stables
                    (which Chiron didn’t seem to like very much), the javelin range, the sing-along amphitheater, and
                    the arena where Chiron said they held sword and spear fights.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Sword and spear fights?” I asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Cabin challenges and all that,” he explained. “Not lethal. Usually. Oh, yes, and
                    there’s the mess hall.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron pointed to an outdoor pavilion framed in white Grecian columns on a hill
                    overlooking the sea. There were a dozen stone picnic tables. No roof. No walls.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What do you do when it rains?” I asked,</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre17">Chiron looked at me as if I’d gone a little weird. “We still
                    have to eat, don’t we?” I decided to drop the subject.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Finally, he showed me the cabins. There were twelve of them, nestled in the woods
                    by the lake. They were arranged in a U, with two at the base and five in a row on either side. And
                    they were without doubt the most bizarre collection of buildings I’d ever seen.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Except for the fact that each had a large brass number above the door (odds on the
                    left side, evens on the right), they looked absolutely nothing alike. Number nine had smokestacks,
                    like a tiny factory. Number four had tomato vines on the walls and a roof made out of real grass.
                    Seven seemed to be made of solid gold, which gleamed so much in the sunlight it was almost
                    impossible to look at. They all faced a commons area about the size of a soccer field, dotted with
                    Greek statues, fountains, flower beds, and a couple of basketball hoops (which were more my speed).
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">In the center of the field was a huge stone-lined firepit. Even though it was a
                    warm afternoon, the hearth smoldered. A girl about nine years old was tending the flames, poking the
                    coals with a stick.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The pair of cabins at the head of the field, numbers one and two, looked like
                    his-and-hers mausoleums, big white marble boxes with heavy columns in front. Cabin one was the
                    biggest and bulkiest of the twelve. Its polished bronze doors shimmered like a hologram, so that
                    from different angles lightning bolts seemed to streak across them. Cabin two was more graceful
                    somehow, with slimmer columns garlanded with pomegranates and flowers. The walls were carved with
                    images of peacocks.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre17">“Zeus and Hera?” I guessed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Correct,” Chiron said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Their cabins look empty.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Several of the cabins are. That’s true. No one ever stays in one or two.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Okay. So each cabin had a different god, like a mascot. Twelve cabins for the
                    twelve Olympians. But why would some be empty?</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I stopped in front of the first cabin on the left, cabin three.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">It wasn’t high and mighty like cabin one, but long and low and solid. The outer
                    walls were rough gray stone studded with pieces of seashell and coral, as if the slabs had been hewn
                    straight from the bottom of the ocean floor. I peeked inside the open doorway and Chiron said, “Oh,
                    I wouldn’t do that!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Before he could pull me back, I caught the salty scent of the interior, like the
                    wind on the shore at Montauk. The interior walls glowed like abalone. There were six empty bunk beds
                    with silk sheets turned down. But there was no sign anyone had ever slept there. The place felt so
                    sad and lonely, I was glad when Chiron put his hand on my shoulder and said, “Come along, Percy.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">Most of the other cabins were crowded with campers.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Number five was bright red&mdash;a real nasty paint job, as if the color had been
                    splashed on with buckets and fists. The roof was lined with barbed wire. A stuffed wild boar’s head
                    hung over the doorway, and its eyes seemed to follow me. Inside I could see a bunch of mean-looking
                    kids, both girls and boys, arm wrestling and arguing with each other while rock music blared. The
                    loudest was a girl maybe thirteen or fourteen. She wore a size XXXL <span class="calibre5">CAMP
                        HALF-BLOOD</span> T-shirt under a camouflage jacket. She zeroed in on me and gave me an evil
                    sneer. She reminded me of Nancy Bobofit, though the camper girl was much bigger and tougher looking,
                    and her hair was long and stringy, and brown instead of red.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I kept walking, trying to stay clear of Chiron’s hooves. “We haven’t seen any other
                    centaurs,” I observed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No,” said Chiron sadly. “My kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk, I’m afraid. You
                    might encounter them in the wilderness, or at major sporting events. But you won’t see any here.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You said your name was Chiron. Are you really…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He smiled down at me. “<i class="calibre7">The</i> Chiron from the stories? Trainer
                    of Hercules and all that? Yes, Percy, I am.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“But shouldn’t you be dead?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre17">Chiron paused, as if the question intrigued him. “I honestly
                    don’t know about <i class="calibre7">should</i> be. The truth is, I <i class="calibre7">can’t</i> be
                    dead. You see, eons ago the gods granted my wish. I could continue the work I loved. I could be a
                    teacher of heroes as long as humanity needed me. I gained much from that wish…and I gave up much.
                    But I’m still here, so I can only assume I’m still needed.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I thought about being a teacher for three thousand years. It wouldn’t have made my
                    Top Ten Things to Wish For list.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Doesn’t it ever get boring?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No, no,” he said. “Horribly depressing, at times, but never boring.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Why depressing?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron seemed to turn hard of hearing again.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh, look,” he said. “Annabeth is waiting for us.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">The blond girl I’d met at the Big House was reading a book in front of the last
                    cabin on the left, number eleven.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">When we reached her, she looked me over critically, like she was still thinking
                    about how much I drooled.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I tried to see what she was reading, but I couldn’t make out the title. I thought
                    my dyslexia was acting up. Then I realized the title wasn’t even English. The letters looked Greek
                    to me. I mean, literally Greek. There were pictures of temples and statues and different kinds of
                    columns, like those in an architecture book.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Annabeth,” Chiron said, “I have masters’ archery class at noon. Would you take
                    Percy from here?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes, sir.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Cabin eleven,” Chiron told me, gesturing toward the doorway. “Make yourself at
                    home.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Out of all the cabins, eleven looked the most like a regular summer camp cabin,
                    with the emphasis on <i class="calibre7">old</i>. The threshold was worn down, the brown paint
                    peeling. Over the doorway was one of those doctor’s symbols, a winged pole with two snakes wrapped
                    around it. What did they call it…? A caduceus.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Inside, it was packed with people, both boys and girls, way more than the number of
                    bunk beds. Sleeping bags were spread all over on the floor. It looked like a gym where the Red Cross
                    had set up an evacuation center.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre17">Chiron didn’t go in. The door was too low for him. But when
                    the campers saw him they all stood and bowed respectfully.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Well, then,” Chiron said. “Good luck, Percy. I’ll see you at dinner.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He galloped away toward the archery range.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I stood in the doorway, looking at the kids. They weren’t bowing anymore. They were
                    staring at me, sizing me up. I knew this routine. I’d gone though it at enough schools.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Well?” Annabeth prompted. “Go on.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">So naturally I tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself. There
                    were some snickers from the campers, but none of them said anything.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth announced, “Percy Jackson, meet cabin eleven.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Regular or undetermined?” somebody asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I didn’t know what to say, but Annabeth said, “Undetermined.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Everybody groaned.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">A guy who was a little older than the rest came forward. “Now, now, campers. That’s
                    what we’re here for. Welcome, Percy. You can have that spot on the floor, right over there.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The guy was about nineteen, and he looked pretty cool. He was tall and muscular,
                    with short-cropped sandy hair and a friendly smile. He wore an orange tank top, cutoffs, sandals,
                    and a leather necklace with five different-colored clay beads. The only thing unsettling about his
                    appearance was a thick white scar that ran from just beneath his right eye to his jaw, like an old
                    knife slash.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre17">“This is Luke,” Annabeth said, and her voice sounded
                    different somehow. I glanced over and could’ve sworn she was blushing. She saw me looking, and her
                    expression hardened again. “He’s your counselor for now.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“For now?” I asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’re undetermined,” Luke explained patiently. “They don’t know what cabin to put
                    you in, so you’re here. Cabin eleven takes all newcomers, all visitors. Naturally, we would. Hermes,
                    our patron, is the god of travelers.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked at the tiny section of floor they’d given me. I had nothing to put there
                    to mark it as my own, no luggage, no clothes, no sleeping bag. Just the Minotaur’s horn. I thought
                    about setting that down, but then I remembered that Hermes was also the god of thieves.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked around at the campers’ faces, some sullen and suspicious, some grinning
                    stupidly, some eyeing me as if they were waiting for a chance to pick my pockets.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“How long will I be here?” I asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Good question,” Luke said. “Until you’re determined.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“How long will that take?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The campers all laughed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Come on,” Annabeth told me. “I’ll show you the volleyball court.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’ve already seen it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Come on.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She grabbed my wrist and dragged me outside. I could hear the kids of cabin eleven
                    laughing behind me.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">When we were a few feet away, Annabeth said, “Jackson, you have to do better than
                    that.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She rolled her eyes and mumbled under her breath, “I can’t believe I thought you
                    were the one.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What’s your problem?” I was getting angry now. “All I know is, I kill some bull
                    guy&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Don’t talk like that!” Annabeth told me. “You know how many kids at this camp wish
                    they’d had your chance?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“To get killed?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“To fight the Minotaur! What do you think we train for?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre17">I shook my head. “Look, if the thing I fought really was <i
                        class="calibre7">the</i> Minotaur, the same one in the stories…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Then there’s only one.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And he died, like, a gajillion years ago, right? Theseus killed him in the
                    labyrinth. So…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Monsters don’t die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don’t die.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh, thanks. That clears it up.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“They don’t have souls like you and me. You can dispel them for a while, maybe even
                    for a whole lifetime if you’re lucky. But they are primal forces. Chiron calls them archetypes.
                    Eventually, they re-form.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I thought about Mrs. Dodds. “You mean if I killed one, accidentally, with a
                    sword&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“The Fur…I mean, your math teacher. That’s right. She’s still out there. You just
                    made her very, very mad.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“How did you know about Mrs. Dodds?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You talk in your sleep.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You almost called her something. A Fury? They’re Hades’s torturers, right?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth glanced nervously at the ground, as if she expected it to open up and
                    swallow her. “You shouldn’t call them by name, even here. We call them the Kindly Ones, if we have
                    to speak of them at all.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Look, is there anything we <i class="calibre7">can</i> say without it thundering?”
                    I sounded whiny, even to myself, but right then I didn’t care. “Why do I have to stay in cabin
                    eleven, anyway? Why is everybody so crowded together? There are plenty of empty bunks right over
                    there.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I pointed to the first few cabins, and Annabeth turned pale. “You don’t just choose
                    a cabin, Percy. It depends on who your parents are. Or…your parent.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She stared at me, waiting for me to get it.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“My mom is Sally Jackson,” I said. “She works at the candy store in Grand Central
                    Station. At least, she used to.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m sorry about your mom, Percy. But that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about
                    your other parent. Your dad.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“He’s dead. I never knew him.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre17">Annabeth sighed. Clearly, she’d had this conversation before
                    with other kids. “Your father’s not dead, Percy.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“How can you say that? You know him?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No, of course not.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Then how can you say&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Because I know <i class="calibre7">you</i>. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t
                    one of us.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You don’t know anything about me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No?” She raised an eyebrow. “I bet you moved around from school to school. I bet
                    you were kicked out of a lot of them.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“How&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Diagnosed with dyslexia. Probably ADHD, too.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I tried to swallow my embarrassment. “What does that have to do with anything?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Taken together, it’s almost a sure sign. The letters float off the page when you
                    read, right? That’s because your mind is hardwired for ancient Greek. And the ADHD&mdash;you’re
                    impulsive, can’t sit still in the classroom. That’s your battlefield reflexes. In a real fight,
                    they’d keep you alive. As for the attention problems, that’s because you see too much, Percy, not
                    too little. Your senses are better than a regular mortal’s. Of course the teachers want you
                    medicated. Most of them are monsters. They don’t want you seeing them for what they are.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You sound like…you went through the same thing?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Most of the kids here did. If you weren’t like us, you couldn’t have survived the
                    Minotaur, much less the ambrosia and nectar.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Ambrosia and nectar.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“The food and drink we were giving you to make you better. That stuff would’ve
                    killed a normal kid. It would’ve turned your blood to fire and your bones to sand and you’d be dead.
                    Face it. You’re a half-blood.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">A half-blood.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I was reeling with so many questions I didn’t know where to start.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Then a husky voice yelled, “Well! A newbie!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked over. The big girl from the ugly red cabin was sauntering toward us. She
                    had three other girls behind her, all big and ugly and mean looking like her, all wearing camo
                    jackets.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Clarisse,” Annabeth sighed. “Why don’t you go polish your spear or something?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre17">“Sure, Miss Princess,” the big girl said. “So I can run you
                    through with it Friday night.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">“Erre es korakas!”</i> Annabeth said, which I somehow
                    understood was Greek for “Go to the crows!” though I had a feeling it was a worse curse than it
                    sounded. “You don’t stand a chance.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We’ll pulverize you,” Clarisse said, but her eye twitched. Perhaps she wasn’t sure
                    she could follow through on the threat. She turned toward me. “Who’s this little runt?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Percy Jackson,” Annabeth said, “meet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I blinked. “Like…the war god?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Clarisse sneered. “You got a problem with that?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No,” I said, recovering my wits. “It explains the bad smell.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Clarisse growled. “We got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Percy.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Whatever. Come on, I’ll show you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Clarisse&mdash;” Annabeth tried to say.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Stay out of it, Wise Girl.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth looked pained, but she did stay out of it, and I didn’t really want her
                    help. I was the new kid. I had to earn my own rep.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I handed Annabeth my minotaur horn and got ready to fight, but before I knew it,
                    Clarisse had me by the neck and was dragging me toward a cinder-block building that I knew
                    immediately was the bathroom.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I was kicking and punching. I’d been in plenty of fights before, but this big girl
                    Clarisse had hands like iron. She dragged me into the girls’ bathroom. There was a line of toilets
                    on one side and a line of shower stalls down the other. It smelled just like any public bathroom,
                    and I was thinking &mdash;as much as I <i class="calibre7">could</i> think with Clarisse ripping my
                    hair out&mdash;that if this place belonged to the gods, they should’ve been able to afford classier
                    johns.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Clarisse’s friends were all laughing, and I was trying to find the strength I’d
                    used to fight the Minotaur, but it just wasn’t there.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Like he’s ‘Big Three’ material,” Clarisse said as she pushed me toward one of the
                    toilets. “Yeah, right. Minotaur probably fell over laughing, he was so stupid looking.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Her friends snickered.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth stood in the corner, watching through her fingers.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Clarisse bent me over on my knees and started pushing my head toward the toilet
                    bowl. It reeked like rusted pipes and, well, like what goes into toilets. I strained to keep my head
                    up. I was looking at the scummy water, thinking, I will not go into that. I won’t.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre17">Then something happened. I felt a tug in the pit of my
                    stomach. I heard the plumbing rumble, the pipes shudder. Clarisse’s grip on my hair loosened. Water
                    shot out of the toilet, making an arc straight over my head, and the next thing I knew, I was
                    sprawled on the bathroom tiles with Clarisse screaming behind me.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I turned just as water blasted out of the toilet again, hitting Clarisse straight
                    in the face so hard it pushed her down onto her butt. The water stayed on her like the spray from a
                    fire hose, pushing her backward into a shower stall.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She struggled, gasping, and her friends started coming toward her. But then the
                    other toilets exploded, too, and six more streams of toilet water blasted them back. The showers
                    acted up, too, and together all the fixtures sprayed the camouflage girls right out of the bathroom,
                    spinning them around like pieces of garbage being washed away.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">As soon as they were out the door, I felt the tug in my gut lessen, and the water
                    shut off as quickly as it had started.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The entire bathroom was flooded. Annabeth hadn’t been spared. She was dripping wet,
                    but she hadn’t been pushed out the door. She was standing in exactly the same place, staring at me
                    in shock.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked down and realized I was sitting in the only dry spot in the whole room.
                    There was a circle of dry floor around me. I didn’t have one drop of water on my clothes. Nothing.
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-118" class="calibre17">I stood up, my legs shaky.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, “How did you…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I don’t know.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We walked to the door. Outside, Clarisse and her friends were sprawled in the mud,
                    and a bunch of other campers had gathered around to gawk. Clarisse’s hair was flattened across her
                    face. Her camouflage jacket was sopping and she smelled like sewage. She gave me a look of absolute
                    hatred. “You are dead, new boy. You are totally dead.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I probably should have let it go, but I said, “You want to gargle with toilet water
                    again, Clarisse? Close your mouth.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Her friends had to hold her back. They dragged her toward cabin five, while the
                    other campers made way to avoid her flailing feet.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth stared at me. I couldn’t tell whether she was just grossed out or angry at
                    me for dousing her.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What?” I demanded. “What are you thinking?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m thinking,” she said, “that I want you on my team for capture the flag.”</p>
