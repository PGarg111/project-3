                <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">It’s always hard to work when your best friend is summarizing a rerun episode of <i
                        class="calibre5">Law &amp; Order: SVU.</i> Even when we’re not in the same area, Việt’s shouting
                    across the room.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You always know it’s the good-looking celebrity guy who’s the perp.” He uses the
                    term like he’s a well-seasoned cop.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Uh-huh.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I just wish that for <i class="calibre5">one</i> episode, the perp would be the
                    ugly one. You know?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I mean, the <i class="calibre5">moment</i> John Stamos came on screen, I was
                    like&mdash;<i class="calibre5">hello</i>, it’s him. The bad guy.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We’re running through our checklist of things to do at closing at ten, only a few
                    minutes away. Cold items in the fridge. Cutting boards washed down, then turned over. Each bottle of
                    hoisin and sriracha sauce filled. Eduardo, one of the line cooks, st-bumps me on his way out. He’s
                    usually the last one to go and rst to show up every morning, on the dot. He sends me a rictus of
                    pity, having been on the receiving end of Việt’s recap before.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt has his quirks&mdash;his obsession with all the weirdest police procedural or
                    forensic science shows and his near-perfect ability to quote the dialogue from them&mdash;but I
                    can’t imagine Việt without them. He’s been in my life for that long. His parents and mine would get
                    together at the restaurant&mdash;mostly after the shift ended, or when Việt’s parents were done
                    delivering supplies to various restaurants&mdash;to unwind or rant about other store owners in the
                    area. Heineken would come in at some point. While the adults talked, we’d sit underneath the tables
                    trading imaginary stories&mdash;playing cops and robbers&mdash;sharing toys with each other.
                    Sometimes we didn’t even need to talk.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-44" class="calibre12">I thought him joining the cross-country team in freshman year
                    would be the end of Việt and Bảo. That he would nd more coordinated friends who didn’t wheeze after
                    running a quarter of a mile. But I was still his best friend.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">And as Việt launches into another recap, I think: <i class="calibre5">For better or
                        for worse</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The night passed easily, the two of us having already established a rhythm with the
                    other servers. Mẹ had put a line cook’s mom, Trần’s, in charge of the kitchen so she didn’t have to
                    come in. It’s different with the server situation, though. She’s pairing me up with Việt because we
                    know each other and make decent partners. She trusts Việt to do his job, as well as make sure I do
                    mine. The concept’s not perfect: We’re the same age, and letting him watch over me makes as much
                    sense as letting a horse and a pony run the show. But somehow it works.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Trần’s mom leaves before us. I make sure the front is locked from the inside. As
                    I’m closing the blinds, I see Linh’s place is packed with customers at ten. Just for today, for that
                    special, it’s staying open for two more hours. A line wraps around the corner. Something that I’m
                    sure our place has never seen before. I’m glad Mẹ is home tonight or else she’d come and just sit
                    here and spy on people coming and going, scaring not only their customers but our own.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt joins me to peer through the blinds. “What people do for specials.” He shakes
                    his head. “We gotta one-up them, man.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Put something special on the menu.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What else should we make?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt shrugs. “Mom’s always telling me your mom makes the best <i
                        class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>&mdash; why not work with that? Like an
                    anything-you-want-in-your-crepe kind of deal. I mean, my mom has talked multiple times of poisoning
                    her to get the recipe. Which could be effective, if you think about it, since your mom needs to taste
                    a lot of things in the kitchen.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I glance over at my best friend. His mom’s known for being hawk-eyed and
                    competitive. She didn’t get to be one of the most sought-after suppliers by doing any favors. But
                    poison?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt backtracks. “But she won’t&mdash;you know, poison her. It was a joke.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-45" class="calibre12">I can’t ever imagine his mother&mdash;or his
                    father&mdash;joking.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That’s appreciated,” I reply dryly. I almost drop my blinds. Then a blur bursts
                    from the back door.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh. She escapes into the alley. “What the hell?” The customers waiting in line
                    watch her go before facing frontward again&mdash;shrugging or just shaking their heads. I glance
                    back at Việt, who’d already gone back to the kitchen. He notices no one had thought to restock the
                    fridge with beverages yet.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That was probably Trần’s fault,” I say, still distracted.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">That alley’s one-way. Where could she possibly go? And why was
                        she running?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Of course,” Việt sco s, the sound distant, before reemerging with a carton of
                    Arrowhead and kicking along another one half full of different sodas. He crouches down to start filling
                    up the fridge’s compartments. My attention alternates between him and the alley. “You gonna make me
                    do all the work here?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Linh’s been out there for a while now. Three minutes?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’ve never worked so fast. We recycle the leftover boxes, turn o the lights, then
                    go outside to lock up. As Việt pulls down the doors over the storefront, I turn toward the alley,
                    imagining Linh there, no one knowing where she’d gone. What made her run away?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">An unnamable feeling washes over me&mdash;similar to when I was looking at Ali’s
                    article, knowing, <i class="calibre5">just knowing</i>, there was a piece that did not t. I’d tried
                    to pass it over without xing it, until Ali confronted me, forcing it out of me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">This time, though, maybe I can x what’s wrong… whatever that is.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Right on the dot, I get the ten o’clock text from Ba&mdash;but really from
                    Mẹ&mdash; asking if I was finally on my way home. My thumbs hover over the keypad, my vertical bar
                    blinking slowly.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Take the long route home,” I tell Việt.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Uh, why?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Because I’m going to need to buy some more time, and I don’t want my mom wondering
                    why I’m late getting home.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why are you going to be late?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I can’t really say.” Because even I don’t know what I’m going to do.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-46" class="calibre12">Việt regards me in silence and I imagine that he gets the
                    intensity of his stare from his mother. He’s not going to do it. He’s going to ask why and what I’m
                    doing, and Linh’s never going to get out of that alley.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Tell her you stopped by my house to get a copy of a homework assignment. I’ll
                    cover for you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I blink. “Really?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah.” He shrugs. I’ve never been more thankful for his laissez-faire attitude.
                    “But you’re gonna have to tell me later what’s up.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">With a small wave, he’s o . I quickly type out my excuse to Ba, who answers with a
                    simple “Okay.” And I know it’s really Ba, because his answers are always short and right to the
                    point.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Just before I hit the opposite street, I think about turning around again. <i
                        class="calibre5">What am I doing? Maybe this is a bad idea to come over here.</i> It feels like
                    I’ve just walked past enemy lines and might step on a mine.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But now a few feet away from the alley, I hear her whispering, “Keep it together,
                    Linh! It’s not the end of the world.” She’s crouching, breathing deeply, forehead to her knees.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I clear my throat when I’m in front of her. “Um, hey. Are you okay?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Um, yeah.” She sounds like she’s about to cry. I shu e my feet.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I didn’t mean to bother you. I’m Bảo, from across the street. I don’t know if you
                    remember me, but we met that one time&mdash;” I stop. It was ages ago; she wouldn’t remember. I was
                    just a blip in her childhood.…</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I remember you,” she says slowly, blinking a few times. The question of why I’m
                    here sits heavy between us.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Rough night?” I ask, my voice catching slightly. Why do I sound like that guy in
                    about every romantic comedy? Next thing I’m going to ask is <i class="calibre5">Wanna talk about
                        it</i>? “I mean, it seems like things are busy over here.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh sighs. “It’s just hectic in there. My dad hurt his back, so we’re short one
                    person. I couldn’t breathe for a moment, and totally just ran out on the customers.” She adds,
                    almost to herself, “I feel so useless right now.” She sounds miserable. I don’t have to know her to
                    know that.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I crouch down to her level. Linh inches away instinctively, but she doesn’t leave.
                    I try to nd the right words to help her, to make her feel better, but who am I to do that? I’m
                    mostly a stranger to her. Before I can get a word out, Linh inhales deeply.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-47" class="calibre12">“Never mind.” She furiously wipes away her tears. “I’ll have
                    to go back inside.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Back when we were kids at the temple, I could have gone to any other table, sat
                    with any other kid. Instead, I ended up with her. I wonder if it wasn’t just the crafts that drew me
                    in, and if it was also her, Linh Mai, in the zone, in her natural habitat. So sure of herself, while
                    other kids were only fooling around and passing time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">This isn’t the Linh I remember.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I look at the alleyway door, imagining that it would lead us into a kitchen. I
                    assume her mother is in the kitchen, cooking, delegating tasks to the other cooks &mdash;just like
                    mine would. That’s her domain and unless an issue manifests, she usually stays there during serving
                    time. Linh’s mom wouldn’t have a reason to go up front. A plan starts to form in my head. An
                    impossible one that I hesitate to even voice. “I can help?” I clear my throat. “I mean, I can help
                    you. You know, with customers and stu . Just for tonight.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But your restaurant&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Closed a few minutes ago.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I don’t know if my mom&mdash;” She pauses, though I know what she’s suggesting. “I
                    just don’t know.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s a win-win. I won’t need to be trained,” I try to joke.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She cracks a smile, but it disappears. “If my mom or my dad were hearing this,
                    they’d think you’re just trying to spy on us.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">That type of thinking echoes what my mom would say. It’s the same kind of gossip
                    that’s passed around by my mom, the General, and her Vietnamese watch group. The truth of it pierces
                    the bubble enveloping us; the noise from inside the restaurant intrudes.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m instigating some sort of plan that Linh clearly doesn’t want to take part in. I
                    shouldn’t have even come. Annoyance runs through me&mdash;at Linh for bringing up this confusing
                    feud when I was only trying to help; at me for thoughtlessly running into this whole situation that
                    had nothing to do with me &mdash;for reasons I’m not capable of understanding right now. I should
                    just go back, return to our separate stories as background characters in each other’s small worlds.
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-48" class="calibre12">“I’m not trying to spy. And I’m not my mom <i
                        class="calibre5">or</i> my dad. I’m just… Bảo.” I back away, shoving my hands in my pockets.
                    “You know what, it’s okay. Sorry for bothering you and for butting in. Good luck.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Tomorrow, when Việt asks where I’d gone, I’ll make up a shitty excuse.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Tomorrow, everything will be back to normal, this encounter between us erased from
                    our minds.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Bảo, wait.” I pivot at my name. “Are you really serious? About helping me?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The despondence already clouding my mind eases just slightly. She still sounds
                    distrustful, but there’s a note in her voice pulling me back. I retrace my steps, standing in front
                    of her just like before, and I o er my hand&mdash;my sweaty hand. “Tonight I’m Bảo Nguyễn, some guy
                    just trying to help out on what’s clearly a stressful night.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She stares at my hand, shaking her head slightly, realizing how ridiculous it is
                    for me to do this in some alley. Still, her hand, showing traces of washed-out paint, accepts
                    mine&mdash;and releases.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh wipes her hand on her jeans.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Great.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What’s the plan?” she asks.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I can serve in the dining area. Your mom’s probably cooking in the back, right?
                    She won’t even see me. And the waiters&mdash;” I stop. <i class="calibre5">Shit. I haven’t thought
                        of that.</i> At our restaurant, Bình and the others have suffered hours of my mom’s
                    rants&mdash;about them, about customers, and especially about the Mais. They’ve been indoctrinated.
                    So it’s likely that Linh’s fellow servers have gone through the same thing. They <i
                        class="calibre5">could</i> recognize me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We have new waiters,” she adds quietly. “Which might work in our favor.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She looks away for a second. Then she pulls back her hair. I’m shocked by how long
                    it is as she hurriedly ties it all up, not caring that some strands have escaped. As the moonlight
                    hits her, as I see the tightness of her jaw set in determination, the erceness in her eyes that
                    makes me breathless for a second, I realize&mdash;</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The Linh from the temple is here.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre12">She draws back her shoulders, looking like she’s ready for
                    battle. Which I guess is accurate. “Okay, let’s do this.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We’re doing it. We’re really doing this.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Please work out</i>, I think, as I follow Linh inside.
                <p class="calibre1">The smell of phở is ubiquitous. If I close my eyes, I’m back inside my family’s
                    restaurant. We’re in a narrow hallway where employees store their bags and jackets. To the right is
                    the kitchen, bustling with the clang of pots and pans, water running, shouts from the line cooks.
                    Linh gestures for me to crouch as we get to the serving window. A woman’s voice calls her name.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Without warning, Linh shoves me back and I backpedal into the alley.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Jesus,” I mutter as I regain my footing. Is everyone stronger than me? I need to
                    work out.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Dạ</i>, Mẹ! I’m good. Sorry, things were just…” The door cuts
                    me o .</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A pause. For one frightening moment, I imagine her mom emerging from the kitchen,
                    kicking the door open&mdash;as my mom would do&mdash;and seeing me, recognizing me on sight.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Brandishing a pair of chopsticks.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I know what Vietnamese mothers are capable of doing with chopsticks. And my butt
                    cheeks definitely remember ’10 when I drank ginger ale for dessert without asking Mẹ and Ba rst.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A few seconds later, Linh pulls me back in by the hand. “Sorry,” she whispers. I
                    nod numbly, my mind suddenly still, feeling her hand in mine again. She looks down, then snatches
                    her hand away.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Trying to push past the awkwardness, I say, “I’m ready. Just tell me what needs to
                    be done.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Follow me. Act normal.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I crouch-walk past the window again. The moment I walk into the dining room, I
                    regret every step that I’d taken to get here. Though the front-of-house sta might not recognize me
                    as the enemy’s son, they’re going to notice a new guy miraculously starting on the job when they
                    needed the help the most.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-50" class="calibre12">But I’m wrong. They’re busy with their tables; one guy shoots
                    past us, muttering that he’d forgotten the drinks. Linh brings me to the reservation system to teach
                    me the layout. We use the same system, I realize, and my mind zones in, keyed to the language we’ve
                    grown up with just a street apart from each other. It’s not as hard as I thought it would be, the
                    restaurant practically being a mirror of ours.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Unbidden, Linh’s earlier insinuation and my mom’s accusing voice come through: <i
                        class="calibre5">They spied on us to learn our ways!</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">I shake away that thought. Not helping. Unlike our restaurant, though, whose walls
                    and floors have seen better days, this one has a grand statement wall with mirrors and art that might
                    have been done by Linh. I feel a icker of jealousy before Linh pulls me back to reality.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’ll stick around in the back of the room to keep an eye on the food coming out.
                    Just look for me&mdash;if you don’t see me, I’m at the window and will probably need to get dishes
                    out. But if you hear the bell and I’m not there to grab whatever’s ready, just come nd me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Got it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Linh?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I freeze, not turning for a second. A girl our age steps in front of the stand.
                    She’s wringing her hands, eyes beseeching Linh. “I’m so sorry about earlier. I should have
                    remembered to check the reservation, but now everything’s ne, I think.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s ne. Mistakes happen, but thanks for xing it, Lisa,” Linh answers quickly,
                    already grabbing my arm, but the movement catches Lisa’s eyes.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Wait&mdash;have you been working this whole time?” Lisa asks, more curious than
                    suspicious.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yes, I was… prepping in the back.” I glance at Linh, who gives me the barest of
                    nods. “But her mom noticed things were getting hectic, so I’m just jumping in.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, thank God.” The girl smiles like I just saved her life.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A customer steps up to ask for a table, allowing me and Linh to escape.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Nice!” she whispers. I hold back a smile as she points me to table four by the
                    statement wall, a couple looking to order dessert.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre12">Working at a restaurant over the years, the customers
                    themselves become a pattern, types with issues and demands you learn to manage. I always spot the
                    let’s-do-something-different-tonight crowd&mdash;the moms who think they’re being adventurous by
                    deviating from ladies’ night at Olive Garden. They’re always asking for our opinion: What’s the
                    crowd favorite? What do <i class="calibre5">you</i> suggest? What’s the most <i
                        class="calibre5">authentic</i>? Ignorance is the same no matter where you eat. When I do bother
                    to give answers, they don’t even take my suggestions.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">There are assholes who come in as a party of eight and expect to be seated within
                    ve minutes; Vietnamese women dressed up way too fancy for this type of restaurant, like Bà An who
                    comes on Tuesdays<i class="calibre5">&mdash;“Bà ngu,”</i> my mom spits out whenever she comes
                    in&mdash;and people who didn’t learn how to use chopsticks at a pliable age, but make a valiant e
                    ort, only to search helplessly for a server so they can ag down forks and spoons.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Then, there are customers who don’t even need to order; they walk right in&mdash;
                    or at least shu e in&mdash;a tide of gray and salt-and-pepper heads, and my parents know immediately
                    what they need. Most of the time, these people and my parents go way back, some even from the
                    refugee days. It’s all easier for us; they’re the least fussy of the customers.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Tonight, I’m not spotting any here, maybe because they’d know to avoid this huge
                    crowd.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">If I have an order in there, Linh slides it down to me to grab. I’m an hour in and
                    I swing to the back to get my next order. Linh’s there, elbows on the order table, speaking to
                    someone in the window. She spots me and her eyes widen, which tells me to hide, and I step back into
                    the eating area, out of view.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“… another order of <i class="calibre5">gỏi cuốn</i>?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, third order for the same table.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Third!” Her mom sounds delighted. She addresses one of the cooks, joking, “What
                    did we put in there? We’re doing good, yes?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We’re doing awesome, Mẹ!” Linh answers, catching my eye again.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She smiles brie y before bringing her order to the table.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">In my section, I eld questions about the menu, but that’s no big deal since we sell
                    similar food items. Customers ask me how many shakes we sell, and of course that’s ve&mdash;</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-52" class="calibre12">Wait, the Mais have six?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Excuse me, can I get another order of <i class="calibre5">chả giò</i>?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sure, let me just&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh shit.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Frank,” I breathe.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Frank’s ve years older than me. His mom used to work at the nail salon on the same
                    strip as us and we’d suffered through hours of their lunchtime gossip by playing games on his
                    Nintendo DS, which I’d never owned. But they’d moved somewhere else and I hadn’t seen Frank in
                    years.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We’re at a standstill, lost for excuses as to why we’re both in a competitor’s
                    restaurant. We start speaking over each other.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m just helping out a friend&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Don’t tell your mom I&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But it’s no big&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I just wanted some <i class="calibre5">chả giò</i>!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We blink at each other.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My shoulders relax when I see Frank looking sheepish. His group of friends watch
                    the exchange, amused. “Look, I know your mom would have my ass if she knew I was here. Well, rst my
                    mom would. And I’m not sure what <i class="calibre5">you’re</i> doing here, but I won’t tell if you
                    won’t.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">In any other situation, I’d laugh at the idea that a grown-ass man is still terri
                    ed of getting in trouble with two Vietnamese mothers. But now’s not the time. “Deal,” I say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Thank God. I’ve been craving these egg rolls. They’re the best in the area&mdash;
                    er, I mean, no offense to your mom.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Good decision.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Apparently Linh was watching us, and as soon as we pass each other, she leans in, a
                    hand on my elbow. “Everything okay?” This is the third time she’s touching me, and I’m finding that I
                    don’t mind at all. I was lucky and partly thankful that my mom has the skills to intimidate people
                    even if they don’t live in the area anymore.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I think so.”</p>
                <p class="calibre1">Time passes quickly. Customers have finished and left at a steady pace, allowing the
                    line to grow shorter and shorter. The deal has probably given the place a pro t. I remember my mom’s
                    snide comments about the Mais’ phở, how it’s all too bland, but from the smiles on the customers’
                    faces as they leave, I’m sure that’s not the case.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We have ve tickets left at this point. The restaurant closes soon, at midnight, and
                    my time here will end. Maybe we’ll never see each other again after tonight. Maybe this will just be
                    a uke incident. But I don’t think anyone can deny that we made a good team.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">From across the room, over a sea of heads and laughter, I catch Linh’s eye.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We got this.</p>
                <p class="calibre1">I sneak out once the servers have said goodbye to the last customers. Linh gestures
                    that she will follow in a few minutes. I wait by the alley while cleanup happens. The back door
                    opens now and again as some of the bus boys dump the trash or empty boxes. They see me, but just nod
                    indifferently, not caring that some weird guy is just waiting there in near-darkness.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh appears at the alley’s opening having gone through the front. She’s carrying
                    her messenger bag. “My mom’s just cleaning up a few things. You’re safe.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Out by the curb, some feet to the right of the restaurant’s facade, we wordlessly
                    sit down. I watch her shoulders move as she breathes, until I realize I’ve timed my breathing with
                    hers.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She speaks rst. “Tonight was…”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She trails o , a smile playing on her lips. My brain has gone to mush. More strands
                    have fallen out of her ponytail and I get the urge to move them out of her face, behind her ear.
                    They shine, like the hair of a violin bow just polished.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My hand rises of its own accord. Linh freezes; her body stills, then my brain
                    yells, <i class="calibre5">WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</i> And my hand goes o course and before I realize
