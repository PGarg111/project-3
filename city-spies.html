                <article>
                    <h2>1. <strong>A Man Called Mother</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Sara looked at the water</span> stain on the wall and
                        imagined it was an island. She wasn’t sure if that was because it actually looked like one or
                        just
                        because she so desperately wished she were in some tropical paradise far from Brooklyn and this
                        tiny
                        room on the eighth floor of Kings County Family Court.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She sat across the table from her public defender, a massive man in a rumpled
                        suit
                        named Randall Stubbs. His bulky frame hunched over as he scanned her file. “This doesn’t look
                        good,”
                        he muttered, because stating the obvious was apparently something they taught in law school.
                        “You’re
                        lucky they’ve made such a generous offer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They have?” Sara asked, surprised. “What is it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He looked up from the file and said, “You plead guilty to all charges and get
                        thirty months in juvenile detention.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Two and a half years in juvie didn’t sound generous to Sara, but it probably
                        wasn’t
                        much worse than her last few foster homes. She was tough for a twelve-year-old. She could handle
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And, of course,” he added, “you won’t be allowed near a computer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This, however, was unacceptable.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For how long?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For the duration of your sentence. Maybe longer as a condition of your
                        release.
                        That’ll be up to the judge.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre17">“But all I did was&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” he interrupted. “Hack into the computer network for the entire juvenile
                        justice system of New York City? Is that what you were going to say? Because that’s not what I’d
                        call an ‘all I did’ situation.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know, but I was only trying to …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It doesn’t matter what you were <i class="calibre8">trying</i> to do,” he
                        said.
                        “All that matters is what you did. You’re lucky you’re twelve. If you were thirteen, they
                        probably
                        would’ve bumped you up to a higher court to make an example out of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The weight of this hit her hard, and for the first time she regretted her
                        actions.
                        Not because they were against the law. Legal or not, she had no doubt that she’d done the right
                        thing. But she’d never considered that she could be banished from the one corner of the world
                        that
                        made sense to her. The only time Sara felt at home was when she was sitting at a computer
                        keyboard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll never hack again,” she said. “I promise.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Oh, you promise?” he responded sarcastically. “Maybe you can cross your heart
                        and
                        hope to die once we get in court. I’m sure that’ll fix everything.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara struggled when it came to controlling her temper, a diagnosis confirmed by
                        multiple counselors and at least two school psychologists. Still, she tried to keep cool as she
                        looked at the man who was supposed to be helping her. She couldn’t risk angering him, because he
                        was
                        her only hope for a positive outcome. So she took a deep breath and counted to ten, a tip from
                        one
                        of those counselors whose name she’d long since forgotten.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If I can’t use a computer,” she said, barely masking her desperation, “then I
                        can’t do the one thing I’m good at. The thing that makes me special.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yeah, well, you should’ve thought of that before you&mdash;”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre17">She probably would’ve lost her temper right then and there
                        if
                        the door hadn’t suddenly flown open, and into the room stepped a man who was in every way the
                        opposite of her attorney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He was tall and thin with a thatch of unruly black hair. His suit was
                        impeccable.
                        His tie matched his pocket square. And he spoke with a British accent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sorry to interrupt,” he said politely. “But I believe you’re in my seat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ve got the wrong room,” grumbled Stubbs. “Now, if you don’t mind, I’m
                        having a
                        conference with my client.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Except, according to this Substitution of Counsel form, she’s my client,” the
                        other man replied as he showed Stubbs a piece of paper. This brought an instant smile to Sara’s
                        face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Stubbs eyed the man. “That doesn’t make any sense. She can’t afford a fancy
                        lawyer
                        like you. She doesn’t have any money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Of course she doesn’t have any money. She’s twelve. Twelve-year-olds don’t
                        have
                        money. They have bicycles and rucksacks. This one, however, also happens to have an attorney.
                        This
                        paper says I’ve been retained to represent Ms. Sara Maria Martinez.” He turned to her and
                        smiled.
                        “Is that you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, sir.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brilliant. That means I’m in the right place.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who retained you?” asked the public defender.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“An interested party,” said the man. “Beyond that, it’s not your concern. So if
                        you’ll please leave, Sara and I have much to talk about. We’re due before a judge shortly.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Stubbs mumbled to himself as he shoveled his papers into his briefcase. “I’m
                        going
                        to check this out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a lovely lady named Valerie who can help you,” said the British man.
                        “She’s with the clerk of the court on the seventh floor.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre17">“I know where she is,” Stubbs snapped as he squeezed past
                        the
                        man into the hallway. He started to say something else, but instead just made a frustrated noise
                        and
                        stormed off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Once Stubbs was gone, the new attorney closed the door and sat across from
                        Sara.
                        “I’ve never seen that before,” he marveled. “He literally left the room in a huff.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She had no idea who might have hired an attorney for her, but she was certainly
                        happy with the change. “I’ve never seen it either.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Now tell me,” he said as he popped open the latches of his briefcase. “Is it
                        true?
                        Did you hack into the computers of the city’s juvenile justice system?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She hesitated to answer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You needn’t worry. Attorney-client privilege forbids me from telling anyone
                        what
                        you say in here. I just need to know if it’s true.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She gave a slight nod. “Yes. It’s true.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brilliant,” he said with a wink. He pulled a small computer from his briefcase
                        and
                        handed it to her. “I need you to do it again.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do what again?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hack into the juvenile justice database,” he said. “I need you to make me your
                        attorney of record before Mr. Stubbs gets to the seventh floor and checks for himself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You mean you’re not my attorney?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Never set foot in a law school,” he said conspiratorially. “So chop-chop. I’ve
                        got
                        an associate who’s going to delay him in the hallway, but she’ll only be able to do that for so
                        long.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara’s head was spinning. She didn’t know what to think. “Listen, I don’t know
                        who
                        you are, but the court’s supposed to assign me a lawyer. A <i>real</i> one.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre17">“And the chap with the mustard stain on his tie is the one
                        it
                        assigned,” he replied, shaking his head. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not particularly
                        impressed. Over the last nine years, that same court has assigned you to six foster families and
                        nine schools. It’s been one botch job a er another with them. What do you say we try something
                        new?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She looked at him and then at the computer. She was tempted, but she was also
                        confused. “I don’t think—”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What did he say would happen?” he interrupted. “I bet he’s
                        already worked out a deal with the prosecutor.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Two and a half years in juvie and I’m banned from using a computer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He shook his head. “I can do better than that even without a law degree.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For reasons she didn’t fully understand, Sara believed him. Maybe it was
                        wishful
                        thinking. Maybe it was desperation. Either way, she trusted her gut and started typing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent,” he said. “You probably won’t regret this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">“Probably?”</i> She raised an eyebrow.“Shouldn’t you be
                        trying
                        to build up my confidence?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Only fools and liars speak with certainty about things beyond their control,”
                        he
                        replied. “But I’m optimistic, so I’d rate your chances around … eighty-seven percent.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara smiled and continued typing. “What kind of computer is this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Bespoke,” he answered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I thought I knew all the computer companies, but I’ve never</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">heard of that one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s not a company,” he said. “ ‘Bespoke’ means something has</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">been tailor-made to the specific needs of an individual.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Someone made this for you?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre17">He nodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, whoever ‘bespoke’ it really knew what they were doing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wait until you see the massive one,” he said. “You’re going to love it. That
                        is,
                        if we’re not both behind bars by the end of the day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara knew computers well, but she’d never seen one like this. It was fast and
                        powerful, and she quickly shredded through the firewall that was supposed to protect the
                        juvenile
                        justice portal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They didn’t even fix the backdoor I used the other day,” she said in
                        disbelief.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Large institutions move slowly,” he said. “Hopefully large attorneys do too.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It took her less than two minutes to reach the database for attorney
                        assignments.
                        She happily deleted the entry for Randall Stubbs and asked, “What’s your name?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent question,” he said as he pulled three passports out of his
                        briefcase.
                        “Which sounds best?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He read from the first one. “Croydon St. Vincent Marlborough the Third.” He
                        gave a
                        sour face. “Seems a bit excessive, don’t you think?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded. “Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’ll pass on that.” He read from the next. “Nigel Honeybuns.” This one made
                        him
                        snicker. “Honeybuns? I quite like that.” He tucked it into a pocket in his briefcase. “I think
                        I’ll
                        save that one for another time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re kind of in a hurry,” she reminded him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right, right, here we go,” he said, reading from the last one. “Gerald
                        Anderson.
                        That sounds like a proper barrister. Dull. Boring. Imminently forgettable. Which is exactly what
                        we
                        want. That’s my name, Gerald Anderson.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre17">He handed her the passport so she could check the spelling
                        as
                        she typed it into the database.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I just click ‘update,’ ” she said as she finished, “and we’re all set.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He flashed a nervous smile and paused to listen. “No alarms.” He opened the
                        door
                        and leaned out into the hallway. “No one rushing in to arrest us. Very nice work, Sara.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Except now I have an attorney who’s never gone to law school.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve watched a ton of courtroom dramas on the telly,” he said. “I can handle
                        an
                        appearance before a judge.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t you mean ‘<i class="calibre8">probably</i>’?” she replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He smiled at this. “Right … <i class="calibre8">probably</i>. First, though,
                        I’ll
                        need details about the hack.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m sure they’re all in there,” she said, pointing at the file.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This only tells me what you did,” he replied. “I want to know the reason.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The lawyer, you know, the one who actually went to law school, said it didn’t
                        matter why I did it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It may not matter to him. It might not even matter to the judge. But it
                        matters
                        very much to me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She thought about her answer for a moment, trying to come up with the most
                        straightforward way to tell it. She didn’t want to get upset. She hated showing emotions in
                        front of
                        anyone. “My most recent foster parents …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Leonard and Deborah Clark?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yeah, them,” she said with a sneer. “They like to take in more kids than they
                        have
                        room for because the state pays them by the kid. More kids mean more money, whether they spend
                        it on
                        us or not. No one really checks that. We were crammed into bedrooms that were too small. Rather
                        than
                        give everyone a meal, they put food in the middle of the table, so it looked like there was more
                        than there was. They called it ‘family style,’ which is a joke because they treated us like
                        anything
                        but a family</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A new kid named Gabriel came about a month ago. He was scared. Sad. Lonely.
                        Everything you’d expect from a five-year-old. He liked me because we were the only Hispanic kids
                        in
                        the house.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You spoke Spanish to him?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sometimes,” she said. “Until they made us stop. Mr. Clark told me, ‘You’re in
                        America now, so speaking English is something you’re going to have to get used to.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The lawyer shook his head. “And what did you say to that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I pointed out that Puerto Rico was already part of America, that I’d spent
                        almost
                        my entire life in Brooklyn, and that if <i>he</i></p> really wanted to speak English well, he
                    shouldn’t end sentences with prepositions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The man laughed. “Cheeky.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not exactly sure what ‘cheeky’ means, but his cheeks turned red, so I
                        guess
                        so,” she replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Did you get in trouble?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded, the humor of the moment gone. “I could handle his punishment,
                        though.
                        It was Gabriel who couldn’t.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why was Gabriel punished?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She paused and saw him studying her expression. He wanted to watch her eyes as
                        she
                        spoke.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“One night he wet his bed,” she answered, “and to punish him, they locked him
                        in
                        the hall closet. I could hear him crying. They didn’t care. They would’ve let him cry all night.
                        So,
                        I got up and let him out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And then what happened?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then they locked me in the closet with him. Told me I had to</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">learn my place. So, I picked the lock from the inside and let us both out.” She
                        was
                        on the verge of tears, so she stopped for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And then?” he prodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They locked us outside on the roof. They le us there all night. It was cold.
                        It
                        was terrifying. The next morning, I went to school, got a pass to the computer lab, and started
                        working. First I hacked the juvenile justice database to see how many kids had been sent to the
                        Clarks. Then I hacked their bank accounts to show how much money they were taking in and where
                        they
                        were actually spending it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re not being charged with hacking the bank,” he said, flipping through
                        some
                        pages.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She grinned. “Yeah, they dropped their complaint. I’m pretty sure they don’t
                        want
                        the world to find out that a twelve-year-old girl beat their security system.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nice,” he said. “I might be able to use that later. What’d you do with this
                        information once you’d gotten it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I sent everything to my social worker,” she said. “And you know how stupid I
                        am?
                        When I saw the police coming up to the house, I thought they were going to arrest the two of
                        them.
                        For about forty-five seconds I was happy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But they arrested you instead?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Clarks even had the other kids line up on the porch so they would see me
                        being
                        led out of the house in handcuffs.” She closed her eyes tight, determined not to let a single
                        tear
                        fall. “They said, ‘This is what happens to criminals.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He’d actually heard the story the night before, through a listening device. But
                        he
                        liked hearing stories twice. He wanted to see if they changed. That was always a good indicator
                        of
                        how truthful they were. Besides, seeing her face as she recalled it told him everything he
                        needed to
                        know.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s a good reason,” he said. “I can work with that. I can make this a lot
                        better.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t you mean ‘<i class="calibre8">probably</i>’?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He smiled warmly. “No, I’m certain I can. But I’ll need you to do something
                        difficult. Something the reports in this file say you’re completely incapable of.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s that?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I need you to trust me,” he said. “No matter what I say or do, I need you to
                        trust
                        me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How can I trust you?” she asked. “I don’t even know your name.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sure you do. It’s Nigel Honeybuns. It’s Gerald Anderson. Sometimes it’s even
                        Croydon St. Vincent Marlborough the Third. It all depends on the situation,” he said with a
                        shrug.
                        “But my friends and colleagues, and I do hope that’s a group you’ll soon consider yourself to be
                        a
                        part of, they all call me Mother.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For the first time since she’d been arrested, Sara laughed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Mother? That’s an unusual name for a man.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“True,” he said, smiling at her. “But I’m an unusual man, wouldn’t you say?”
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. <strong>Crunchem Hall</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                    <p> The reports in Sara's file were accurate. She didn’t trust people. Especially adults. To be
                        fair,not
                        many had given her reason to do so. There’d been a few nice teachers along the way. And two
                        good foster families. But that was about it. Now, as she sat in a holding cell waiting to be
                        called
                        into the courtroom, she was having second thoughts about trusting a man who called himself
                        Mother
                        and
                        carried at least three phony passports in his briefcase. </p>
                    <p>"Rich girl, you gonna help me out?"</p>
                    <p>There were only three other girls in the cell, but it took Sara a moment to realize this one was
                        talking to her. She almost laughed at the absurdity of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I'm not rich."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They were sitting on blue wooden benches facing each other, about four feet apart. The older,
                        much
                        larger girl leaned closer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I saw your lawyer,” she said. “Shiny suit. Expensive shoes. You’ve gotta have money to have a
                        lawyer like that. Maybe he can help me out too. Or maybe I can look after you. Keep you safe
                        once we
                        get to juvie. It won’t cost your family much.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Leave her along."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The warning came from an unlikely source, a girl named Emily who’d shared a cell with Sara the
                        night
                        before. Her perfectly manicured nails gave the impression that she knew her way around the salon
                        much better than she did a jail cell. She’d told Sara that she’d been arrested for shoplifting
                        and
                        her mother was making her spend the night behind bars to teach her a lesson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "No one was talking to you, princess," the first girl said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Well, if Sara needs anyone to look after her, I'll do it," Emily replied. "So thanks, but no
                        thanks."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first girl stood and towered over them, her attention now fully focused on Emily. "How do
                        you
                        plan on protecting anybody?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Really, guys,” Sara said, trying to calm the situation. “It’s all a misunderstanding. I don’t
                        have
                        any money. And I don’t need any protection.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emily ignored her and got up in the other girl’s face. “I’ll just use these,” she said, flashing
                        her
                        thumbs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "What? You gonna text someone for help on that phone you shoplifted?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “No,” Emily replied flatly. “I’m going to do this.” With lightning speed, she jabbed her thumbs
                        deep
                        into the sides of the larger girl’s rib cage, making her gasp for air and stagger backward. Sara
                        stared in amazement as Emily reached over and carefully guided the other girl back to the bench,
                        making sure she didn’t fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’ll hurt for a while, maybe bruise a bit, but there’s no real damage,” Emily said in a
                        half-whisper. “I can’t promise I’ll go as easy on you next time, so you might want to think
                        twice
                        before you threaten anyone else.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara sat there amazed and was still trying to make sense of it all when a guard came to the
                        door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Martinez, Sara," he announced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She was too distracted to respond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Martinez, Sara," he repeated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "That's me."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Time for court," he said, unlocking the cell door.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sara looked back at Emily, who said, "Good luck in there."</p>
                    <p>“Thanks,” she replied as she got up and started to leave. She nodded toward the girl who was
                        still
                        catching her breath. “Thanks for that, too.”</p>
                    <p>
                        Emily smiled. "It's what cell sisters do, right?"
                    </p>
                    <p>Sara followed the guard into the courtroom. Her mind was still distracted by what had happened
                        between the two girls as she sat at the defendant’s table next to Mother.</p>
                    <p>"You all right?" he asked when he saw her expression.</p>
                    <p>
                        "Yeah," she said. "I'm fine."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Good, because I need your full attention,” he said. “And I need you to remember the part about
                        trusting me.”</p>
                    <p>She didn’t know what to make of him, but there wasn’t any time to figure it out. The bailiff
                        stood
                        and announced the judge’s entrance.</p>
                    <p>“All rise for the Honorable Lyman J. Pancake. Court is now in session.”</p>
                    <p>Mother smirked. “Pancake? Maybe I should’ve gone with Honeybuns aer all. We would’ve been like a
                        breakfast buffet.”</p>
                    <p>Sara didn’t laugh. She wasn’t in a joking mood.</p>
                    <p>Neither was the Honorable Lyman J. Pancake.</p>
                    <p>He might’ve had a funny name, but the rest of him appeared completely humorless. Perhaps a
                        lifetime
                        of listening to flapjack jokes had worn away his good nature. His expression could best be
                        described
                        as puckered, as if he’d just drunk lemonade without enough sugar. What little hair he had left
                        formed a semicircle of white bristle that started above his ears and met somewhere in the back.
                        After some formalities he asked, “How does the defendant plead?”</p>
                    <p>Mother looked up from his briefcase long enough to announce, “Guilty, Your Honor.”</p>
                    <p>
                        Sara knew she was guilty but thought there’d be some negotiations before they admitted it. From
                        what
                        she’d seen on television, guilty people usually started off claiming to be innocent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The judge turned to the prosecuting attorney and asked, “Is there a plea arrangement, Ms.
                        Adams?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prosecutor was tall and lean with short blond hair. Her youthful face hinted that she’d only
                        been out of law school for a few years, and her huge smile indicated she was delighted, if
                        perhaps a
                        bit surprised, to hear the guilty plea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “No, Your Honor,” she replied. “I had preliminary discussions with Ms. Martinez’s original
                        attorney,
                        but no agreement was reached.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “She looks really happy,” Sara whispered nervously. “I don’t think you were supposed to plead
                        guilty.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Is that true, Mr. Anderson?” asked the judge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather than respond, Mother kept shuffling through his papers. It took Sara a moment to realize
                        that
                        it was because he didn’t recognize his phony name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Is that true, Mr. Anderson?” the judge repeated, this time a bit louder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara nudged him. “<i>You’re</i> Mr. Anderson.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oops,” he whispered to her. “Told you it was forgettable.” He turned his attention to the judge
                        and
                        asked, “Is what true, Your Honor?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That you have not reached a plea arrangement with the prosecution?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s my understanding that opposing counsel has offered a sentence of two and a half years in
                        juvenile detention,” Mother said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That may have been discussed as one of several possibilities,” the prosecutor replied with a
                        Cheshire cat grin. “But like I said, there was no official agreement. And now that there’s an
                        admission of guilt in open court, I’m not inclined to let her off so easy.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara slumped in her chair. Things were going from bad to worse in a hurry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That’s fine,” said Mother. “Because we find that offer unsatisfactory.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I guarantee you won’t get a better one,” she said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I don’t want a better one,” he replied. “I want one that’s worse.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now Sara was really confused.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I’m sorry, what?” asked the judge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Thirty months just isn’t enough,” Mother replied. “My client compromised highly secure computer
                        files. And, although it’s not listed among the charges, she also hacked into the financial
                        records
                        of a multinational bank.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Hey,” protested Sara. “What about attorney-client privilege?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That would only apply if I was actually an attorney,” he whispered. He turned back to the judge
                        and
                        continued, “Your Honor, this behavior is serious and calls for more than two and a half years.
                        Personally, I think she should remain in custody until she turns eighteen.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “What are you doing?” Sara pleaded under her breath. “That’s six years.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “One moment, Your Honor,” he said, raising a finger. “I need to confer with my client.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mother leaned over so that he was right next to Sara’s ear. “As crazy as this sounds, this is
                        the
                        part where I need you to trust me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “But you’re arguing for a harsher penalty than they offered,” she said. “That doesn’t make
                        sense.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It will when I’m done,” he replied. “Just give me ninety seconds.” He unclasped his watch and
                        held
                        it up for her. “Then you can decide.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first time she noticed the back of his left hand was covered with burn scars. They
                        continued
                        up past his wrist and disappeared beneath his sleeve. Somehow, she’d overlooked them earlier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “A fire,” he said, reading her reaction. “I’ll tell you about it when we get out of here. But
                        now
                        I’m asking for a minute and a half of trust.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oddly, the scars were what swayed her. They hinted that there was more to him than fast talk and
                        a
                        nice suit. He’d suffered through something, which meant he was tough. Maybe even as tough as
                        her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She took the watch and examined it. “Looks pretty cheap for someone who’s supposed to be a
                        high-priced attorney.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I keep meaning to get a posh one,” he said. “Maybe we can take care of that once we’re done
                        here.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, she nodded her assent. “Okay … but at ninety-one seconds I start telling the judge
                        about
                        fake passports.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Attagirl.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Your Honor, if I may?” interjected the prosecutor. “We can quickly draft an agreement placing
                        Ms.
                        Martinez in a supervised group home until her eighteenth birthday.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Also unsatisfactory,” said Mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Aren’t you the one who just said she should remain in custody until she becomes an adult?” she
                        asked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Yes, but not at a place like that,” said Mother. “All she’ll do there is learn how to be a
                        better
                        criminal. I have an alternative in mind.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-21" class="calibre17">Sara watched the second hand intently. He was down to a
                        minute
                        and seven seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Where?” asked the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall,” replied Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall?” Pancake asked, trying to place the name.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a specialized facility that houses a handful of juvenile offenders,” he
                        replied. “She’ll get one-on-one attention, counseling, and a first-rate education.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are we placing her in detention or sending her to summer camp?” asked the
                        prosecutor. “The taxpayers aren’t footing the bill for that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“All the fees will be paid by a private foundation,” Mother said, waving a
                        sheet of
                        paper from his briefcase. “I have the documentation right here. Sara Martinez will no longer
                        cost
                        the taxpayers a penny.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara didn’t know what to think when she saw the “documentation.” It was a
                        takeout
                        menu from a nearby deli. According to the watch, he was down to twenty-six seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It sounds too good to be true,” said the judge. “Which undoubtedly means it
                        is. We
                        don’t reward criminal behavior with luxury accommodations. Ms. Martinez broke the law, and she
                        will
                        be going into a supervised group home when we’re done here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Ten seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You might want to rethink that,” said Mother. “She either goes to Crunchem
                        Hall or
                        we change our plea to ‘not guilty’ and move on to a trial that I can guarantee both of you will
                        regret.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why is that?” asked the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother paused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">His time was up, and he looked at Sara. She was torn. She didn’t know where
                        this
                        was going, but it seemed to being going … <i class="calibre8">somewhere</i>. He had a fake name,
                        no
                        legal training, and his key piece of evidence was a list of twenty-seven different sandwiches.
                        He
                        also told lies with alarming ease. Yet, despite all of this, he seemed totally pleased with how
                        events were unfolding. She handed him back the watch, and he smiled.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This is about to get fun,” he whispered to her confidently.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother turned to the judge. “If we go to trial, the first thing I’ll do is
                        insist
                        you remove yourself from the case.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On what grounds?” he protested.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On the grounds that you’re prejudiced against my client because when she
                        hacked
                        the juvenile justice portal, she came across personal e-mails of yours that are embarrassing in
                        nature.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara had no idea what he was talking about. She hadn’t gotten near any e-mails.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The e-mail server wasn’t compromised,” insisted the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then how do I have a copy of this note you sent two weeks ago?” Mother said,
                        and
                        began to read from a piece of paper. “ ‘Yesterday I had dinner with the mayor, and let me tell
                        you
                        that man is an absolute&mdash;’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The judge slammed his gavel repeatedly to keep Mother from reading any further.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why don’t I just put that one down for a second?” Mother said as he laid it on
                        the
                        defense table. “There are also e-mails from various attorneys, such as this one,” he said as he
                        began to read from another. “ ‘How can you take a man seriously when his name is Judge Pancake?
                        Where’d he go to law school? Hash Brown University?’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Objection!” the prosecutor exclaimed as soon as she recognized it as an e-mail
                        she’d written to a friend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He should object, not you,” said Mother. “It’s his name you’re making fun of.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre17">“Your Honor, he’s trying to blackmail us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother laughed. “No, that’s not blackmail. But this next one’s pretty close.”
                        He
                        picked up another paper and started to read. “ ‘About the legal conference last week in Atlantic
                        City, please don’t tell my wife any of …’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Order in the court!” the judge bellowed, pounding his gavel. “Order in the
                        court!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked up at Mother, and he shot her a wink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He turned back to the judge. “There are dozens of such e-mails, and I will make
                        sure that every one is read aloud and placed into the public record, which I can only imagine
                        will
                        be embarrassing for both of you. Or …” He stopped speaking for a moment to give the judge a
                        chance
                        to consider his options.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Tell me more about Crunchem Hall,” said the judge. “Who’s in charge there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Trunchbull,” said Mother. “Very tough.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right, Warden Trunchbull,” the judge said. “Tough … but fair, if I remember
                        correctly. Tell me more.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Four hours later Sara Maria Martinez was released from custody into the care of
                        a
                        man claiming to be Gerald Anderson, attorney-at-law. He signed a few papers, and they exited the
                        courthouse through a revolving door into a sunny Brooklyn afternoon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara took a deep breath of fresh air and asked, “So do you want to explain what
                        happened in there?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We won,” said Mother. “Bit of a drubbing, if I’m being honest.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not so sure we can call that a victory,” she replied. “You got me
                        sentenced to
                        six years in custody.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre17">“True, but they’re to be served at a fictional facility,
                        so it
                        shouldn’t be too difficult.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a look. “What are you talking about?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall is the school in <i class="calibre8">Matilda</i>,” he explained.
                        “Miss Trunchbull is the evil headmistress. They only exist in a children’s book.” He paused for
                        a
                        moment and added, “Unless you count the movie and the musical, both of which I quite enjoyed.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are you insane?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I only had ninety seconds, and I needed to come up with something,” he said.
                        “The
                        trick was using names that were vaguely recognizable. That way they were more likely to think it
                        was
                        real.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But what if they remembered the book?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The prosecutor seemed too young to have kids, and the judge is old enough that
                        it’s been decades since he read any bedtime stories, so I thought we were probably safe.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Again with the ‘probably.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Life is filled with ‘probablies,’ Sara. You’re going to have to get
                        comfortable
                        with them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If it’s a fictional place, then why did you insist on me being sentenced until
                        I
                        was eighteen?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because you’re no longer the concern of the juvenile courts,” he said. “You’ve
                        been sent away until you’re an adult. No one’s going to come looking for you. No social worker’s
                        going to follow up and knock on your door. You’ve fallen through the cracks of the American
                        judicial
                        system.” He smiled proudly. “So cheers for that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re saying I’m free?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In every way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then what happens now?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Now, it gets interesting,” he said. “You’ve got some massive decisions to
                        make.
                        But first I’d like you to come for a ride.” He motioned toward a limousine waiting nearby. “I
                        want
                        to show you something.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In a limo?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I figured you came here handcuffed in the back of a panda car; the least we
                        can do
                        is leave in style.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Panda car?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A police car,” he explained. “It’s black and white, like a panda.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As she followed him, she asked, “So what made you think of <i
                            class="calibre8">Matilda</i>?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It was written by Roald Dahl,” he said. “He’s my favorite author.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You must really like kids’ books.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I do, but that’s not why he’s my favorite,” said Mother. “He’s my favorite
                        because
                        in addition to being a writer, he was a spy.” Mother stopped, turned back to face her, and said,
                        “Just like me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara laughed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not joking,” he said. “I’m an agent with the British Secret Intelligence
                        Service, also known as MI6. That’s why I have the passports. That’s how I have copies of their
                        e-mails. I command an elite team that is only sent out on high-priority missions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And one of those <i class="calibre8">high-priority</i> missions was keeping me
                        out
                        of juvenile detention?” she replied suspiciously.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This wasn’t a mission so much as it was a recruitment. An emergency one, at
                        that.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re about to go into the field for a critical operation,” he said. “And we
                        just
                        discovered that we need one more person on our team. We thought we’d come over and see if that
                        person might be you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-26" class="calibre17">Mother opened the rear door of the limo, and Sara saw a
                        familiar face looking back at her from inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Emily?” she said, recognizing her “cell sister.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Actually, the name’s Sydney,” she replied with an Australian accent. “Glad he
                        was
                        able to bust you out.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>3.</strong> Brooklyn</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Rather than a prisoner transport</span> bus, Sara left
                        the
                        courthouse in a limousine with two people who claimed to be spies. Surprisingly, she had no
                        doubt
                        that that’s exactly what they were. She just wasn’t sure how she fit into their plans.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me get this straight,” she said as they took Atlantic Avenue deeper into
                        Brooklyn. “You two are a team?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Part of one,” answered Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you came here to see if I was a good fit for that team?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s right,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Am I?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So far, it’s quite promising,” he said, “but we can’t be certain until we
                        conduct
                        some more tests.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean, <i class="calibre8">more</i> tests?” she said. “I haven’t
                        taken
                        any.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Actually, you’ve taken two so far,” he answered. “First when I asked you to
                        hack
                        into the juvenile justice portal and make me your attorney. That’s performance under pressure.
                        An
                        essential skill.” He turned to Sydney. “She did it in under two minutes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Impressive,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The second was trusting me in the courtroom,” he continued. “That demonstrated
                        your ability to adapt to rapidly changing situations. Also essential.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I wish I could’ve been there to see it,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s too bad,” joked Mother. “I was sensational.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-28" class="calibre17">Sydney rolled her eyes and shared a look with Sara. “By
                        the
                        way, I did some shopping earlier.” Sydney handed her two department store bags. “I tried to
                        guess
                        your sizes and what you might like.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked in the bags. “You bought me clothes?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just to hold you over until we can get you a proper wardrobe,” she replied.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Although, most days you’ll wear your school uniform,” added Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a curious look. “My school doesn’t have a uniform.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“About that. You’re going to be enrolled in a new school called Kinloch Abbey.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sounds about as fake as Crunchem Hall,” she said. “Let me guess. It’s from <i
                            class="calibre8">James and the Giant Peach</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, this one’s not in a book,” Mother said. “It’s in Scotland.” Sara waited
                        for
                        him to laugh, but he didn’t. She waited some more, but there was still no laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re serious?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a bit posh,” said Sydney. “After all, part of it’s in a castle. But once
                        you
                        get over that, you’ll like it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re going to Scotland?!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Instead of answering, Mother leaned toward the driver and asked, “Can you
                        please
                        turn left and take us to house number 197?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re pressed for time,” Sydney reminded him. “If we miss this flight, we’ll
                        lose
                        an entire day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know, I know,” he reassured her. “It’s just a quick detour for context.
                        Besides,
                        I really want to see it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m sorry,” Sara interrupted, “but can we get back to the whole Scotland
                        thing?”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-29" class="calibre17">“Shortly,” Mother assured her as the limo parked in front
                        of a
                        three-story redbrick town house. “First, tell me what you know about Winston Churchill.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Absolutely nothing,” she said blankly. “The name sounds … kind of familiar,
                        but
                        that’s it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Jaw-dropping,” he said disapprovingly. “Kinloch will take care of that in a
                        tick.
                        But, for now, just know that as prime minister during World War Two, Churchill saved Britain and
                        quite possibly the world from annihilation. He’s a personal hero of mine and did more for the
                        British Secret Intelligence Service than anyone else.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” she said. “So why are you telling me this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because his mother was born in this house.” He gestured out the window. “Think
                        about that. The mother of the man who saved Britain wasn’t from London or Oxford or some grand
                        estate out in Surrey. She was from Brooklyn, just like you. So it follows that we’d come full
                        circle
                        back here to find you. Brooklyn’s imprinted on our DNA.” He turned his attention back to the
                        driver.
                        “Okay,we can move along now.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo started again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s interesting and all,” said Sara. “But it really doesn’t answer my
                        question.
                        Are you seriously taking me to Scotland? Because I don’t even have a passport.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He popped open his briefcase and handed her two British passports, each with
                        her
                        picture and a phony name. “Pick the one you like better.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Of course,” she replied, shaking her head. “You have all the passports you
                        want.
                        How’d you get this picture of me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That bit about us being spies?” he said. “We’re exceptionally good at getting
                        things. As to your first question, yes, we’re taking you to Scotland. Whether you stay there or
                        not,
                        however, will be entirely up to you.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-30" class="calibre17">“How do you mean?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Soon you’ll start classes at Kinloch. It’s one of the top boarding schools in
                        the
                        UK. You’ll get a first-rate education. And if you’re happy there, you can continue until you
                        graduate and leave for university. That’s option one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And if I don’t like it?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Option two,” he answered. “If, at the end of the school year, you decide
                        Kinloch’s
                        not right for you or that you miss living in the States too much, we’ll find you a proper home
                        back
                        here in America. It won’t be like the ones you’ve been stuck in before. We’ll get you a good
                        family.
                        I’ll see to that. Although, we might want to avoid metropolitan New York because of the whole
                        business about them believing that you’re in detention somewhere.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Good point,” she said. “But what does any of that have to do with spies and
                        MI6?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not a thing.” He leaned in conspiratorially and added, “Option three is the
                        one
                        that involves the Secret Intelligence Service.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She looked at both of them before saying, “Then option three is the one I want
                        to
                        hear about.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You attend Kinloch not as a boarder but as a day student,” said Sydney. “And
                        you
                        live at the farm with Monty, me, and the rest of the team.” “Monty?” asked Sara. “Who’s that?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Dr. Alexandra Montgomery,” said Mother. “She’s a
                        biophysicist-slash-cryptologist
                        who loves to bake. Think of her as part Marie Curie and part Mary Poppins.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She’s brilliant,” said Sydney. “You’re going to love her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And the rest of the team?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Kids like you and me who Mother’s found around the globe,” said Sydney.
                        “They’re
                        amazing.” She rethought this for a moment. “I mean, the boys totally drive me bonkers and I
                        usually
                        want to strangle them, but other than that they’re amazing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How many are there?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Two boys and another girl,” she said. “Paris, Rio, and Kat. When you join the
                        team, you have to create an entirely new identity. It’s hard to keep track of all the aliases
                        and
                        fake names, so we just call each other by where we’re from. That way we still have a small
                        connection to our past.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a city called Kat?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Kathmandu,” answered Mother. “It’s in Nepal but that’s rather a mouthful, so
                        we
                        just go with Kat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That means I’d be Brooklyn,” Sara said, liking the sound of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">If</i> you decide to join,” stressed Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What does <i class="calibre8">joining</i> even mean?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It means that in addition to your studies at Kinloch,” he said, “you’ll
                        receive
                        instruction in espionage, counterintelligence, self-defense, code-breaking, and other assorted
                        goodies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“My favorite assorted goody is explosives,” said Sydney. “I like making things
                        go
                        boom.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So we’re talking spy school?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” said Mother. “But not just school. We go on real missions. We face
                        genuine
                        danger.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you said that there’s a mission coming up that you want me to go on,” Sara
                        replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother sighed. “Normally, you receive extensive training before you go into the
                        field, but we’re in a pinch at the moment. There’s an operation in three weeks, and we find
                        ourselves one person down.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And if that person’s me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then I would limit your role as much as possible, but you would have to go
                        into
                        the field with us.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-32" class="calibre17">“Cool,” she said with a grin. “Sounds more fun than
                        juvenile
                        detention.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara would’ve asked more about the upcoming mission, but she was distracted
                        when
                        the limo turned down a familiar street. It was >her neighborhood and just the sight of it made
                        her
                        wince. Everything here was the opposite of boarding schools and castles. There were chain-link
                        fences with razor wire, iron bars on windows, and graffiti covering the wall of an abandoned
                        warehouse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why are we here?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re about to cross an ocean,” he answered. “I thought you might like to stop
                        by
                        home before we left .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This isn’t my <i class="calibre8">home</i>,” she corrected. “It’s a <i
                            class="calibre8">house</i> where I lived. There’s a huge difference.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Duly noted,” he said. “But either way, you won’t be returning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">If there’s anything of sentimental value in there, now’s the time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a shoebox with some things that are special to me,” she said. “But I
                        can’t
                        get it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why not?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Clarks are home,” she said. “Considering I just tried to have them
                        arrested, I
                        doubt they’ll hand it over.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then let’s not tell them,” he replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You want me to break in?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In the spy trade we call it a ‘black bag job,’ ” he said. “We’ll make this
                        your
                        first alpha test.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This brought a smile to Sydney’s face. “I like it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s an alpha test?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Every mission has a team leader, called an <i class="calibre8">alpha</i>, who
                        comes up with the plan and runs the operation,” he explained. “To prepare for that, we run alpha
                        tests as practice.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre17">“Except, I haven’t had any training,” Sara replied. “I
                        don’t
                        know how to plan a mission.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t sell yourself short,” Sydney said firmly. “You already have the intel.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave her a confused look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The intelligence,” Sydney explained. “You know the inner workings of the
                        house.
                        All you have to do is break down the variables and devise a scheme. For example, who’s inside
                        right
                        now?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara checked her watch. “It should just be the Clarks,” she said. “The kids are
                        all
                        either at day care or after-school programs for another forty-five minutes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent, so we only have two people to deal with,” said Mother. “Where’s the
                        shoebox?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On the top shelf of my bedroom closet … which is on the third floor.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s not ideal,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And the only way to get there is to go through the living room, where I’m sure
                        Leonard is sitting in his recliner watching television and drinking a beer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Also less than ideal,” he said. “But it’s still clear-cut. You just need some
                        sort
                        of bait that will get them out of the way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s called the nugget,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The nugget?” Sara asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Something to distract them,” answered Sydney. “To lure them from the living
                        room.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do they find … <i class="calibre8">irresistible</i>?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Beer … pizza&nbsp; …” Sara continued thinking as she studied the house. For
                        her it
                        was filled with memories of sadness and disappointment. She looked up at the roof where she and
                        Gabriel had been locked out for an entire night. And that’s when the brainstorm hit. “… and
                        money!”
                        she said. “They love money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I don’t think we have enough cash for a bribe,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s okay,” Sara replied. “Just the idea of money should be enough to get
                        them.
                        Can you pass yourself off as an FBI agent?” “I’d need a wardrobe change,” Mother said. He opened
                        his
                        briefcase and pulled out a black tie, which he swapped with the stylish patterned one he was
                        wearing. Then he took out his pocket square and put on a pair of dark sunglasses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wardrobe change complete,” he said. “What’s the plan?”</p>

                    <h2><strong>4. </strong>The Alpha Test</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Perhaps because of their own dishonesty and
                            criminal inclinations, Leonard and Deborah Clark viewed the United States government with
                            deep-seated paranoia. Leonard was always on the lookout for the “surveillance drones” he
                            claimed flew nightly missions over Brooklyn. “They’re spying on us,” he’d say angrily. “Our
                            own government is spying on us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It was this suspicion, combined with the Clarks’ unbridled greed, that formed
                        the basis of Sara’s plan. She needed them out of the way long enough to slip up to her old room
                        and come back down without being noticed. To do that, Mother had to lure them away with what he
                        and Sydney had called the nugget.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo driver parked around the corner, and the girls hid across the street
                        behind a car, while Mother went up the stoop and rang the bell. As he always did, Leonard Clark
                        peered through a side window to see who was there. After eyeing Mother suspiciously, he cracked
                        the door slightly open and said, “What?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are you Leonard Clark?” Mother asked, using a Texas drawl and doing his best
                        to project FBI cool and calm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who wants to know?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Federal Bureau of Investigation.” Mother flashed an official-looking
                        badge. “I’m Special Agent Marlborough of the cybercrimes division.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Leonard shifted uneasily but said nothing.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-36" class="calibre17">“I’m here because of your daughter,” Mother continued.
                        “Sara Martinez.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That girl’s not my daughter,” Clark replied, wagging an angry finger. “She’s a
                        criminal who belongs in jail.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Be that as it may,” said Mother, “it has come to our attention that she
                        recently hacked into a bank and made a substantial withdrawal.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Clark’s eyes opened wide. “Did she take money out of my account? Because if she
                        did …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, sir,” Mother replied. “The money was procured from the bank’s currency
                        reserves. We have reason to believe she hid the cash here on the premises.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Suddenly the mention of cash hidden in his home put a smile on Clark’s face.
                        “How much are we talking?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not at liberty to share that information,” responded Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But you said it was ‘a substantial withdrawal.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Please, sir. If I could just come in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Leonard began to formulate a strategy fueled entirely by greed. “Why do you
                        want to come into my house?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Obviously, I need to retrieve the money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You got a search warrant?” asked Leonard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, sir, I don’t,” Mother replied. “But I don’t actually need to search your
                        property. I just need access to your roof.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So that’s where she hid it,” said Clark. “Up on the roof. Clever girl.
                        Devious, but clever.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Please, sir,” said Mother. “It will only take a moment.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sorry, buddy. No warrant, no entry. I know my rights.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother played the part beautifully as he feigned frustration and pretended to
                        call a superior. “The homeowner is noncompliant,” he said into his phone. “Activate drone
                        retrieval.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre17">“What?!” bellowed Clark. “You’re not coming at my house
                        with them drones.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ve given me no alternative,” said Mother. “They should be here any
                        minute.” He looked to the sky as if waiting for a squadron of drones to swoop into action.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Clark slammed the door shut, and Mother heard the sound of the bolt locking. He
                        leaned over to the side window and pleaded, “Perhaps we can work out some sort of finder’s fee
                        for you and your wife.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Leonard flashed a grin and yanked the curtains closed. Mother waited a moment
                        before motioning the girls over from their hiding place.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How’d it go?” Sara asked as she dug in her pocket for her house key.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just like you said it would,” answered Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She pressed her ear up to the window and listened until she heard the sound of
                        the door to the roof slam shut.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They’re on the roof,” she said. “They’ll tear it apart looking for that
                        money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She unlocked the door and quietly raced up the stairs to the third floor with
                        Sydney following close behind. They entered a room where three beds had been fit together like a
                        jigsaw puzzle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Look at that,” Sara said, pointing at a bare mattress and empty nightstand.
                        “They’ve already gotten rid of my stuff.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Think they tossed your shoebox?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No way,” she said. “I hid it too well.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara stood on her tiptoes so she could reach the top shelf of the closet and
                        groped around until she felt what she was looking for.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Got it,” she said as she carefully pulled down a pale blue box, its color
                        faded with age. She held it tightly, making sure not to spill its contents. “Let’s get out of
                        here.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-38" class="calibre17">Back in the hall they heard the commotion on the roof as
                        the Clarks frantically searched for the nonexistent money. The plan had worked perfectly, and
                        she and Sydney had an easy getaway …until Sara froze.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She stood motionless and thought about the cruelty she’d witnessed from the
                        Clarks. She looked at the closet where they’d locked Gabriel and thought about how scared he’d
                        been that night on the roof.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hurry up,” said Sydney. “We’ve got what we came for.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked at Sydney for a moment and then at the door to the roof, her anger
                        building as she remembered the sound of Gabriel’s sobbing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sara!” Sydney said urgently. “Believe me when I say we don’t want them to
                        catch us in this house. It could ruin everything.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara ignored her and went up the final flight to the roof access.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What are you doing?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Letting them know how it feels.” Sara reached for the door and turned the
                        lock, trapping them on the roof. “That’s for Gabriel.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sydney sighed. “Okay, I like that. But can we go now?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You bet we can,” Sara said. “I don’t ever want to see this dump again.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They rushed down the stairs and burst out the front door. Just as they reached
                        the sidewalk, they could hear Deborah Clark call to her husband.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The door, Lenny! It’s locked!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo pulled up, stopping just long enough for them to hop in. They were
                        still laughing as they pulled away down the street.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I missed something,” Mother said, looking at the two of them. “What’s so
                        funny?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I locked them on the roof,” Sara said, satisfied. “Just like they did to
                        Gabriel and me.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre17">“That wasn’t part of the plan,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” she countered. “But you said I was the alpha.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you said that the alpha is in charge of the mission once it’s
                        operational.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Also true,” he admitted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So, I made it part of the plan,” she said defiantly. “Did I pass the test? Am
                        I three for three?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” answered Mother. “You passed. And, while I see the appeal of locking
                        them on the roof, it probably wasn’t the best thing to do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Life is filled with ‘probabilities,’ ” she said, repeating his line</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">back to him. “I guess we’re both going to have to get used to them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">A smile slowly formed on his face, and he chuckled.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m wondering what I’ve gotten us into,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara grinned. She spun around in her seat and looked back toward the house as
                        it disappeared in the distance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They’ll be stuck up there until the kids get home,” she said. “I wonder what
                        they’ll tell them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nothing,” replied Mother. “The kids aren’t coming home.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">A panicked Sara turned back to face him and asked, “Why not?</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">What happened to them?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Everything’s fine,” he assured her. “At MI6 we have friends in American law
                        enforcement. We passed along the files you hacked as well as some others we found and asked them
                        to dig a bit deeper. Right now, a senior social worker is meeting with the children and seeing
                        to it that all of them are assigned to better homes. Meanwhile, the New York Office of Children
                        and Family Services is taking
                        a closer look at the Clarks and their history as foster parents. The roof is only the beginning
                        of their
                        problems.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara was stunned. “You did that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, Sara, you did,” he said. “I just made a few phone calls. You did the
                        difficult work. I know you’re not familiar with it, but this is what justice feels like. This is
                        what we’re all about.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As Sara considered this, she reflexively hugged the shoebox against her chest.
                        Her defiant attitude melted away and tears</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">began to stream down her face. She didn’t try to stop them. For the first time
                        in her life she didn’t mind someone seeing her cry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The others were quiet for a moment until Sydney placed a gentle hand on her
                        knee. “Are you okay?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara wiped away some of the tears and nodded. “Better than okay,” she said. “I
                        just don’t understand how all of this happened. This morning I woke up in jail, and now I’m
                        about to fly to Scotland for spy training. It’s just so … overwhelming.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know exactly what you mean,” said Sydney. “I felt the same way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a lot to take in,” said Mother. “I’m sure you have some questions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Only a few thousand,” joked Sara. “I don’t even know where to start.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How about we start at the beginning?” He looked down at the scars on his hand.
                        “Why don’t I tell you about the fire?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo glided into traffic heading toward JFK Airport.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Five years ago, I went to Paris on a top-secret mission called Operation
                        Gumdrop.…”</p>

                    <h2><strong>5. </strong>Operation Gumdrop</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre8">Paris, France&mdash;Five Years Earlier</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Despite its playful name, Operation</span> Gumdrop was
                        deadly serious. Mother had spent more than a year trying to infiltrate Umbra, a global crime
                        syndicate made up of mercenaries, terrorists, and former intelligence agents. Its leader was a
                        shadowy figure known simply as <i class="calibre8">Le Fantôme</i>, which was
                        French for “the Ghost.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Little was known about him, although it was believed that, in addition to being
                        a master criminal, he was also an avid art collector. This was why Mother went to Paris posing
                        as a black-market dealer with three priceless Monets. MI6 didn’t think Le Fantôme would trust an
                        underling to judge whether they were forgeries. If Mother could arrange a face-to-face meeting,
                        he might be able to arrest him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">A key to this plan was setting up shop in an abandoned factory on the outskirts
                        of the city. The factory had once manufactured candy, which was how Operation Gumdrop got its
                        name.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother looked at the building through a rusted chain-link fence. Its royal-blue
                        walls were dull and peeling. Broken windows lined the second floor, and the parking lot was
                        overrun with weeds and wildflowers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Beautiful,” he said, taking it all in. “Absolutely beautiful.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">With bolt cutters for the chain on the fence and a lockpick for the main door,
                        he was inside in less than ninety seconds. Skeletal remains of
                        old machinery filled the factory floor and reminded him of the dinosaur exhibits at the Museum
                        of Natural
                        History. A wall was lined with giant sacks of sugar long since devoured by rats.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This was where he planned to set his trap. Just as rodents had been lured into
                        the building by the sweet scent of sugar, Mother hoped Le Fantôme would be unable to resist the
                        temptation of three stolen Monets, which were in fact masterful forgeries confiscated by
                        Scotland Yard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">On the second floor Mother found a row of offices that had once housed <i
                            class="calibre8">Confiserie Royale S.A.</i>&mdash;or the Royal
                        Candy Corporation&mdash;a grandiose name for a company that manufactured low-quality gummies and
                        lollipops. He looked in each office and found nothing of interest until he reached the final
                        one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As the beam from his flashlight swept the floor, he spied a blanket and pillow
                        laid out like a bed. Next to them a row of books was neatly lined against the wall. He squatted
                        down and ran his finger along their spines. Some titles were in English and others in French. He
                        smiled when he noticed they’d been alphabetized by author.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He turned on a reading lamp by the pillow, and amber light filled a corner of
                        the room. That’s when he heard the rustling behind him. He spun around, rising to his feet,
                        expecting to confront either an attacker or a rodent, but instead saw only a boy cowering behind
                        an overturned desk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother exhaled deeply and, once his pulse calmed, said, <i
                            class="calibre8">“Bonjour.”</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy did not respond.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">“Je ne suis pas la police,”</i> Mother told him. “I’m not
                        the police.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He carefully placed the flashlight on the floor and held up empty hands to show
                        that he meant no harm. The boy responded by cautiously
                        moving out from behind the desk, keeping his back to the wall and his eyes fixed on the man. He
                        looked to be
                        about ten or eleven years old and wore several layers of clothes to fight the winter cold. He
                        had dark skin and cropped hair, and he looked like he was ready to bolt for the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Please don’t run,” said Mother. “You speak English, right?” He motioned to the
                        books on the floor. “I say that because some of the books are in English and my French is not
                        very good.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy did not answer but nodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not going to hurt you,” Mother promised. “Is this your home?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Another nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do you live here with the rest of your family?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy spoke for the first time. “No family.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother noticed a dingy yellow electrical cord leading to a larger lamp in the
                        corner of the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m just going to reach over and turn this on,” he said, slowly moving toward
                        the lamp, careful not to scare the boy away. “So we can see better. Is that okay?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This illuminated the entire room, and now Mother saw that, in addition to the
                        makeshift bed and books, there was a drawer on the floor holding several items of neatly folded
                        clothing. There was also a chess set with the pieces arranged in the middle of a game.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who are you playing?” he asked, worried another, possibly larger, person might
                        be hiding nearby.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I play myself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother was both relieved and saddened. His first instinct was that the boy’s
                        accent was from Central Africa. That would mean he was far from
                        home and completely alone. He examined the progress of the match and said, “You’re good.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do you play?” asked the boy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Want to play me?” This was accompanied by a hopeful grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I wish I had the time,” said Mother. “But unfortunately, I don’t.” His mind
                        raced as he tried to solve this unexpected wrinkle in his plan. “You live here alone?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But the fence was locked. How’d you get in?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I have a secret way,” said the boy. “So no one can follow me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Where is it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy smiled. “If I told you, it would not be a secret.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Fair enough,” Mother conceded. “Can you tell me your name?</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Or is that a secret too?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They call me <i class="calibre8">Le Roi du Paris</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">At first he thought the boy had said “Leroy,” as in the name, but then he
                        remembered that in French “<i class="calibre8">le roi</i>” meant “the
                        king.” He chuckled. “You’re the king of Paris?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They call me that to make fun of me, but I do not care.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, I’m not going to make fun of you,” said Mother. “So which would you
                        rather I call you? Leroy or Paris?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy shrugged. “Paris, I think.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay, Paris, I’d like to make a business arrangement with you.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I’d like to rent this building for the next month. I’ll pay a generous rate.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I do not understand.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s hard to explain,” said Mother. “But I need this building …for my work.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I will share it with you,” said Paris. “There is enough room for us both. We
                        can play chess when you are not working.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-45" class="calibre17">“I’m afraid that’s not possible,” he said. “It wouldn’t be
                        safe for you. You need to go someplace else.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">According to MI6 protocol, Mother had three options: cancel the operation, move
                        to a different location, or use intimidation to get rid of Paris. But he’d spent a year getting
                        to this point, the building was perfect for his needs, and he couldn’t bring himself to threaten
                        a child. So, he came up with a fourth option instead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They went shopping.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother bought Paris new clothes and a winter coat. He arranged for him to stay
                        in an MI6 safe house and fed him better than he’d ever been fed. They even squeezed in time for
                        a few games of chess. Part of the arrangement, though, was that Paris was not allowed to come
                        anywhere near the factory.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This was a rule the boy broke every evening just after sunset when he snuck
                        back to spy on his new friend. Paris watched one night as Mother unloaded wooden crates from the
                        back of a moving truck. Another time, he saw him installing hidden surveillance cameras. He
                        couldn’t imagine what the Englishman was planning, but his curiosity was piqued.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris didn’t see anyone else there for three weeks, until he arrived one night
                        to find two black Mercedes parked in front of the factory. A light snow had fallen, and one
                        car’s engine was idling. He assumed someone was inside using the heater, although the tinted
                        windows made it impossible to tell.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He crept closer and hid behind an abandoned delivery truck. When he heard
                        people coming out of the building, he crawled under the truck to spy on them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The group consisted of a woman and three men, with no sign of Mother. One man
                        had a gun and constantly scanned the road, looking for possible threats. The other two carried
                        narrow wooden boxes, which they loaded into one of the trunks.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-46" class="calibre17">A fourth man got out of the car and began an angry
                        conversation with the others. He was bald with a gray-black beard and wire-framed glasses. Paris
                        couldn’t make out the language they spoke, so he crawled closer to hear better. He must have
                        made a noise because two of the men instantly looked his way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris pressed his body against the cold, hard ground and said a silent prayer,
                        hoping they didn’t see him. He tried not to move a muscle, but a moment later he heard a bang
                        and the sound of glass exploding. He assumed the guard with the gun had shot at the truck and
                        broken its windshield, but when he opened his eyes, everyone was looking up at the building.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There was more exploding glass, and Paris inched forward so he could look up
                        from beneath the truck. That’s when he saw the fire burning inside the factory. The sound had
                        been a second-floor window shattering due to the heat. He waited for the people to react, but
                        they just stood there watching the building burn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">In the same room where he first discovered Paris, Mother was about to die. His
                        hands were tied behind his back, his feet were wrapped together with wire, and a rag had been
                        forced into his mouth so he couldn’t scream for help. He writhed on the floor, trying to break
                        free, his face covered in sweat from the heat of the >nearby flames. He strained with all his
                        might, but there was nothing he could do to loosen the bindings. Each breath filled his lungs
                        with smoke and brought him closer to death.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He closed his eyes and did his best to accept that this was where his life
                        would come to an end. He tried to figure out where he’d gone wrong. How he’d wound up in this
                        situation. But mostly he thought
                        about the woman who Paris had seen outside the building.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It was Mother’s wife, Clementine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She was also an MI6 agent, yet she’d betrayed him and their country to join
                        forces with Umbra. How could she have done that? How could the woman he loved leave him to die
                        in a fire?</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pushed those questions away and instead thought about their two children. He
                        wanted their faces to be the last pictures in his mind. He heard the crackling of the wooden
                        floor as the fire closed in on him, but just as he started to fade away, the gag was yanked from
                        his mouth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother hacked out smoke and opened his eyes, expecting to see his wife. But she
                        wasn’t his rescuer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It was Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Get out of here,” Mother said, coughing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Quiet,” replied the boy. “They are still outside. Do not let them hear you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The flames dancing along the wall cast eerie shadows on Paris’s face as he
                        struggled to free Mother’s wrists.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You need to save yourself,” Mother insisted. “Even if you can untie me, we
                        can’t escape without them seeing us. They’ll hurt you, too.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Finally the knot loosened and came undone. Paris smiled at Mother and said,
                        “Maybe now I will show you my secret way out of the building.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>6. </strong>The Welcoming Committee</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre8">Edinburgh, Scotland&mdash;Present Day</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">The sounds of morning commuters</span> echoed through
                        Waverley station, interrupted every minute or so by a woman announcing arrivals and departures
                        over the public address system. Paris had just gotten off the train from Aberdeen and was in a
                        hurry as he expertly navigated the jumble of passengers and luggage trolleys that filled
                        platform twelve.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It had been five years since he’d saved Mother from the fire, and during that
                        time he’d grown seven inches and added fifty pounds. But his physical transformation was nothing
                        compared to the other changes in his life. The Rwandan refugee who lived >alone in an abandoned
                        factory was now part of a family in which he played the role of protective older brother. He’d
                        flourished in his new environment, adapting in every way except one: No matter how hard he
                        tried, he simply could not get used to the weather.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Looking up through the glass-paneled roof, he saw the sky was nothing more than
                        a dismal swirl of black and gray with no hint the sun even existed. “Another lovely day in
                        Scotland,” he muttered as he flipped up the collar of his overcoat and braced for the cool, damp
                        air that would greet them outside the station. “Hurry up,” he said, turning to the others.
                        “We’re on a schedule.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So’s my stomach,” replied Rio, who’d stopped in front of a takeaway stall with
                        a display case full of pasties. They’d skipped school in order to be at the airport when Sara
                        arrived. And while Rio didn’t mind missing class, he definitely minded missing lunch. “Just give
                        me a minute,” he said as he checked his wallet. “And spot me a fiver.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No and no,” Paris answered. “We don’t have a minute, and you already owe me
                        twenty quid.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio made an exasperated gesture toward Kat, who stood next to him eating an egg
                        sandwich. “How come she has time to eat and I don’t?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because this morning, she got up early and packed a lunch,” answered Paris.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Once I checked the train timetables and factored in how long it would take to
                        get to the airport, I knew I wouldn’t get a chance to eat otherwise,” she said before taking
                        another bite.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s called planning ahead,” Paris said. “You might try it sometime.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio pointed to the other half-sandwich she was carrying, its delicious goodness
                        wrapped in neatly creased wax paper. “I don’t suppose you factored sharing into your equation.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat tried not to laugh too hard with her mouth full.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’ll be food at the airport,” Paris promised as he headed up the exit
                        ramp. “But right now we’ve got to move. If we’re not there before they land, this whole trip
                        will be a waste.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The three of them were serving as Sara’s welcoming party, but with a twist.
                        They weren’t actually going to greet her so much as they were going to spy on her. After all,
                        they worked for MI6. Spying was their specialty. They wouldn’t officially meet her until later
                        at the house. But introductions like those were awkward, making it hard to get a good read on
                        someone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They were just weeks away from an important mission, and if she was going to be
                        part of their team, they wanted their first impressions to be unfiltered. So rather than
                        bringing balloons and a banner that read <span class="calibre7">WELCOME TO THE UK</span>, they
                        headed for the airport with surveillance equipment and hidden transmitters ready for
                        reconnaissance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I hope she’s nice,” Paris said as they exited onto Waverley Bridge. “And plays
                        chess. I’m tired of beating you lot.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I just want her to stay out of my room,” said Kat. “I don’t like it when
                        people touch my things.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really?” Rio said. “We never would have guessed that from the padlock on your
                        door or that expression you make whenever someone stands close to you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She shot him a dirty look, and he laughed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just stating facts,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Besides, it doesn’t make sense to add someone right now,” Kat continued.
                        “There’s not enough time to prepare.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, it makes sense to Mother,” said Paris. “And that’s all that matters.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They boarded a sky-blue double-decker bus that ran from the train station to
                        the airport, and found the top deck empty. The privacy allowed them to continue their “spy talk”
                        as they sat sideways across the back three rows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What about you?” Paris asked Rio. “What do you hope she’s like?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m with Kat,” he said. “I don’t think we should add anyone so close to a
                        mission. But, if we’re going to do it, I just hope she’s younger than me. I’m tired of being the
                        youngest.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why?” asked Kat. “What’s bad about that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He gave her an incredulous look. “Every. Single. Thing. I get leftovers. I get
                        hand-me-downs. And most of the time, I get overlooked.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris scoffed. “That’s rubbish.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre17">“Is it?” asked Rio. “Take today, for example. Why are you
                        the alpha?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because I’m the …” Paris thought about the right phrasing before saying, “…
                        most experienced.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s just another way of saying ‘oldest,’ ” said Rio. “Coming here was my
                        idea, but I bet you never considered letting me plan it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I would’ve,” he said defensively. “But it’s a tricky mission.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This isn’t a mission,” Rio protested. “A mission’s nicking files from the
                        Russian embassy without getting caught. Which we both did even though you got most of the
                        credit. This is … <i class="calibre8">sightseeing</i>. We’re just going to follow a girl.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hey,” Kat said, offended.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not saying it because she’s a girl,” he responded. “I’m saying it because
                        she hasn’t had any training. We’re not even going to come into contact with her. It’s
                        easy-peasy. But you still wouldn’t let me be the alpha. And it’s too bad, because I’d ace it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio liked to joke, but Paris could tell this was different. This was something
                        that had been building up inside him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I even solved the problem,” Rio added.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What problem?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The one you haven’t mentioned because you don’t know what to do about it,” he
                        answered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris waited for more, but Rio didn’t elaborate. “All right,</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">enlighten me. What problem haven’t I solved?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio shook his head. “It doesn’t matter what I think. I’m not the alpha. I’m
                        just a helper. I’ll do what I’m told and keep my mouth shut. Even when this whole thing goes
                        pear-shaped.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris turned to Kat, who rolled her eyes and nodded her approval.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” said Paris. “<i class="calibre8">You</i> can be the alpha.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-52" class="calibre17">“Really?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m handing you the reins, mate. Now, what’s the problem?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This bus,” Rio said, eager to share his thinking. “When she exits the airport,
                        she’s either going to take the bus or the tram into the city.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s the problem with that?” asked Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Following her means we need to get on board,” he said. “That’s fine on the
                        tram because there’re seven cars. But if she rides the bus, she’ll likely see us. And then
                        she’ll recognize us tonight at dinner.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris nodded. “You’re right. I <i class="calibre8">was</i> worried about that.
                        What’s your solution?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Three positions,” Rio said. “First, a lookout right outside International
                        Arrivals. The lookout identifies Sara and describes her to the others. Second, someone in the
                        terminal to see if she takes the bus or the tram.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And third?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Already waiting back in the city,” Rio said with a sly grin. “No matter which
                        way she goes, the third person has time to get to the bus stop or the tram station and follow
                        her from there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s clever,” said Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio grinned and kept going. “The key position is going to be the lookout.
                        Mother always makes us split up as soon as we get through passport control. That means she’ll be
                        by herself when she comes through the door. The lookout has to pick her out of the crowd.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Got it,” said Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio stopped and looked at her. “What do you mean, <i class="calibre8">got
                            it</i>?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I mean I’ll have no problem spotting her,” she said, as if it were obvious.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What makes you think you’re the lookout?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-53" class="calibre17">“Common sense, past experience,” she replied. “The fact
                        that I’m better at it than either of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris went to protest, but Kat held up a hand to stop him. “Just stating
                        facts.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, I’m sorry you feel that way, but you’re wrong,” replied Rio. “It’s the
                        hardest job. It’s the most important job. And since I’m the alpha, I’m the lookout.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But I’m …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No buts,” Rio said, cutting her off. “There’s no way I’m changing my mind.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll give you the other half of my sandwich,” she said, holding it up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Deal,” he said without hesitation as he snatched it from her hand. “Kat’s the
                        lookout.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Oh, you’re some alpha,” said Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You bet I am,” Rio said as he unwrapped the sandwich and took a huge bite. “I
                        was always going to make Kat the lookout. I was just hungry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s okay,” she replied. “I was always going to give you the sandwich.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Where do I fit in this plan?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re in the terminal,” Rio said with a swallow. “I’m going to ride back to
                        the city center and wait for her there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris smiled. “Which gives you just enough time to run back to the pasty shop
                        and get a pie.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Traditional Cornish steak with beef, potatoes, and onions in a golden-brown
                        crust,” Rio replied, savoring the thought of it. “Like I said, it’s the perfect plan. At least
                        it is if you spot me the five quid.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The bus reached the airport, and the passengers started to get off. Paris
                        reluctantly handed Rio a five-pound note and said, “That makes twenty-five you owe me now.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-54" class="calibre17">“I know,” he said. “I’m good for it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay, is that everything?” Kat asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” answered Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then say it,” she told him. “It’s the alpha’s job, and we can’t start without
                        it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio grinned from ear to ear. “This operation is hot. We are a go.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>7. </strong>Chaos Theory</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Mother liked to make up</span> little sayings, called
                        Motherisms, to help his team remember key principles of spycraft. One of his favorites was <i
                            class="calibre8">You can’t look out if you stand out</i>. This was a reminder that an
                        essential element of surveillance was disappearing into the background.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat often found this challenging in Scotland, where it seemed like everyone was
                        fair-skinned. She was Nepali and had a dark complexion that most people mistook for Indian or
                        Pakistani but was impossible to confuse with Scottish. Luckily, with travelers from around the
                        world, the airport gave her plenty of places to blend in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She found a perfect spot in the coffee shop near customs and immigration.
                        Rather than solid walls, it had angled wooden slats designed to let in plenty of light. This
                        gave her an ideal vantage point where she could hide from view but still see everyone passing
                        through the International Arrivals gate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat was an excellent lookout because she saw the world differently. The complex
                        math that continuously ran through her head tended to make her socially awkward, but also let
                        her identify patterns where everyone else saw chaos.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I still don’t understand how you do it,” said Rio, talking to her >through the
                        tiny earpiece she was wearing. “What’s the trick?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You think everything’s a trick,” she whispered into the microphone hidden in
                        her coat’s lapel. “But it’s not. It’s just maths.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre17">Even though Rio had ridden the bus back to Edinburgh, and
                        Paris was waiting in another part of the terminal, they were able to talk to each other using a
                        custom-made communication app on their phones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How many passengers are on an international flight?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“At least two hundred fifty,” Paris answered, joining in the conversation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And how many have landed in the last half hour?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris checked the arrivals monitor and answered, “Four: Bangkok, Amsterdam,
                        Istanbul, and New York.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That means there are at least one thousand people coming through Passport
                        Control,” said Rio. “How is finding one person out of a thousand not a trick?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Your first mistake is thinking of it as one thousand people,” Kat answered.
                        “It’s easier to calculate as four groups of two hundred fifty. Each group acts as a single unit.
                        They get off the plane together. They get their baggage together. They go through customs
                        together. And you can instantly eliminate three of the groups.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Bangkok, Amsterdam, Istanbul, and New York have different ethnicities and
                        styles of dress,” she explained. “My only concern is the group that’s predominantly American.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That makes sense,” said Paris. “But it still leaves you with two hundred fifty
                        people.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, it leaves me with a single <i class="calibre8">group</i> made up of two
                        hundred fifty people,” she replied. “And one person in that group won’t fit in with the other
                        two hundred forty-nine. That’s your one in a thousand.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre17">“I still don’t get it,” said Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’d love to explain it in more detail,” she replied. “But I just spotted Sara,
                        so we should probably start following her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How confident are you that it’s her?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I didn’t say <i class="calibre8">I think</i> I spotted her,” replied Kat. “I
                        said I spotted her. That means I’m one-hundred-percent confident. She looks about twelve years
                        old. Latina. Brown hair pulled back in a ponytail. Jeans and a blue sweatshirt with white
                        trainers. I’m sending a picture.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat pretended to text someone but actually snapped a photo of Sara and sent it
                        to the others.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How can you be positive it’s her?” pressed Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I could go through the maths again,” she replied. “Or you could just look at
                        the picture and see that she’s carrying Sydney’s purple rucksack.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The key to spotting Sara had been simple. The pattern she didn’t fit was that
                        she was a twelve-year-old girl by herself instead of with her parents. Kat knew to look for that
                        because Mother always insisted they separate in an airport. He said the combination of queues
                        and cameras made it the easiest place for a spy to be photographed and identified.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Between airport security, government surveillance, and tourists taking vacation
                        snaps, you were bound to have your picture taken multiple times. And, with the advances in
                        facial recognition so ware, there was always a danger he could be identified, which is why he
                        didn’t want any of the kids on the team to risk having their picture taken with him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother also saw this as a chance for Sara’s RV test. He gave her detailed
                        instructions to an RV, or rendezvous point, in the city. They were stored in a new mobile phone
                        along with an emergency number in case she got lost. Sara was determined not to use the number.
                        She wanted to ace her tests. Her first instruction was to find the sign marked <span
                            class="calibre7">AIRLINK BUS</span>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Paris, she’s moving toward you,” said Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I got her,” he replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Roger that,” Kat answered as she le the coffee shop and disappeared into the
                        crowd. She needed to make sure Mother and Sydney didn’t spot her when they came through the
                        gate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris stood by a Visit Scotland kiosk trying to blend in with a group of
                        students on a school trip. As Sara walked toward him, he got a good look at her face. He noticed
                        her eyes were darting side to side, trying to take everything in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She looks nervous,” he said to the others.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s understandable,” said Kat. “I was terrified when I</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">arrived.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not me,” Rio said confidently.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really?” Paris retorted. “Because I could’ve sworn that was you crying
                        yourself to sleep the first few nights at the farm.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There was silence on the other end, and Paris felt bad for bringing it up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara checked the directions on her phone right before she passed Paris. He gave
                        her about ten feet before he started following. Once they exited the terminal, he closed the gap
                        enough to eavesdrop on her conversation with the attendant at the Airlink ticket window.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Is this the bus to Waverley Bridge?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” answered the man. “It’s four and a half pounds.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She gave him a confused look. “Four and a half pounds of what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s the price of the fare.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It took a moment, and then Sara flashed an embarrassed smile. “Right. Because
                        here pounds are money and not how much something weighs.” She handed him one of the five-pound
                        notes Mother had given her and boarded the bus.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris chuckled to himself and kept walking. “I can already tell that I like
                        her,” he said to the others. “She just got on the one hundred bus and should be there in twenty
                        minutes, Rio. Kat and I will take the tram and catch up with you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Roger that,” mumbled Rio, his mouth full of Cornish beef pasty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sounds like you’ve already spent my money,” said Paris. “How’s the pie?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Delicious,” Rio answered, contorting his body so no gravy dripped on his
                        shirt. “Absolutely delicious.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The pie was an appropriate reward for what had been a good morning. Not only
                        had Rio stood up for himself but also now his plan was working perfectly. This was the first
                        time he’d been an alpha for anything other than practice. Although Mother wouldn’t know about
                        it, at least Paris and Kat would see what he could do.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">His problem wasn’t just that he was the youngest. He felt like he was
                        overlooked because he wasn’t as good a student as the >others. School was a struggle, and this
                        was a chance to show that his street smarts more than made up for it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He finished the pasty and took a position on Waverley Bridge, which connected
                        the old part of the city and its medieval streets to the new, modern section. He spotted Sara as
                        she got off the bus and walked toward New Town.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve got her,” he told the others. “She’s heading toward Princes Street.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’ll take another fifteen minutes for the tram to get there,”Paris responded.
                        “So you’re on your own until then.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I can handle it,” he answered cockily. “Like I told you, easy-peasy.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-60" class="calibre17">Princes Street was the city’s main shopping avenue. One
                        side was lined with stores and boutiques while the other ran beside a mile-long park that
                        provided postcard-perfect views of Edinburgh Castle. Sara stopped several times to make sure she
                        was following the directions properly, once making a U-turn only to spin around and head back in
                        the original direction a few feet later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s no way she’ll be ready for a mission in three weeks,” Rio said to the
                        others. “She’s totally lost.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a new city,” Paris said, defending her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We go to a lot of new cities and can’t afford to stop and ask directions,” Rio
                        replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He followed her into Jenners, a large department store that filled an entire
                        city block. It had operated out of the same location since 1838, and its three-story atrium was
                        ideal for spy work. Rio would’ve looked out of place following Sara through women’s fashions on
                        the middle level but was able to watch her from the balcony of home furnishings one floor above.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re in Jenners,” he said. “This may be the RV location.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Careful,” said Paris. “Mother and Sydney could be nearby.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, I know that,” answered Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Keep your distance, and make sure they don’t see you,” Paris continued.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know that, too,” Rio replied, exasperated.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re off the tram and headed your way,” said Paris. “As soon as we get there,
                        we can take turns tailing her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio tried to ignore the fact that Paris was giving instructions like he was the
                        alpha. “Roger that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Think it’s the RV?” asked Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t know,” said Rio. “Right now, she’s looking at watches.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Any sign of Mother or Sydney?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre17">“Don’t you think I would’ve mentioned that when Kat asked
                        me if I thought this was the RV?” Rio replied. “Letting me be the alpha means not treating me
                        like I’m a total plank.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sorry, mate,” Paris said. “Old habits.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio watched intently as Sara tried on several watches. The salesperson helping
                        her was distracted when another customer asked a question. When she looked away, Sara slyly slid
                        one of the jewelry boxes off the counter and into her backpack.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio was so stunned, it took him a moment to react. “I don’t believe it!” he
                        exclaimed. “I don’t believe it!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She just nicked a watch.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The salesperson turned her attention back to Sara, who was once again admiring
                        the watch she had on. The woman obviously had no idea that one of the boxes was missing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I mean she nicked a watch,” said Rio. “It was on the counter, and she slipped
                        it into her backpack when the saleswoman looked away.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara handed the watch she was trying on back to the woman and left the counter.
                        Once she was about fifteen feet away, she picked up her pace.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That doesn’t make sense,” said Kat. “Why would she do that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll make sure to ask her,” Rio replied as he tried to keep up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">“But right now she’s doing a runner.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio bumped into a couple looking at living room furniture, and by the time he
                        got around them, Sara had disappeared into the crowd. He sprinted to the stairs and tried to
                        close the gap, but when he reached the ground floor, there was no sign of her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He couldn’t believe it. He took a deep breath before admitting to the others,
                        “She’s gone. I lost her. I <i class="calibre8">am</i> a total plank.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-62" class="calibre17">Moments later Paris and Kat arrived to find Rio standing
                        on his tiptoes looking for Sara among the people on the sidewalk. He was frustrated and
                        embarrassed. He’d blown his first chance as an alpha. The others were more concerned with the
                        idea that Sara was a thief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They crossed the street and sat on a park bench next to the statue of David
                        Livingstone, a famous Scottish explorer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What are we going to do?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio gave him a look. “If we tell Mother, then we have to admit we skipped
                        school and spied on her. He’ll be brassed off.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But we know she’s a thief,” he replied. “We can’t just let her join the team
                        with this mission coming up. How many different ways can that go wrong?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re right,” said Rio. “We’ve got to tell him, even if it means getting in
                        trouble.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>8. </strong>Haystacks</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Mother and Sydney were on the upper level of the
                            Scottish National Gallery admiring a painting of haystacks when Sara came up behind them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Found you,” she said with an easy smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother checked his watch and raised an eyebrow. “You were supposed to <i
                            class="calibre8">find us</i> twelve minutes ago.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She cringed. “Does that mean I failed?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No … you passed … but only just,” he said. “Remember: <i
                            class="calibre8">Bad</i> <i class="calibre8">guys never wait, so good guys can’t be
                            late.</i>”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Catchy,” said Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">Motherisms</i>,” said Sydney. “You get used to them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me guess,” Sara said, pointing at the painting. “You picked haystacks
                        because finding a rendezvous point’s like finding a needle in a haystack?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He laughed. “No, but I wish I had. You’re very clever, Sara.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not everybody likes that about me,” she said sheepishly. “In some of the
                        houses where I’ve lived, being clever was considered a bad thing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Fear not,” he replied. “We’re quite fond of cleverness on the farm. Now let’s
                        get you there so you can see for yourself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara walked toward the exit, but changed direction when she noticed Mother and
                        Sydney going the opposite way. As she hurried to catch up, she asked, “We don’t actually live on
                        a farm, do we?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre17">“That’s just what we call it,” answered Sydney. “You’ll
                        understand when we get there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother led them down a hallway of offices before stopping at an elevator marked
                        <span class="calibre7">STAFF ONLY</span>. He pressed the down button.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Is this another test?” asked Sara. “Because I don’t think we’re supposed to
                        use this elevator.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The door opened with a ding, and Mother and Sydney got in. He turned and asked,
                        “Why not?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because it’s only for employees.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pointed at an ID badge clipped to his belt. “I am an employee.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara couldn’t believe it. She stepped in and asked, “How many fake IDs do you
                        have?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve not counted, but it’s quite a lot,” Mother said with a chuckle. He pushed
                        a button, and the elevator lurched into motion. “Although this one’s legit. I really work here.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara studied his expression. “I don’t know how to tell if you’re joking or
                        not.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not,” he said. “I’m a consultant specializing in art of the
                        late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. You know that Monet painting of the haystacks?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What about it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I helped the museum acquire it last year. I’m quite proud of that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Downstairs they exited the building into a small employee parking lot and
                        headed straight for a sports car that looked like it belonged in a James Bond movie. It was
                        sleek, with tinted windows and a matte black paint job. As she walked toward it, Sara wondered
                        if it came fully loaded with secret weapons and an ejector seat. She was just about to run her
                        fingers along the body when Mother called her.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre17">“Sorry, but that’s not ours,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She turned to see that he and Sydney had stopped at an oldish Volvo station
                        wagon that looked more <i class="calibre8">mom</i> than <i class="calibre8">Bond</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Contrary to what you’ve seen at the cinema, spies have practical cars that
                        don’t attract attention,” he said. “Driving that would spoil the whole secret</i> part of
                        ‘secret agent.’ Besides, we’ve got too many people. We need more seating.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And room for groceries,” added Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent point,” said Mother. “The boys are voracious eaters.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You can have the front seat,” Sydney said, holding open the</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">passenger door. “You’ll get a better view.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Before they drove off, Mother leaned over conspiratorially and whispered,
                        “There is, however, one special feature, if you’d like to press that button.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pointed at a button on the dashboard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really?” Sara said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just make sure everyone’s got their seat belts on.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She clicked her seat belt, checked the others, and then cautiously reached for
                        the button. When she pressed it … the engine started, and Mother let out a cackle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” Sara said, grinning but a bit embarrassed. “You got</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Forget the movies,” he said. “The life of a spy is nothing like 007.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They pulled out of the gravel car park and drove north out of the city.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So in addition to being a spy you’re also a museum consultant,” she said. “Any
                        other jobs I should know about?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m caretaker of a small airfield,” he said. “It’s a little grass runway next
                        to the farm. During World War II it was an RAF base, and now it’s open a few days a week for use
                        by private planes.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre17">“And MI6 is okay with all these side jobs?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They can’t really complain,” he answered. “As far as they’re concerned, I’m
                        dead.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a curious look. “It just gets stranger and stranger with you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you’ve only scratched the surface,” Sydney chimed in from the backseat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Officially speaking, I died in that fire,” Mother explained. “I was
                        double-crossed by our own agents, none of whom know Paris rescued me. So when I contacted my
                        superior and told her what happened, my instructions were to lie low and disappear.Meanwhile,
                        she convinced French police to report that the body of an unidentified man had been found in the
                        factory. Internally at MI6, it was understood that I was that body.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That way any agents passing information to Umbra told their handlers that
                        Mother was no longer a worry,” Sydney added.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The thinking is that a dead agent can accomplish more than a living one,” said
                        Mother. “That’s why they hid me in the middle-of-nowhere Scotland. There are only a handful of
                        people inside the Service who know I’m alive, which means they can’t pay me without attracting
                        attention. The museum and airfield jobs let me earn a salary without anything leading back to
                        MI6.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do you even know anything about the art of the late- nineteenth and
                        early-twentieth centuries?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I have an MA in art history from the University of St.Andrews,” he said
                        proudly. “My cover as an agent was posing as a black-market art dealer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But what if you cross paths with someone from the art world</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">who recognizes you?” asked Sara. “Won’t they find out you’re alive?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre17">“Paris saved me from the fire,” he said. “But I was badly
                        burned and needed surgery. When they operated, they altered my appearance.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How much?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If she were alive today, my own mother wouldn’t recognize me,” he said. “And
                        sometimes I’m still a bit surprised when I look in the mirror and see who’s there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They drove north along the coast through farms and fishing villages like
                        nothing Sara had ever seen. She especially liked looking out at the dark storm clouds forming
                        over the North Sea. Finally, she asked the question that had nagged at her since Mother told her
                        about the fire.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What about your wife?” she asked cautiously. “She was one of the agents who
                        double-crossed you, right?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Clementine,” he answered. “We worked together for fifteen years and were
                        married for twelve. I have no idea how Umbra corrupted her, but they flipped her to their side
                        and she helped set me up.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He said this without emotion, but Sara knew it had to be devastating.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What happened to her?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“After the fire, she disappeared with Annie and Robert.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are they other agents?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No.” He paused for a moment. “They’re my children. Our children, I mean. Mine
                        and Clemmie’s.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You have kids?!” She said it more as an exclamation than a question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” he said. “Annie’s fourteen and Robert’s eleven.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you don’t know where they are?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He shook his head. “No. At MI6, Clementine’s specialty was</p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre8">vanishing</i> assets.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre17">“What’s that?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Say a Russian spy flipped sides and joined forces with the British, she would
                        erase all trace of his previous existence and create an entirely new identity. There’s no one
                        better at scrubbing a trail than Clemmie. She’s certainly done a good job hiding Robert and
                        Annie. I know, because I’ve been looking.” He paused for a moment. “But no one knows her methods
                        better than I do. I will find them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Soon they reached a sign reading <span class="calibre7">WEATHER STATION</span>
                        and <span class="calibre7">AIRFIELD</span>. An arrow pointed them down a dirt road to a squat
                        air traffic control tower next to a grass landing strip. <span class="calibre7">RAF
                            AISLING</span> was painted in faded letters on the side of the tower along with the blue,
                        white, and red roundel that symbolized the Royal Air Force.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This is where you work?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And where I live,” he said. “I’ve got a little flat&mdash;an apartment
                        &mdash;in the tower.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Luckily, our home’s a bit more grand,” Sydney added with a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara laughed too when she saw what Sydney was talking about.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Just beyond the airfield was a sprawling three-story stone house overlooking
                        the sea. It had a turret on one side, and Sara wondered if it might technically be a castle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Curiously, the roof and surrounding yard were filled with scientific equipment.
                        There was a radar tower, wind turbine, antennae, and various other weather instruments. Mother
                        parked the station wagon in front of the house, and Sara noticed a sign that said <span
                            class="calibre7">THE FOUNDATION FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH AND</span> <span
                            class="calibre7">MONITORING</span>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother turned to her and smiled. “Welcome to FARM.”</p>
