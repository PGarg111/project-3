                    <h2>1. <strong>A Man Called Mother</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Sara looked at the water</span> stain on the wall and
                        imagined it was an island. She wasn’t sure if that was because it actually looked like one or
                        just
                        because she so desperately wished she were in some tropical paradise far from Brooklyn and this
                        tiny
                        room on the eighth floor of Kings County Family Court.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She sat across the table from her public defender, a massive man in a rumpled
                        suit
                        named Randall Stubbs. His bulky frame hunched over as he scanned her file. “This doesn’t look
                        good,”
                        he muttered, because stating the obvious was apparently something they taught in law school.
                        “You’re
                        lucky they’ve made such a generous offer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They have?” Sara asked, surprised. “What is it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He looked up from the file and said, “You plead guilty to all charges and get
                        thirty months in juvenile detention.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Two and a half years in juvie didn’t sound generous to Sara, but it probably
                        wasn’t
                        much worse than her last few foster homes. She was tough for a twelve-year-old. She could handle
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And, of course,” he added, “you won’t be allowed near a computer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This, however, was unacceptable.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For how long?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For the duration of your sentence. Maybe longer as a condition of your
                        release.
                        That’ll be up to the judge.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre17">“But all I did was&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” he interrupted. “Hack into the computer network for the entire juvenile
                        justice system of New York City? Is that what you were going to say? Because that’s not what I’d
                        call an ‘all I did’ situation.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know, but I was only trying to …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It doesn’t matter what you were <i class="calibre8">trying</i> to do,” he
                        said.
                        “All that matters is what you did. You’re lucky you’re twelve. If you were thirteen, they
                        probably
                        would’ve bumped you up to a higher court to make an example out of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The weight of this hit her hard, and for the first time she regretted her
                        actions.
                        Not because they were against the law. Legal or not, she had no doubt that she’d done the right
                        thing. But she’d never considered that she could be banished from the one corner of the world
                        that
                        made sense to her. The only time Sara felt at home was when she was sitting at a computer
                        keyboard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll never hack again,” she said. “I promise.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Oh, you promise?” he responded sarcastically. “Maybe you can cross your heart
                        and
                        hope to die once we get in court. I’m sure that’ll fix everything.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara struggled when it came to controlling her temper, a diagnosis confirmed by
                        multiple counselors and at least two school psychologists. Still, she tried to keep cool as she
                        looked at the man who was supposed to be helping her. She couldn’t risk angering him, because he
                        was
                        her only hope for a positive outcome. So she took a deep breath and counted to ten, a tip from
                        one
                        of those counselors whose name she’d long since forgotten.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If I can’t use a computer,” she said, barely masking her desperation, “then I
                        can’t do the one thing I’m good at. The thing that makes me special.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yeah, well, you should’ve thought of that before you&mdash;”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre17">She probably would’ve lost her temper right then and there
                        if
                        the door hadn’t suddenly flown open, and into the room stepped a man who was in every way the
                        opposite of her attorney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He was tall and thin with a thatch of unruly black hair. His suit was
                        impeccable.
                        His tie matched his pocket square. And he spoke with a British accent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sorry to interrupt,” he said politely. “But I believe you’re in my seat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ve got the wrong room,” grumbled Stubbs. “Now, if you don’t mind, I’m
                        having a
                        conference with my client.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Except, according to this Substitution of Counsel form, she’s my client,” the
                        other man replied as he showed Stubbs a piece of paper. This brought an instant smile to Sara’s
                        face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Stubbs eyed the man. “That doesn’t make any sense. She can’t afford a fancy
                        lawyer
                        like you. She doesn’t have any money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Of course she doesn’t have any money. She’s twelve. Twelve-year-olds don’t
                        have
                        money. They have bicycles and rucksacks. This one, however, also happens to have an attorney.
                        This
                        paper says I’ve been retained to represent Ms. Sara Maria Martinez.” He turned to her and
                        smiled.
                        “Is that you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, sir.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brilliant. That means I’m in the right place.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who retained you?” asked the public defender.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“An interested party,” said the man. “Beyond that, it’s not your concern. So if
                        you’ll please leave, Sara and I have much to talk about. We’re due before a judge shortly.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Stubbs mumbled to himself as he shoveled his papers into his briefcase. “I’m
                        going
                        to check this out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a lovely lady named Valerie who can help you,” said the British man.
                        “She’s with the clerk of the court on the seventh floor.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre17">“I know where she is,” Stubbs snapped as he squeezed past
                        the
                        man into the hallway. He started to say something else, but instead just made a frustrated noise
                        and
                        stormed off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Once Stubbs was gone, the new attorney closed the door and sat across from
                        Sara.
                        “I’ve never seen that before,” he marveled. “He literally left the room in a huff.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She had no idea who might have hired an attorney for her, but she was certainly
                        happy with the change. “I’ve never seen it either.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Now tell me,” he said as he popped open the latches of his briefcase. “Is it
                        true?
                        Did you hack into the computers of the city’s juvenile justice system?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She hesitated to answer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You needn’t worry. Attorney-client privilege forbids me from telling anyone
                        what
                        you say in here. I just need to know if it’s true.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She gave a slight nod. “Yes. It’s true.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brilliant,” he said with a wink. He pulled a small computer from his briefcase
                        and
                        handed it to her. “I need you to do it again.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do what again?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hack into the juvenile justice database,” he said. “I need you to make me your
                        attorney of record before Mr. Stubbs gets to the seventh floor and checks for himself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You mean you’re not my attorney?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Never set foot in a law school,” he said conspiratorially. “So chop-chop. I’ve
                        got
                        an associate who’s going to delay him in the hallway, but she’ll only be able to do that for so
                        long.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara’s head was spinning. She didn’t know what to think. “Listen, I don’t know
                        who
                        you are, but the court’s supposed to assign me a lawyer. A <i>real</i> one.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre17">“And the chap with the mustard stain on his tie is the one
                        it
                        assigned,” he replied, shaking his head. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not particularly
                        impressed. Over the last nine years, that same court has assigned you to six foster families and
                        nine schools. It’s been one botch job a er another with them. What do you say we try something
                        new?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She looked at him and then at the computer. She was tempted, but she was also
                        confused. “I don’t think—”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What did he say would happen?” he interrupted. “I bet he’s
                        already worked out a deal with the prosecutor.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Two and a half years in juvie and I’m banned from using a computer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He shook his head. “I can do better than that even without a law degree.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For reasons she didn’t fully understand, Sara believed him. Maybe it was
                        wishful
                        thinking. Maybe it was desperation. Either way, she trusted her gut and started typing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent,” he said. “You probably won’t regret this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">“Probably?”</i> She raised an eyebrow.“Shouldn’t you be
                        trying
                        to build up my confidence?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Only fools and liars speak with certainty about things beyond their control,”
                        he
                        replied. “But I’m optimistic, so I’d rate your chances around … eighty-seven percent.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara smiled and continued typing. “What kind of computer is this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Bespoke,” he answered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I thought I knew all the computer companies, but I’ve never</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">heard of that one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s not a company,” he said. “ ‘Bespoke’ means something has</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">been tailor-made to the specific needs of an individual.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Someone made this for you?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre17">He nodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, whoever ‘bespoke’ it really knew what they were doing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wait until you see the massive one,” he said. “You’re going to love it. That
                        is,
                        if we’re not both behind bars by the end of the day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara knew computers well, but she’d never seen one like this. It was fast and
                        powerful, and she quickly shredded through the firewall that was supposed to protect the
                        juvenile
                        justice portal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They didn’t even fix the backdoor I used the other day,” she said in
                        disbelief.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Large institutions move slowly,” he said. “Hopefully large attorneys do too.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It took her less than two minutes to reach the database for attorney
                        assignments.
                        She happily deleted the entry for Randall Stubbs and asked, “What’s your name?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent question,” he said as he pulled three passports out of his
                        briefcase.
                        “Which sounds best?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He read from the first one. “Croydon St. Vincent Marlborough the Third.” He
                        gave a
                        sour face. “Seems a bit excessive, don’t you think?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded. “Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’ll pass on that.” He read from the next. “Nigel Honeybuns.” This one made
                        him
                        snicker. “Honeybuns? I quite like that.” He tucked it into a pocket in his briefcase. “I think
                        I’ll
                        save that one for another time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re kind of in a hurry,” she reminded him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right, right, here we go,” he said, reading from the last one. “Gerald
                        Anderson.
                        That sounds like a proper barrister. Dull. Boring. Imminently forgettable. Which is exactly what
                        we
                        want. That’s my name, Gerald Anderson.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre17">He handed her the passport so she could check the spelling
                        as
                        she typed it into the database.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I just click ‘update,’ ” she said as she finished, “and we’re all set.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He flashed a nervous smile and paused to listen. “No alarms.” He opened the
                        door
                        and leaned out into the hallway. “No one rushing in to arrest us. Very nice work, Sara.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Except now I have an attorney who’s never gone to law school.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve watched a ton of courtroom dramas on the telly,” he said. “I can handle
                        an
                        appearance before a judge.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t you mean ‘<i class="calibre8">probably</i>’?” she replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He smiled at this. “Right … <i class="calibre8">probably</i>. First, though,
                        I’ll
                        need details about the hack.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m sure they’re all in there,” she said, pointing at the file.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This only tells me what you did,” he replied. “I want to know the reason.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The lawyer, you know, the one who actually went to law school, said it didn’t
                        matter why I did it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It may not matter to him. It might not even matter to the judge. But it
                        matters
                        very much to me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She thought about her answer for a moment, trying to come up with the most
                        straightforward way to tell it. She didn’t want to get upset. She hated showing emotions in
                        front of
                        anyone. “My most recent foster parents …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Leonard and Deborah Clark?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yeah, them,” she said with a sneer. “They like to take in more kids than they
                        have
                        room for because the state pays them by the kid. More kids mean more money, whether they spend
                        it on
                        us or not. No one really checks that. We were crammed into bedrooms that were too small. Rather
                        than
                        give everyone a meal, they put food in the middle of the table, so it looked like there was more
                        than there was. They called it ‘family style,’ which is a joke because they treated us like
                        anything
                        but a family</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A new kid named Gabriel came about a month ago. He was scared. Sad. Lonely.
                        Everything you’d expect from a five-year-old. He liked me because we were the only Hispanic kids
                        in
                        the house.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You spoke Spanish to him?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sometimes,” she said. “Until they made us stop. Mr. Clark told me, ‘You’re in
                        America now, so speaking English is something you’re going to have to get used to.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The lawyer shook his head. “And what did you say to that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I pointed out that Puerto Rico was already part of America, that I’d spent
                        almost
                        my entire life in Brooklyn, and that if <i>he</i></p> really wanted to speak English well, he
                    shouldn’t end sentences with prepositions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The man laughed. “Cheeky.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not exactly sure what ‘cheeky’ means, but his cheeks turned red, so I
                        guess
                        so,” she replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Did you get in trouble?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded, the humor of the moment gone. “I could handle his punishment,
                        though.
                        It was Gabriel who couldn’t.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why was Gabriel punished?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She paused and saw him studying her expression. He wanted to watch her eyes as
                        she
                        spoke.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“One night he wet his bed,” she answered, “and to punish him, they locked him
                        in
                        the hall closet. I could hear him crying. They didn’t care. They would’ve let him cry all night.
                        So,
                        I got up and let him out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And then what happened?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then they locked me in the closet with him. Told me I had to</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">learn my place. So, I picked the lock from the inside and let us both out.” She
                        was
                        on the verge of tears, so she stopped for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And then?” he prodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They locked us outside on the roof. They le us there all night. It was cold.
                        It
                        was terrifying. The next morning, I went to school, got a pass to the computer lab, and started
                        working. First I hacked the juvenile justice database to see how many kids had been sent to the
                        Clarks. Then I hacked their bank accounts to show how much money they were taking in and where
                        they
                        were actually spending it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re not being charged with hacking the bank,” he said, flipping through
                        some
                        pages.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She grinned. “Yeah, they dropped their complaint. I’m pretty sure they don’t
                        want
                        the world to find out that a twelve-year-old girl beat their security system.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nice,” he said. “I might be able to use that later. What’d you do with this
                        information once you’d gotten it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I sent everything to my social worker,” she said. “And you know how stupid I
                        am?
                        When I saw the police coming up to the house, I thought they were going to arrest the two of
                        them.
                        For about forty-five seconds I was happy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But they arrested you instead?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Clarks even had the other kids line up on the porch so they would see me
                        being
                        led out of the house in handcuffs.” She closed her eyes tight, determined not to let a single
                        tear
                        fall. “They said, ‘This is what happens to criminals.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He’d actually heard the story the night before, through a listening device. But
                        he
                        liked hearing stories twice. He wanted to see if they changed. That was always a good indicator
                        of
                        how truthful they were. Besides, seeing her face as she recalled it told him everything he
                        needed to
                        know.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s a good reason,” he said. “I can work with that. I can make this a lot
                        better.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t you mean ‘<i class="calibre8">probably</i>’?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He smiled warmly. “No, I’m certain I can. But I’ll need you to do something
                        difficult. Something the reports in this file say you’re completely incapable of.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s that?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I need you to trust me,” he said. “No matter what I say or do, I need you to
                        trust
                        me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How can I trust you?” she asked. “I don’t even know your name.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sure you do. It’s Nigel Honeybuns. It’s Gerald Anderson. Sometimes it’s even
                        Croydon St. Vincent Marlborough the Third. It all depends on the situation,” he said with a
                        shrug.
                        “But my friends and colleagues, and I do hope that’s a group you’ll soon consider yourself to be
                        a
                        part of, they all call me Mother.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For the first time since she’d been arrested, Sara laughed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Mother? That’s an unusual name for a man.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“True,” he said, smiling at her. “But I’m an unusual man, wouldn’t you say?”
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. <strong>Crunchem Hall</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                    <p> The reports in Sara's file were accurate. She didn’t trust people. Especially adults. To be
                        fair,not
                        many had given her reason to do so. There’d been a few nice teachers along the way. And two
                        good foster families. But that was about it. Now, as she sat in a holding cell waiting to be
                        called
                        into the courtroom, she was having second thoughts about trusting a man who called himself
                        Mother
                        and
                        carried at least three phony passports in his briefcase. </p>
                    <p>"Rich girl, you gonna help me out?"</p>
                    <p>There were only three other girls in the cell, but it took Sara a moment to realize this one was
                        talking to her. She almost laughed at the absurdity of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I'm not rich."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They were sitting on blue wooden benches facing each other, about four feet apart. The older,
                        much
                        larger girl leaned closer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I saw your lawyer,” she said. “Shiny suit. Expensive shoes. You’ve gotta have money to have a
                        lawyer like that. Maybe he can help me out too. Or maybe I can look after you. Keep you safe
                        once we
                        get to juvie. It won’t cost your family much.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Leave her along."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The warning came from an unlikely source, a girl named Emily who’d shared a cell with Sara the
                        night
                        before. Her perfectly manicured nails gave the impression that she knew her way around the salon
                        much better than she did a jail cell. She’d told Sara that she’d been arrested for shoplifting
                        and
                        her mother was making her spend the night behind bars to teach her a lesson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "No one was talking to you, princess," the first girl said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Well, if Sara needs anyone to look after her, I'll do it," Emily replied. "So thanks, but no
                        thanks."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first girl stood and towered over them, her attention now fully focused on Emily. "How do
                        you
                        plan on protecting anybody?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Really, guys,” Sara said, trying to calm the situation. “It’s all a misunderstanding. I don’t
                        have
                        any money. And I don’t need any protection.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emily ignored her and got up in the other girl’s face. “I’ll just use these,” she said, flashing
                        her
                        thumbs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "What? You gonna text someone for help on that phone you shoplifted?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “No,” Emily replied flatly. “I’m going to do this.” With lightning speed, she jabbed her thumbs
                        deep
                        into the sides of the larger girl’s rib cage, making her gasp for air and stagger backward. Sara
                        stared in amazement as Emily reached over and carefully guided the other girl back to the bench,
                        making sure she didn’t fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’ll hurt for a while, maybe bruise a bit, but there’s no real damage,” Emily said in a
                        half-whisper. “I can’t promise I’ll go as easy on you next time, so you might want to think
                        twice
                        before you threaten anyone else.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara sat there amazed and was still trying to make sense of it all when a guard came to the
                        door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Martinez, Sara," he announced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She was too distracted to respond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Martinez, Sara," he repeated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "That's me."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Time for court," he said, unlocking the cell door.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sara looked back at Emily, who said, "Good luck in there."</p>
                    <p>“Thanks,” she replied as she got up and started to leave. She nodded toward the girl who was
                        still
                        catching her breath. “Thanks for that, too.”</p>
                    <p>
                        Emily smiled. "It's what cell sisters do, right?"
                    </p>
                    <p>Sara followed the guard into the courtroom. Her mind was still distracted by what had happened
                        between the two girls as she sat at the defendant’s table next to Mother.</p>
                    <p>"You all right?" he asked when he saw her expression.</p>
                    <p>
                        "Yeah," she said. "I'm fine."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Good, because I need your full attention,” he said. “And I need you to remember the part about
                        trusting me.”</p>
                    <p>She didn’t know what to make of him, but there wasn’t any time to figure it out. The bailiff
                        stood
                        and announced the judge’s entrance.</p>
                    <p>“All rise for the Honorable Lyman J. Pancake. Court is now in session.”</p>
                    <p>Mother smirked. “Pancake? Maybe I should’ve gone with Honeybuns aer all. We would’ve been like a
                        breakfast buffet.”</p>
                    <p>Sara didn’t laugh. She wasn’t in a joking mood.</p>
                    <p>Neither was the Honorable Lyman J. Pancake.</p>
                    <p>He might’ve had a funny name, but the rest of him appeared completely humorless. Perhaps a
                        lifetime
                        of listening to flapjack jokes had worn away his good nature. His expression could best be
                        described
                        as puckered, as if he’d just drunk lemonade without enough sugar. What little hair he had left
                        formed a semicircle of white bristle that started above his ears and met somewhere in the back.
                        After some formalities he asked, “How does the defendant plead?”</p>
                    <p>Mother looked up from his briefcase long enough to announce, “Guilty, Your Honor.”</p>
                    <p>
                        Sara knew she was guilty but thought there’d be some negotiations before they admitted it. From
                        what
                        she’d seen on television, guilty people usually started off claiming to be innocent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The judge turned to the prosecuting attorney and asked, “Is there a plea arrangement, Ms.
                        Adams?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prosecutor was tall and lean with short blond hair. Her youthful face hinted that she’d only
                        been out of law school for a few years, and her huge smile indicated she was delighted, if
                        perhaps a
                        bit surprised, to hear the guilty plea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “No, Your Honor,” she replied. “I had preliminary discussions with Ms. Martinez’s original
                        attorney,
                        but no agreement was reached.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “She looks really happy,” Sara whispered nervously. “I don’t think you were supposed to plead
                        guilty.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Is that true, Mr. Anderson?” asked the judge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather than respond, Mother kept shuffling through his papers. It took Sara a moment to realize
                        that
                        it was because he didn’t recognize his phony name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Is that true, Mr. Anderson?” the judge repeated, this time a bit louder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara nudged him. “<i>You’re</i> Mr. Anderson.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oops,” he whispered to her. “Told you it was forgettable.” He turned his attention to the judge
                        and
                        asked, “Is what true, Your Honor?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That you have not reached a plea arrangement with the prosecution?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s my understanding that opposing counsel has offered a sentence of two and a half years in
                        juvenile detention,” Mother said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That may have been discussed as one of several possibilities,” the prosecutor replied with a
                        Cheshire cat grin. “But like I said, there was no official agreement. And now that there’s an
                        admission of guilt in open court, I’m not inclined to let her off so easy.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara slumped in her chair. Things were going from bad to worse in a hurry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That’s fine,” said Mother. “Because we find that offer unsatisfactory.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I guarantee you won’t get a better one,” she said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I don’t want a better one,” he replied. “I want one that’s worse.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now Sara was really confused.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I’m sorry, what?” asked the judge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Thirty months just isn’t enough,” Mother replied. “My client compromised highly secure computer
                        files. And, although it’s not listed among the charges, she also hacked into the financial
                        records
                        of a multinational bank.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Hey,” protested Sara. “What about attorney-client privilege?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That would only apply if I was actually an attorney,” he whispered. He turned back to the judge
                        and
                        continued, “Your Honor, this behavior is serious and calls for more than two and a half years.
                        Personally, I think she should remain in custody until she turns eighteen.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “What are you doing?” Sara pleaded under her breath. “That’s six years.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “One moment, Your Honor,” he said, raising a finger. “I need to confer with my client.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mother leaned over so that he was right next to Sara’s ear. “As crazy as this sounds, this is
                        the
                        part where I need you to trust me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “But you’re arguing for a harsher penalty than they offered,” she said. “That doesn’t make
                        sense.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It will when I’m done,” he replied. “Just give me ninety seconds.” He unclasped his watch and
                        held
                        it up for her. “Then you can decide.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first time she noticed the back of his left hand was covered with burn scars. They
                        continued
                        up past his wrist and disappeared beneath his sleeve. Somehow, she’d overlooked them earlier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “A fire,” he said, reading her reaction. “I’ll tell you about it when we get out of here. But
                        now
                        I’m asking for a minute and a half of trust.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oddly, the scars were what swayed her. They hinted that there was more to him than fast talk and
                        a
                        nice suit. He’d suffered through something, which meant he was tough. Maybe even as tough as
                        her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She took the watch and examined it. “Looks pretty cheap for someone who’s supposed to be a
                        high-priced attorney.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I keep meaning to get a posh one,” he said. “Maybe we can take care of that once we’re done
                        here.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, she nodded her assent. “Okay … but at ninety-one seconds I start telling the judge
                        about
                        fake passports.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Attagirl.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Your Honor, if I may?” interjected the prosecutor. “We can quickly draft an agreement placing
                        Ms.
                        Martinez in a supervised group home until her eighteenth birthday.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Also unsatisfactory,” said Mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Aren’t you the one who just said she should remain in custody until she becomes an adult?” she
                        asked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Yes, but not at a place like that,” said Mother. “All she’ll do there is learn how to be a
                        better
                        criminal. I have an alternative in mind.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-21" class="calibre17">Sara watched the second hand intently. He was down to a
                        minute
                        and seven seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Where?” asked the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall,” replied Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall?” Pancake asked, trying to place the name.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a specialized facility that houses a handful of juvenile offenders,” he
                        replied. “She’ll get one-on-one attention, counseling, and a first-rate education.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are we placing her in detention or sending her to summer camp?” asked the
                        prosecutor. “The taxpayers aren’t footing the bill for that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“All the fees will be paid by a private foundation,” Mother said, waving a
                        sheet of
                        paper from his briefcase. “I have the documentation right here. Sara Martinez will no longer
                        cost
                        the taxpayers a penny.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara didn’t know what to think when she saw the “documentation.” It was a
                        takeout
                        menu from a nearby deli. According to the watch, he was down to twenty-six seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It sounds too good to be true,” said the judge. “Which undoubtedly means it
                        is. We
                        don’t reward criminal behavior with luxury accommodations. Ms. Martinez broke the law, and she
                        will
                        be going into a supervised group home when we’re done here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Ten seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You might want to rethink that,” said Mother. “She either goes to Crunchem
                        Hall or
                        we change our plea to ‘not guilty’ and move on to a trial that I can guarantee both of you will
                        regret.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why is that?” asked the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother paused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">His time was up, and he looked at Sara. She was torn. She didn’t know where
                        this
                        was going, but it seemed to being going … <i class="calibre8">somewhere</i>. He had a fake name,
                        no
                        legal training, and his key piece of evidence was a list of twenty-seven different sandwiches.
                        He
                        also told lies with alarming ease. Yet, despite all of this, he seemed totally pleased with how
                        events were unfolding. She handed him back the watch, and he smiled.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This is about to get fun,” he whispered to her confidently.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother turned to the judge. “If we go to trial, the first thing I’ll do is
                        insist
                        you remove yourself from the case.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On what grounds?” he protested.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On the grounds that you’re prejudiced against my client because when she
                        hacked
                        the juvenile justice portal, she came across personal e-mails of yours that are embarrassing in
                        nature.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara had no idea what he was talking about. She hadn’t gotten near any e-mails.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The e-mail server wasn’t compromised,” insisted the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then how do I have a copy of this note you sent two weeks ago?” Mother said,
                        and
                        began to read from a piece of paper. “ ‘Yesterday I had dinner with the mayor, and let me tell
                        you
                        that man is an absolute&mdash;’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The judge slammed his gavel repeatedly to keep Mother from reading any further.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why don’t I just put that one down for a second?” Mother said as he laid it on
                        the
                        defense table. “There are also e-mails from various attorneys, such as this one,” he said as he
                        began to read from another. “ ‘How can you take a man seriously when his name is Judge Pancake?
                        Where’d he go to law school? Hash Brown University?’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Objection!” the prosecutor exclaimed as soon as she recognized it as an e-mail
                        she’d written to a friend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He should object, not you,” said Mother. “It’s his name you’re making fun of.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre17">“Your Honor, he’s trying to blackmail us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother laughed. “No, that’s not blackmail. But this next one’s pretty close.”
                        He
                        picked up another paper and started to read. “ ‘About the legal conference last week in Atlantic
                        City, please don’t tell my wife any of …’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Order in the court!” the judge bellowed, pounding his gavel. “Order in the
                        court!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked up at Mother, and he shot her a wink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He turned back to the judge. “There are dozens of such e-mails, and I will make
                        sure that every one is read aloud and placed into the public record, which I can only imagine
                        will
                        be embarrassing for both of you. Or …” He stopped speaking for a moment to give the judge a
                        chance
                        to consider his options.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Tell me more about Crunchem Hall,” said the judge. “Who’s in charge there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Trunchbull,” said Mother. “Very tough.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right, Warden Trunchbull,” the judge said. “Tough … but fair, if I remember
                        correctly. Tell me more.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Four hours later Sara Maria Martinez was released from custody into the care of
                        a
                        man claiming to be Gerald Anderson, attorney-at-law. He signed a few papers, and they exited the
                        courthouse through a revolving door into a sunny Brooklyn afternoon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara took a deep breath of fresh air and asked, “So do you want to explain what
                        happened in there?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We won,” said Mother. “Bit of a drubbing, if I’m being honest.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not so sure we can call that a victory,” she replied. “You got me
                        sentenced to
                        six years in custody.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre17">“True, but they’re to be served at a fictional facility,
                        so it
                        shouldn’t be too difficult.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a look. “What are you talking about?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall is the school in <i class="calibre8">Matilda</i>,” he explained.
                        “Miss Trunchbull is the evil headmistress. They only exist in a children’s book.” He paused for
                        a
                        moment and added, “Unless you count the movie and the musical, both of which I quite enjoyed.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are you insane?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I only had ninety seconds, and I needed to come up with something,” he said.
                        “The
                        trick was using names that were vaguely recognizable. That way they were more likely to think it
                        was
                        real.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But what if they remembered the book?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The prosecutor seemed too young to have kids, and the judge is old enough that
                        it’s been decades since he read any bedtime stories, so I thought we were probably safe.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Again with the ‘probably.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Life is filled with ‘probablies,’ Sara. You’re going to have to get
                        comfortable
                        with them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If it’s a fictional place, then why did you insist on me being sentenced until
                        I
                        was eighteen?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because you’re no longer the concern of the juvenile courts,” he said. “You’ve
                        been sent away until you’re an adult. No one’s going to come looking for you. No social worker’s
                        going to follow up and knock on your door. You’ve fallen through the cracks of the American
                        judicial
                        system.” He smiled proudly. “So cheers for that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re saying I’m free?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In every way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then what happens now?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Now, it gets interesting,” he said. “You’ve got some massive decisions to
                        make.
                        But first I’d like you to come for a ride.” He motioned toward a limousine waiting nearby. “I
                        want
                        to show you something.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In a limo?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I figured you came here handcuffed in the back of a panda car; the least we
                        can do
                        is leave in style.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Panda car?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A police car,” he explained. “It’s black and white, like a panda.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As she followed him, she asked, “So what made you think of <i
                            class="calibre8">Matilda</i>?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It was written by Roald Dahl,” he said. “He’s my favorite author.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You must really like kids’ books.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I do, but that’s not why he’s my favorite,” said Mother. “He’s my favorite
                        because
                        in addition to being a writer, he was a spy.” Mother stopped, turned back to face her, and said,
                        “Just like me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara laughed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not joking,” he said. “I’m an agent with the British Secret Intelligence
                        Service, also known as MI6. That’s why I have the passports. That’s how I have copies of their
                        e-mails. I command an elite team that is only sent out on high-priority missions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And one of those <i class="calibre8">high-priority</i> missions was keeping me
                        out
                        of juvenile detention?” she replied suspiciously.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This wasn’t a mission so much as it was a recruitment. An emergency one, at
                        that.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re about to go into the field for a critical operation,” he said. “And we
                        just
                        discovered that we need one more person on our team. We thought we’d come over and see if that
                        person might be you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-26" class="calibre17">Mother opened the rear door of the limo, and Sara saw a
                        familiar face looking back at her from inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Emily?” she said, recognizing her “cell sister.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Actually, the name’s Sydney,” she replied with an Australian accent. “Glad he
                        was
                        able to bust you out.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>3.</strong> Brooklyn</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Rather than a prisoner transport</span> bus, Sara left
                        the
                        courthouse in a limousine with two people who claimed to be spies. Surprisingly, she had no
                        doubt
                        that that’s exactly what they were. She just wasn’t sure how she fit into their plans.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me get this straight,” she said as they took Atlantic Avenue deeper into
                        Brooklyn. “You two are a team?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Part of one,” answered Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you came here to see if I was a good fit for that team?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s right,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Am I?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So far, it’s quite promising,” he said, “but we can’t be certain until we
                        conduct
                        some more tests.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean, <i class="calibre8">more</i> tests?” she said. “I haven’t
                        taken
                        any.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Actually, you’ve taken two so far,” he answered. “First when I asked you to
                        hack
                        into the juvenile justice portal and make me your attorney. That’s performance under pressure.
                        An
                        essential skill.” He turned to Sydney. “She did it in under two minutes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Impressive,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The second was trusting me in the courtroom,” he continued. “That demonstrated
                        your ability to adapt to rapidly changing situations. Also essential.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I wish I could’ve been there to see it,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s too bad,” joked Mother. “I was sensational.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-28" class="calibre17">Sydney rolled her eyes and shared a look with Sara. “By
                        the
                        way, I did some shopping earlier.” Sydney handed her two department store bags. “I tried to
                        guess
                        your sizes and what you might like.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked in the bags. “You bought me clothes?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just to hold you over until we can get you a proper wardrobe,” she replied.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Although, most days you’ll wear your school uniform,” added Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a curious look. “My school doesn’t have a uniform.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“About that. You’re going to be enrolled in a new school called Kinloch Abbey.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sounds about as fake as Crunchem Hall,” she said. “Let me guess. It’s from <i
                            class="calibre8">James and the Giant Peach</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, this one’s not in a book,” Mother said. “It’s in Scotland.” Sara waited
                        for
                        him to laugh, but he didn’t. She waited some more, but there was still no laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re serious?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a bit posh,” said Sydney. “After all, part of it’s in a castle. But once
                        you
                        get over that, you’ll like it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re going to Scotland?!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Instead of answering, Mother leaned toward the driver and asked, “Can you
                        please
                        turn left and take us to house number 197?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re pressed for time,” Sydney reminded him. “If we miss this flight, we’ll
                        lose
                        an entire day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know, I know,” he reassured her. “It’s just a quick detour for context.
                        Besides,
                        I really want to see it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m sorry,” Sara interrupted, “but can we get back to the whole Scotland
                        thing?”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-29" class="calibre17">“Shortly,” Mother assured her as the limo parked in front
                        of a
                        three-story redbrick town house. “First, tell me what you know about Winston Churchill.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Absolutely nothing,” she said blankly. “The name sounds … kind of familiar,
                        but
                        that’s it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Jaw-dropping,” he said disapprovingly. “Kinloch will take care of that in a
                        tick.
                        But, for now, just know that as prime minister during World War Two, Churchill saved Britain and
                        quite possibly the world from annihilation. He’s a personal hero of mine and did more for the
                        British Secret Intelligence Service than anyone else.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” she said. “So why are you telling me this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because his mother was born in this house.” He gestured out the window. “Think
                        about that. The mother of the man who saved Britain wasn’t from London or Oxford or some grand
                        estate out in Surrey. She was from Brooklyn, just like you. So it follows that we’d come full
                        circle
                        back here to find you. Brooklyn’s imprinted on our DNA.” He turned his attention back to the
                        driver.
                        “Okay,we can move along now.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo started again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s interesting and all,” said Sara. “But it really doesn’t answer my
                        question.
                        Are you seriously taking me to Scotland? Because I don’t even have a passport.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He popped open his briefcase and handed her two British passports, each with
                        her
                        picture and a phony name. “Pick the one you like better.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Of course,” she replied, shaking her head. “You have all the passports you
                        want.
                        How’d you get this picture of me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That bit about us being spies?” he said. “We’re exceptionally good at getting
                        things. As to your first question, yes, we’re taking you to Scotland. Whether you stay there or
                        not,
                        however, will be entirely up to you.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-30" class="calibre17">“How do you mean?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Soon you’ll start classes at Kinloch. It’s one of the top boarding schools in
                        the
                        UK. You’ll get a first-rate education. And if you’re happy there, you can continue until you
                        graduate and leave for university. That’s option one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And if I don’t like it?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Option two,” he answered. “If, at the end of the school year, you decide
                        Kinloch’s
                        not right for you or that you miss living in the States too much, we’ll find you a proper home
                        back
                        here in America. It won’t be like the ones you’ve been stuck in before. We’ll get you a good
                        family.
                        I’ll see to that. Although, we might want to avoid metropolitan New York because of the whole
                        business about them believing that you’re in detention somewhere.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Good point,” she said. “But what does any of that have to do with spies and
                        MI6?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not a thing.” He leaned in conspiratorially and added, “Option three is the
                        one
                        that involves the Secret Intelligence Service.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She looked at both of them before saying, “Then option three is the one I want
                        to
                        hear about.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You attend Kinloch not as a boarder but as a day student,” said Sydney. “And
                        you
                        live at the farm with Monty, me, and the rest of the team.” “Monty?” asked Sara. “Who’s that?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Dr. Alexandra Montgomery,” said Mother. “She’s a
                        biophysicist-slash-cryptologist
                        who loves to bake. Think of her as part Marie Curie and part Mary Poppins.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She’s brilliant,” said Sydney. “You’re going to love her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And the rest of the team?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Kids like you and me who Mother’s found around the globe,” said Sydney.
                        “They’re
                        amazing.” She rethought this for a moment. “I mean, the boys totally drive me bonkers and I
                        usually
                        want to strangle them, but other than that they’re amazing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How many are there?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Two boys and another girl,” she said. “Paris, Rio, and Kat. When you join the
                        team, you have to create an entirely new identity. It’s hard to keep track of all the aliases
                        and
                        fake names, so we just call each other by where we’re from. That way we still have a small
                        connection to our past.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a city called Kat?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Kathmandu,” answered Mother. “It’s in Nepal but that’s rather a mouthful, so
                        we
                        just go with Kat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That means I’d be Brooklyn,” Sara said, liking the sound of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">If</i> you decide to join,” stressed Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What does <i class="calibre8">joining</i> even mean?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It means that in addition to your studies at Kinloch,” he said, “you’ll
                        receive
                        instruction in espionage, counterintelligence, self-defense, code-breaking, and other assorted
                        goodies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“My favorite assorted goody is explosives,” said Sydney. “I like making things
                        go
                        boom.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So we’re talking spy school?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” said Mother. “But not just school. We go on real missions. We face
                        genuine
                        danger.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you said that there’s a mission coming up that you want me to go on,” Sara
                        replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother sighed. “Normally, you receive extensive training before you go into the
                        field, but we’re in a pinch at the moment. There’s an operation in three weeks, and we find
                        ourselves one person down.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And if that person’s me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then I would limit your role as much as possible, but you would have to go
                        into
                        the field with us.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-32" class="calibre17">“Cool,” she said with a grin. “Sounds more fun than
                        juvenile
                        detention.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara would’ve asked more about the upcoming mission, but she was distracted
                        when
                        the limo turned down a familiar street. It was >her neighborhood and just the sight of it made
                        her
                        wince. Everything here was the opposite of boarding schools and castles. There were chain-link
                        fences with razor wire, iron bars on windows, and graffiti covering the wall of an abandoned
                        warehouse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why are we here?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re about to cross an ocean,” he answered. “I thought you might like to stop
                        by
                        home before we left .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This isn’t my <i class="calibre8">home</i>,” she corrected. “It’s a <i
                            class="calibre8">house</i> where I lived. There’s a huge difference.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Duly noted,” he said. “But either way, you won’t be returning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">If there’s anything of sentimental value in there, now’s the time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a shoebox with some things that are special to me,” she said. “But I
                        can’t
                        get it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why not?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Clarks are home,” she said. “Considering I just tried to have them
                        arrested, I
                        doubt they’ll hand it over.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then let’s not tell them,” he replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You want me to break in?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In the spy trade we call it a ‘black bag job,’ ” he said. “We’ll make this
                        your
                        first alpha test.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This brought a smile to Sydney’s face. “I like it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s an alpha test?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Every mission has a team leader, called an <i class="calibre8">alpha</i>, who
                        comes up with the plan and runs the operation,” he explained. “To prepare for that, we run alpha
                        tests as practice.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre17">“Except, I haven’t had any training,” Sara replied. “I
                        don’t
                        know how to plan a mission.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t sell yourself short,” Sydney said firmly. “You already have the intel.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave her a confused look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The intelligence,” Sydney explained. “You know the inner workings of the
                        house.
                        All you have to do is break down the variables and devise a scheme. For example, who’s inside
                        right
                        now?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara checked her watch. “It should just be the Clarks,” she said. “The kids are
                        all
                        either at day care or after-school programs for another forty-five minutes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent, so we only have two people to deal with,” said Mother. “Where’s the
                        shoebox?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On the top shelf of my bedroom closet … which is on the third floor.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s not ideal,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And the only way to get there is to go through the living room, where I’m sure
                        Leonard is sitting in his recliner watching television and drinking a beer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Also less than ideal,” he said. “But it’s still clear-cut. You just need some
                        sort
                        of bait that will get them out of the way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s called the nugget,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The nugget?” Sara asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Something to distract them,” answered Sydney. “To lure them from the living
                        room.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do they find … <i class="calibre8">irresistible</i>?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Beer … pizza&nbsp; …” Sara continued thinking as she studied the house. For
                        her it
                        was filled with memories of sadness and disappointment. She looked up at the roof where she and
                        Gabriel had been locked out for an entire night. And that’s when the brainstorm hit. “… and
                        money!”
                        she said. “They love money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I don’t think we have enough cash for a bribe,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s okay,” Sara replied. “Just the idea of money should be enough to get
                        them.
                        Can you pass yourself off as an FBI agent?” “I’d need a wardrobe change,” Mother said. He opened
                        his
                        briefcase and pulled out a black tie, which he swapped with the stylish patterned one he was
                        wearing. Then he took out his pocket square and put on a pair of dark sunglasses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wardrobe change complete,” he said. “What’s the plan?”</p>
                    </p>
