                    <p>
                       Sara Martinez is a hacker. She recently broke into the New York City foster care system to expose her foster parents as cheats and lawbreakers. However, instead of being hailed as a hero, Sara finds herself facing years in a juvenile detention facility and banned from using computers for the same stretch of time. Enter Mother, a British spy who not only gets Sara released from jail but also offers her a chance to make a home for herself within a secret MI6 agency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Operating out of a base in Scotland, the City Spies are five kids from various parts of the world. When they’re not attending the local boarding school, they’re honing their unique skills, such as sleight of hand, breaking and entering, observation, and explosives. All of these allow them to go places in the world of espionage where adults can’t.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before she knows what she’s doing, Sara is heading to Paris for an international youth summit, hacking into a rival school’s computer to prevent them from winning a million euros, dangling thirty feet off the side of a building, and trying to stop a villain…all while navigating the complex dynamics of her new team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No one said saving the world was easy…

                <article>
                    <h2>1. <strong>A Man Called Mother</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Sara looked at the water</span> stain on the wall and
                        imagined it was an island. She wasn’t sure if that was because it actually looked like one or
                        just
                        because she so desperately wished she were in some tropical paradise far from Brooklyn and this
                        tiny
                        room on the eighth floor of Kings County Family Court.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She sat across the table from her public defender, a massive man in a rumpled
                        suit
                        named Randall Stubbs. His bulky frame hunched over as he scanned her file. “This doesn’t look
                        good,”
                        he muttered, because stating the obvious was apparently something they taught in law school.
                        “You’re
                        lucky they’ve made such a generous offer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They have?” Sara asked, surprised. “What is it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He looked up from the file and said, “You plead guilty to all charges and get
                        thirty months in juvenile detention.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Two and a half years in juvie didn’t sound generous to Sara, but it probably
                        wasn’t
                        much worse than her last few foster homes. She was tough for a twelve-year-old. She could handle
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And, of course,” he added, “you won’t be allowed near a computer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This, however, was unacceptable.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For how long?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For the duration of your sentence. Maybe longer as a condition of your
                        release.
                        That’ll be up to the judge.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre17">“But all I did was&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” he interrupted. “Hack into the computer network for the entire juvenile
                        justice system of New York City? Is that what you were going to say? Because that’s not what I’d
                        call an ‘all I did’ situation.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know, but I was only trying to …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It doesn’t matter what you were <i class="calibre8">trying</i> to do,” he
                        said.
                        “All that matters is what you did. You’re lucky you’re twelve. If you were thirteen, they
                        probably
                        would’ve bumped you up to a higher court to make an example out of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The weight of this hit her hard, and for the first time she regretted her
                        actions.
                        Not because they were against the law. Legal or not, she had no doubt that she’d done the right
                        thing. But she’d never considered that she could be banished from the one corner of the world
                        that
                        made sense to her. The only time Sara felt at home was when she was sitting at a computer
                        keyboard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll never hack again,” she said. “I promise.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Oh, you promise?” he responded sarcastically. “Maybe you can cross your heart
                        and
                        hope to die once we get in court. I’m sure that’ll fix everything.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara struggled when it came to controlling her temper, a diagnosis confirmed by
                        multiple counselors and at least two school psychologists. Still, she tried to keep cool as she
                        looked at the man who was supposed to be helping her. She couldn’t risk angering him, because he
                        was
                        her only hope for a positive outcome. So she took a deep breath and counted to ten, a tip from
                        one
                        of those counselors whose name she’d long since forgotten.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If I can’t use a computer,” she said, barely masking her desperation, “then I
                        can’t do the one thing I’m good at. The thing that makes me special.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yeah, well, you should’ve thought of that before you&mdash;”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre17">She probably would’ve lost her temper right then and there
                        if
                        the door hadn’t suddenly flown open, and into the room stepped a man who was in every way the
                        opposite of her attorney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He was tall and thin with a thatch of unruly black hair. His suit was
                        impeccable.
                        His tie matched his pocket square. And he spoke with a British accent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sorry to interrupt,” he said politely. “But I believe you’re in my seat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ve got the wrong room,” grumbled Stubbs. “Now, if you don’t mind, I’m
                        having a
                        conference with my client.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Except, according to this Substitution of Counsel form, she’s my client,” the
                        other man replied as he showed Stubbs a piece of paper. This brought an instant smile to Sara’s
                        face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Stubbs eyed the man. “That doesn’t make any sense. She can’t afford a fancy
                        lawyer
                        like you. She doesn’t have any money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Of course she doesn’t have any money. She’s twelve. Twelve-year-olds don’t
                        have
                        money. They have bicycles and rucksacks. This one, however, also happens to have an attorney.
                        This
                        paper says I’ve been retained to represent Ms. Sara Maria Martinez.” He turned to her and
                        smiled.
                        “Is that you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, sir.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brilliant. That means I’m in the right place.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who retained you?” asked the public defender.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“An interested party,” said the man. “Beyond that, it’s not your concern. So if
                        you’ll please leave, Sara and I have much to talk about. We’re due before a judge shortly.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Stubbs mumbled to himself as he shoveled his papers into his briefcase. “I’m
                        going
                        to check this out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a lovely lady named Valerie who can help you,” said the British man.
                        “She’s with the clerk of the court on the seventh floor.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre17">“I know where she is,” Stubbs snapped as he squeezed past
                        the
                        man into the hallway. He started to say something else, but instead just made a frustrated noise
                        and
                        stormed off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Once Stubbs was gone, the new attorney closed the door and sat across from
                        Sara.
                        “I’ve never seen that before,” he marveled. “He literally left the room in a huff.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She had no idea who might have hired an attorney for her, but she was certainly
                        happy with the change. “I’ve never seen it either.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Now tell me,” he said as he popped open the latches of his briefcase. “Is it
                        true?
                        Did you hack into the computers of the city’s juvenile justice system?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She hesitated to answer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You needn’t worry. Attorney-client privilege forbids me from telling anyone
                        what
                        you say in here. I just need to know if it’s true.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She gave a slight nod. “Yes. It’s true.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brilliant,” he said with a wink. He pulled a small computer from his briefcase
                        and
                        handed it to her. “I need you to do it again.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do what again?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hack into the juvenile justice database,” he said. “I need you to make me your
                        attorney of record before Mr. Stubbs gets to the seventh floor and checks for himself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You mean you’re not my attorney?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Never set foot in a law school,” he said conspiratorially. “So chop-chop. I’ve
                        got
                        an associate who’s going to delay him in the hallway, but she’ll only be able to do that for so
                        long.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara’s head was spinning. She didn’t know what to think. “Listen, I don’t know
                        who
                        you are, but the court’s supposed to assign me a lawyer. A <i>real</i> one.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre17">“And the chap with the mustard stain on his tie is the one
                        it
                        assigned,” he replied, shaking his head. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not particularly
                        impressed. Over the last nine years, that same court has assigned you to six foster families and
                        nine schools. It’s been one botch job a er another with them. What do you say we try something
                        new?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She looked at him and then at the computer. She was tempted, but she was also
                        confused. “I don’t think—”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What did he say would happen?” he interrupted. “I bet he’s
                        already worked out a deal with the prosecutor.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Two and a half years in juvie and I’m banned from using a computer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He shook his head. “I can do better than that even without a law degree.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For reasons she didn’t fully understand, Sara believed him. Maybe it was
                        wishful
                        thinking. Maybe it was desperation. Either way, she trusted her gut and started typing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent,” he said. “You probably won’t regret this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">“Probably?”</i> She raised an eyebrow.“Shouldn’t you be
                        trying
                        to build up my confidence?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Only fools and liars speak with certainty about things beyond their control,”
                        he
                        replied. “But I’m optimistic, so I’d rate your chances around … eighty-seven percent.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara smiled and continued typing. “What kind of computer is this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Bespoke,” he answered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I thought I knew all the computer companies, but I’ve never</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">heard of that one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s not a company,” he said. “ ‘Bespoke’ means something has</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">been tailor-made to the specific needs of an individual.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Someone made this for you?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre17">He nodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, whoever ‘bespoke’ it really knew what they were doing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wait until you see the massive one,” he said. “You’re going to love it. That
                        is,
                        if we’re not both behind bars by the end of the day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara knew computers well, but she’d never seen one like this. It was fast and
                        powerful, and she quickly shredded through the firewall that was supposed to protect the
                        juvenile
                        justice portal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They didn’t even fix the backdoor I used the other day,” she said in
                        disbelief.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Large institutions move slowly,” he said. “Hopefully large attorneys do too.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It took her less than two minutes to reach the database for attorney
                        assignments.
                        She happily deleted the entry for Randall Stubbs and asked, “What’s your name?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent question,” he said as he pulled three passports out of his
                        briefcase.
                        “Which sounds best?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He read from the first one. “Croydon St. Vincent Marlborough the Third.” He
                        gave a
                        sour face. “Seems a bit excessive, don’t you think?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded. “Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’ll pass on that.” He read from the next. “Nigel Honeybuns.” This one made
                        him
                        snicker. “Honeybuns? I quite like that.” He tucked it into a pocket in his briefcase. “I think
                        I’ll
                        save that one for another time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re kind of in a hurry,” she reminded him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right, right, here we go,” he said, reading from the last one. “Gerald
                        Anderson.
                        That sounds like a proper barrister. Dull. Boring. Imminently forgettable. Which is exactly what
                        we
                        want. That’s my name, Gerald Anderson.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre17">He handed her the passport so she could check the spelling
                        as
                        she typed it into the database.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I just click ‘update,’ ” she said as she finished, “and we’re all set.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He flashed a nervous smile and paused to listen. “No alarms.” He opened the
                        door
                        and leaned out into the hallway. “No one rushing in to arrest us. Very nice work, Sara.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Except now I have an attorney who’s never gone to law school.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve watched a ton of courtroom dramas on the telly,” he said. “I can handle
                        an
                        appearance before a judge.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t you mean ‘<i class="calibre8">probably</i>’?” she replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He smiled at this. “Right … <i class="calibre8">probably</i>. First, though,
                        I’ll
                        need details about the hack.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m sure they’re all in there,” she said, pointing at the file.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This only tells me what you did,” he replied. “I want to know the reason.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The lawyer, you know, the one who actually went to law school, said it didn’t
                        matter why I did it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It may not matter to him. It might not even matter to the judge. But it
                        matters
                        very much to me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She thought about her answer for a moment, trying to come up with the most
                        straightforward way to tell it. She didn’t want to get upset. She hated showing emotions in
                        front of
                        anyone. “My most recent foster parents …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Leonard and Deborah Clark?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yeah, them,” she said with a sneer. “They like to take in more kids than they
                        have
                        room for because the state pays them by the kid. More kids mean more money, whether they spend
                        it on
                        us or not. No one really checks that. We were crammed into bedrooms that were too small. Rather
                        than
                        give everyone a meal, they put food in the middle of the table, so it looked like there was more
                        than there was. They called it ‘family style,’ which is a joke because they treated us like
                        anything
                        but a family</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A new kid named Gabriel came about a month ago. He was scared. Sad. Lonely.
                        Everything you’d expect from a five-year-old. He liked me because we were the only Hispanic kids
                        in
                        the house.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You spoke Spanish to him?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sometimes,” she said. “Until they made us stop. Mr. Clark told me, ‘You’re in
                        America now, so speaking English is something you’re going to have to get used to.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The lawyer shook his head. “And what did you say to that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I pointed out that Puerto Rico was already part of America, that I’d spent
                        almost
                        my entire life in Brooklyn, and that if <i>he</i></p> really wanted to speak English well, he
                    shouldn’t end sentences with prepositions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The man laughed. “Cheeky.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not exactly sure what ‘cheeky’ means, but his cheeks turned red, so I
                        guess
                        so,” she replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Did you get in trouble?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded, the humor of the moment gone. “I could handle his punishment,
                        though.
                        It was Gabriel who couldn’t.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why was Gabriel punished?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She paused and saw him studying her expression. He wanted to watch her eyes as
                        she
                        spoke.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“One night he wet his bed,” she answered, “and to punish him, they locked him
                        in
                        the hall closet. I could hear him crying. They didn’t care. They would’ve let him cry all night.
                        So,
                        I got up and let him out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And then what happened?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then they locked me in the closet with him. Told me I had to</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">learn my place. So, I picked the lock from the inside and let us both out.” She
                        was
                        on the verge of tears, so she stopped for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And then?” he prodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They locked us outside on the roof. They le us there all night. It was cold.
                        It
                        was terrifying. The next morning, I went to school, got a pass to the computer lab, and started
                        working. First I hacked the juvenile justice database to see how many kids had been sent to the
                        Clarks. Then I hacked their bank accounts to show how much money they were taking in and where
                        they
                        were actually spending it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re not being charged with hacking the bank,” he said, flipping through
                        some
                        pages.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She grinned. “Yeah, they dropped their complaint. I’m pretty sure they don’t
                        want
                        the world to find out that a twelve-year-old girl beat their security system.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nice,” he said. “I might be able to use that later. What’d you do with this
                        information once you’d gotten it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I sent everything to my social worker,” she said. “And you know how stupid I
                        am?
                        When I saw the police coming up to the house, I thought they were going to arrest the two of
                        them.
                        For about forty-five seconds I was happy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But they arrested you instead?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She nodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Clarks even had the other kids line up on the porch so they would see me
                        being
                        led out of the house in handcuffs.” She closed her eyes tight, determined not to let a single
                        tear
                        fall. “They said, ‘This is what happens to criminals.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He’d actually heard the story the night before, through a listening device. But
                        he
                        liked hearing stories twice. He wanted to see if they changed. That was always a good indicator
                        of
                        how truthful they were. Besides, seeing her face as she recalled it told him everything he
                        needed to
                        know.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s a good reason,” he said. “I can work with that. I can make this a lot
                        better.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t you mean ‘<i class="calibre8">probably</i>’?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He smiled warmly. “No, I’m certain I can. But I’ll need you to do something
                        difficult. Something the reports in this file say you’re completely incapable of.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s that?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I need you to trust me,” he said. “No matter what I say or do, I need you to
                        trust
                        me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How can I trust you?” she asked. “I don’t even know your name.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sure you do. It’s Nigel Honeybuns. It’s Gerald Anderson. Sometimes it’s even
                        Croydon St. Vincent Marlborough the Third. It all depends on the situation,” he said with a
                        shrug.
                        “But my friends and colleagues, and I do hope that’s a group you’ll soon consider yourself to be
                        a
                        part of, they all call me Mother.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For the first time since she’d been arrested, Sara laughed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Mother? That’s an unusual name for a man.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“True,” he said, smiling at her. “But I’m an unusual man, wouldn’t you say?”

                    <p>
                    <p> The reports in Sara's file were accurate. She didn’t trust people. Especially adults. To be
                        fair,not
                        many had given her reason to do so. There’d been a few nice teachers along the way. And two
                        good foster families. But that was about it. Now, as she sat in a holding cell waiting to be
                        called
                        into the courtroom, she was having second thoughts about trusting a man who called himself
                        Mother
                        and
                        carried at least three phony passports in his briefcase. </p>
                    <p>"Rich girl, you gonna help me out?"</p>
                    <p>There were only three other girls in the cell, but it took Sara a moment to realize this one was
                        talking to her. She almost laughed at the absurdity of it.

                        "I'm not rich."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They were sitting on blue wooden benches facing each other, about four feet apart. The older,
                        much
                        larger girl leaned closer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I saw your lawyer,” she said. “Shiny suit. Expensive shoes. You’ve gotta have money to have a
                        lawyer like that. Maybe he can help me out too. Or maybe I can look after you. Keep you safe
                        once we
                        get to juvie. It won’t cost your family much.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Leave her along."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The warning came from an unlikely source, a girl named Emily who’d shared a cell with Sara the
                        night
                        before. Her perfectly manicured nails gave the impression that she knew her way around the salon
                        much better than she did a jail cell. She’d told Sara that she’d been arrested for shoplifting
                        and
                        her mother was making her spend the night behind bars to teach her a lesson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "No one was talking to you, princess," the first girl said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Well, if Sara needs anyone to look after her, I'll do it," Emily replied. "So thanks, but no
                        thanks."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first girl stood and towered over them, her attention now fully focused on Emily. "How do
                        you
                        plan on protecting anybody?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Really, guys,” Sara said, trying to calm the situation. “It’s all a misunderstanding. I don’t
                        have
                        any money. And I don’t need any protection.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emily ignored her and got up in the other girl’s face. “I’ll just use these,” she said, flashing
                        her
                        thumbs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "What? You gonna text someone for help on that phone you shoplifted?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “No,” Emily replied flatly. “I’m going to do this.” With lightning speed, she jabbed her thumbs
                        deep
                        into the sides of the larger girl’s rib cage, making her gasp for air and stagger backward. Sara
                        stared in amazement as Emily reached over and carefully guided the other girl back to the bench,
                        making sure she didn’t fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’ll hurt for a while, maybe bruise a bit, but there’s no real damage,” Emily said in a
                        half-whisper. “I can’t promise I’ll go as easy on you next time, so you might want to think
                        twice
                        before you threaten anyone else.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara sat there amazed and was still trying to make sense of it all when a guard came to the
                        door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Martinez, Sara," he announced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She was too distracted to respond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Martinez, Sara," he repeated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "That's me."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Time for court," he said, unlocking the cell door.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sara looked back at Emily, who said, "Good luck in there."</p>
                    <p>“Thanks,” she replied as she got up and started to leave. She nodded toward the girl who was
                        still
                        catching her breath. “Thanks for that, too.”</p>
                    <p>
                        Emily smiled. "It's what cell sisters do, right?"
                    </p>
                    <p>Sara followed the guard into the courtroom. Her mind was still distracted by what had happened
                        between the two girls as she sat at the defendant’s table next to Mother.</p>
                    <p>"You all right?" he asked when he saw her expression.</p>
                    <p>
                        "Yeah," she said. "I'm fine."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Good, because I need your full attention,” he said. “And I need you to remember the part about
                        trusting me.”</p>
                    <p>She didn’t know what to make of him, but there wasn’t any time to figure it out. The bailiff
                        stood
                        and announced the judge’s entrance.</p>
                    <p>“All rise for the Honorable Lyman J. Pancake. Court is now in session.”</p>
                    <p>Mother smirked. “Pancake? Maybe I should’ve gone with Honeybuns aer all. We would’ve been like a
                        breakfast buffet.”</p>
                    <p>Sara didn’t laugh. She wasn’t in a joking mood.</p>
                    <p>Neither was the Honorable Lyman J. Pancake.</p>
                    <p>He might’ve had a funny name, but the rest of him appeared completely humorless. Perhaps a
                        lifetime
                        of listening to flapjack jokes had worn away his good nature. His expression could best be
                        described
                        as puckered, as if he’d just drunk lemonade without enough sugar. What little hair he had left
                        formed a semicircle of white bristle that started above his ears and met somewhere in the back.
                        After some formalities he asked, “How does the defendant plead?”</p>
                    <p>Mother looked up from his briefcase long enough to announce, “Guilty, Your Honor.”</p>
                    <p>
                        Sara knew she was guilty but thought there’d be some negotiations before they admitted it. From
                        what
                        she’d seen on television, guilty people usually started off claiming to be innocent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The judge turned to the prosecuting attorney and asked, “Is there a plea arrangement, Ms.
                        Adams?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prosecutor was tall and lean with short blond hair. Her youthful face hinted that she’d only
                        been out of law school for a few years, and her huge smile indicated she was delighted, if
                        perhaps a
                        bit surprised, to hear the guilty plea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “No, Your Honor,” she replied. “I had preliminary discussions with Ms. Martinez’s original
                        attorney,
                        but no agreement was reached.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “She looks really happy,” Sara whispered nervously. “I don’t think you were supposed to plead
                        guilty.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Is that true, Mr. Anderson?” asked the judge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather than respond, Mother kept shuffling through his papers. It took Sara a moment to realize
                        that
                        it was because he didn’t recognize his phony name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Is that true, Mr. Anderson?” the judge repeated, this time a bit louder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara nudged him. “<i>You’re</i> Mr. Anderson.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Oops,” he whispered to her. “Told you it was forgettable.” He turned his attention to the judge
                        and
                        asked, “Is what true, Your Honor?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That you have not reached a plea arrangement with the prosecution?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s my understanding that opposing counsel has offered a sentence of two and a half years in
                        juvenile detention,” Mother said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That may have been discussed as one of several possibilities,” the prosecutor replied with a
                        Cheshire cat grin. “But like I said, there was no official agreement. And now that there’s an
                        admission of guilt in open court, I’m not inclined to let her off so easy.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sara slumped in her chair. Things were going from bad to worse in a hurry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That’s fine,” said Mother. “Because we find that offer unsatisfactory.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I guarantee you won’t get a better one,” she said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I don’t want a better one,” he replied. “I want one that’s worse.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now Sara was really confused.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I’m sorry, what?” asked the judge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Thirty months just isn’t enough,” Mother replied. “My client compromised highly secure computer
                        files. And, although it’s not listed among the charges, she also hacked into the financial
                        records
                        of a multinational bank.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Hey,” protested Sara. “What about attorney-client privilege?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “That would only apply if I was actually an attorney,” he whispered. He turned back to the judge
                        and
                        continued, “Your Honor, this behavior is serious and calls for more than two and a half years.
                        Personally, I think she should remain in custody until she turns eighteen.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “What are you doing?” Sara pleaded under her breath. “That’s six years.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “One moment, Your Honor,” he said, raising a finger. “I need to confer with my client.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mother leaned over so that he was right next to Sara’s ear. “As crazy as this sounds, this is
                        the
                        part where I need you to trust me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “But you’re arguing for a harsher penalty than they offered,” she said. “That doesn’t make
                        sense.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It will when I’m done,” he replied. “Just give me ninety seconds.” He unclasped his watch and
                        held
                        it up for her. “Then you can decide.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first time she noticed the back of his left hand was covered with burn scars. They
                        continued
                        up past his wrist and disappeared beneath his sleeve. Somehow, she’d overlooked them earlier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “A fire,” he said, reading her reaction. “I’ll tell you about it when we get out of here. But
                        now
                        I’m asking for a minute and a half of trust.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oddly, the scars were what swayed her. They hinted that there was more to him than fast talk and
                        a
                        nice suit. He’d suffered through something, which meant he was tough. Maybe even as tough as
                        her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She took the watch and examined it. “Looks pretty cheap for someone who’s supposed to be a
                        high-priced attorney.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I keep meaning to get a posh one,” he said. “Maybe we can take care of that once we’re done
                        here.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, she nodded her assent. “Okay … but at ninety-one seconds I start telling the judge
                        about
                        fake passports.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Attagirl.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Your Honor, if I may?” interjected the prosecutor. “We can quickly draft an agreement placing
                        Ms.
                        Martinez in a supervised group home until her eighteenth birthday.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Also unsatisfactory,” said Mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Aren’t you the one who just said she should remain in custody until she becomes an adult?” she
                        asked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Yes, but not at a place like that,” said Mother. “All she’ll do there is learn how to be a
                        better
                        criminal. I have an alternative in mind.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-21" class="calibre17">Sara watched the second hand intently. He was down to a
                        minute
                        and seven seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Where?” asked the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall,” replied Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall?” Pancake asked, trying to place the name.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a specialized facility that houses a handful of juvenile offenders,” he
                        replied. “She’ll get one-on-one attention, counseling, and a first-rate education.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are we placing her in detention or sending her to summer camp?” asked the
                        prosecutor. “The taxpayers aren’t footing the bill for that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“All the fees will be paid by a private foundation,” Mother said, waving a
                        sheet of
                        paper from his briefcase. “I have the documentation right here. Sara Martinez will no longer
                        cost
                        the taxpayers a penny.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara didn’t know what to think when she saw the “documentation.” It was a
                        takeout
                        menu from a nearby deli. According to the watch, he was down to twenty-six seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It sounds too good to be true,” said the judge. “Which undoubtedly means it
                        is. We
                        don’t reward criminal behavior with luxury accommodations. Ms. Martinez broke the law, and she
                        will
                        be going into a supervised group home when we’re done here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Ten seconds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You might want to rethink that,” said Mother. “She either goes to Crunchem
                        Hall or
                        we change our plea to ‘not guilty’ and move on to a trial that I can guarantee both of you will
                        regret.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why is that?” asked the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother paused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">His time was up, and he looked at Sara. She was torn. She didn’t know where
                        this
                        was going, but it seemed to being going … <i class="calibre8">somewhere</i>. He had a fake name,
                        no
                        legal training, and his key piece of evidence was a list of twenty-seven different sandwiches.
                        He
                        also told lies with alarming ease. Yet, despite all of this, he seemed totally pleased with how
                        events were unfolding. She handed him back the watch, and he smiled.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This is about to get fun,” he whispered to her confidently.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother turned to the judge. “If we go to trial, the first thing I’ll do is
                        insist
                        you remove yourself from the case.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On what grounds?” he protested.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On the grounds that you’re prejudiced against my client because when she
                        hacked
                        the juvenile justice portal, she came across personal e-mails of yours that are embarrassing in
                        nature.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara had no idea what he was talking about. She hadn’t gotten near any e-mails.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The e-mail server wasn’t compromised,” insisted the judge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then how do I have a copy of this note you sent two weeks ago?” Mother said,
                        and
                        began to read from a piece of paper. “ ‘Yesterday I had dinner with the mayor, and let me tell
                        you
                        that man is an absolute&mdash;’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The judge slammed his gavel repeatedly to keep Mother from reading any further.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why don’t I just put that one down for a second?” Mother said as he laid it on
                        the
                        defense table. “There are also e-mails from various attorneys, such as this one,” he said as he
                        began to read from another. “ ‘How can you take a man seriously when his name is Judge Pancake?
                        Where’d he go to law school? Hash Brown University?’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Objection!” the prosecutor exclaimed as soon as she recognized it as an e-mail
                        she’d written to a friend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He should object, not you,” said Mother. “It’s his name you’re making fun of.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre17">“Your Honor, he’s trying to blackmail us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother laughed. “No, that’s not blackmail. But this next one’s pretty close.”
                        He
                        picked up another paper and started to read. “ ‘About the legal conference last week in Atlantic
                        City, please don’t tell my wife any of …’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Order in the court!” the judge bellowed, pounding his gavel. “Order in the
                        court!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked up at Mother, and he shot her a wink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He turned back to the judge. “There are dozens of such e-mails, and I will make
                        sure that every one is read aloud and placed into the public record, which I can only imagine
                        will
                        be embarrassing for both of you. Or …” He stopped speaking for a moment to give the judge a
                        chance
                        to consider his options.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Tell me more about Crunchem Hall,” said the judge. “Who’s in charge there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Trunchbull,” said Mother. “Very tough.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right, Warden Trunchbull,” the judge said. “Tough … but fair, if I remember
                        correctly. Tell me more.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Four hours later Sara Maria Martinez was released from custody into the care of
                        a
                        man claiming to be Gerald Anderson, attorney-at-law. He signed a few papers, and they exited the
                        courthouse through a revolving door into a sunny Brooklyn afternoon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara took a deep breath of fresh air and asked, “So do you want to explain what
                        happened in there?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We won,” said Mother. “Bit of a drubbing, if I’m being honest.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not so sure we can call that a victory,” she replied. “You got me
                        sentenced to
                        six years in custody.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre17">“True, but they’re to be served at a fictional facility,
                        so it
                        shouldn’t be too difficult.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a look. “What are you talking about?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Crunchem Hall is the school in <i class="calibre8">Matilda</i>,” he explained.
                        “Miss Trunchbull is the evil headmistress. They only exist in a children’s book.” He paused for
                        a
                        moment and added, “Unless you count the movie and the musical, both of which I quite enjoyed.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are you insane?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I only had ninety seconds, and I needed to come up with something,” he said.
                        “The
                        trick was using names that were vaguely recognizable. That way they were more likely to think it
                        was
                        real.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But what if they remembered the book?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The prosecutor seemed too young to have kids, and the judge is old enough that
                        it’s been decades since he read any bedtime stories, so I thought we were probably safe.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Again with the ‘probably.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Life is filled with ‘probablies,’ Sara. You’re going to have to get
                        comfortable
                        with them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If it’s a fictional place, then why did you insist on me being sentenced until
                        I
                        was eighteen?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because you’re no longer the concern of the juvenile courts,” he said. “You’ve
                        been sent away until you’re an adult. No one’s going to come looking for you. No social worker’s
                        going to follow up and knock on your door. You’ve fallen through the cracks of the American
                        judicial
                        system.” He smiled proudly. “So cheers for that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re saying I’m free?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In every way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then what happens now?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Now, it gets interesting,” he said. “You’ve got some massive decisions to
                        make.
                        But first I’d like you to come for a ride.” He motioned toward a limousine waiting nearby. “I
                        want
                        to show you something.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In a limo?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I figured you came here handcuffed in the back of a panda car; the least we
                        can do
                        is leave in style.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Panda car?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A police car,” he explained. “It’s black and white, like a panda.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As she followed him, she asked, “So what made you think of <i
                            class="calibre8">Matilda</i>?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It was written by Roald Dahl,” he said. “He’s my favorite author.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You must really like kids’ books.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I do, but that’s not why he’s my favorite,” said Mother. “He’s my favorite
                        because
                        in addition to being a writer, he was a spy.” Mother stopped, turned back to face her, and said,
                        “Just like me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara laughed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not joking,” he said. “I’m an agent with the British Secret Intelligence
                        Service, also known as MI6. That’s why I have the passports. That’s how I have copies of their
                        e-mails. I command an elite team that is only sent out on high-priority missions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And one of those <i class="calibre8">high-priority</i> missions was keeping me
                        out
                        of juvenile detention?” she replied suspiciously.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This wasn’t a mission so much as it was a recruitment. An emergency one, at
                        that.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re about to go into the field for a critical operation,” he said. “And we
                        just
                        discovered that we need one more person on our team. We thought we’d come over and see if that
                        person might be you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-26" class="calibre17">Mother opened the rear door of the limo, and Sara saw a
                        familiar face looking back at her from inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Emily?” she said, recognizing her “cell sister.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Actually, the name’s Sydney,” she replied with an Australian accent. “Glad he
                        was
                        able to bust you out.”</p>

                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Rather than a prisoner transport</span> bus, Sara left
                        the
                        courthouse in a limousine with two people who claimed to be spies. Surprisingly, she had no
                        doubt
                        that that’s exactly what they were. She just wasn’t sure how she fit into their plans.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me get this straight,” she said as they took Atlantic Avenue deeper into
                        Brooklyn. “You two are a team?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Part of one,” answered Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you came here to see if I was a good fit for that team?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s right,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Am I?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So far, it’s quite promising,” he said, “but we can’t be certain until we
                        conduct
                        some more tests.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean, <i class="calibre8">more</i> tests?” she said. “I haven’t
                        taken
                        any.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Actually, you’ve taken two so far,” he answered. “First when I asked you to
                        hack
                        into the juvenile justice portal and make me your attorney. That’s performance under pressure.
                        An
                        essential skill.” He turned to Sydney. “She did it in under two minutes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Impressive,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The second was trusting me in the courtroom,” he continued. “That demonstrated
                        your ability to adapt to rapidly changing situations. Also essential.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I wish I could’ve been there to see it,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s too bad,” joked Mother. “I was sensational.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-28" class="calibre17">Sydney rolled her eyes and shared a look with Sara. “By
                        the
                        way, I did some shopping earlier.” Sydney handed her two department store bags. “I tried to
                        guess
                        your sizes and what you might like.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked in the bags. “You bought me clothes?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just to hold you over until we can get you a proper wardrobe,” she replied.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Although, most days you’ll wear your school uniform,” added Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a curious look. “My school doesn’t have a uniform.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“About that. You’re going to be enrolled in a new school called Kinloch Abbey.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sounds about as fake as Crunchem Hall,” she said. “Let me guess. It’s from <i
                            class="calibre8">James and the Giant Peach</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, this one’s not in a book,” Mother said. “It’s in Scotland.” Sara waited
                        for
                        him to laugh, but he didn’t. She waited some more, but there was still no laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re serious?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a bit posh,” said Sydney. “After all, part of it’s in a castle. But once
                        you
                        get over that, you’ll like it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re going to Scotland?!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Instead of answering, Mother leaned toward the driver and asked, “Can you
                        please
                        turn left and take us to house number 197?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re pressed for time,” Sydney reminded him. “If we miss this flight, we’ll
                        lose
                        an entire day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know, I know,” he reassured her. “It’s just a quick detour for context.
                        Besides,
                        I really want to see it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m sorry,” Sara interrupted, “but can we get back to the whole Scotland
                        thing?”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-29" class="calibre17">“Shortly,” Mother assured her as the limo parked in front
                        of a
                        three-story redbrick town house. “First, tell me what you know about Winston Churchill.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Absolutely nothing,” she said blankly. “The name sounds … kind of familiar,
                        but
                        that’s it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Jaw-dropping,” he said disapprovingly. “Kinloch will take care of that in a
                        tick.
                        But, for now, just know that as prime minister during World War Two, Churchill saved Britain and
                        quite possibly the world from annihilation. He’s a personal hero of mine and did more for the
                        British Secret Intelligence Service than anyone else.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” she said. “So why are you telling me this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because his mother was born in this house.” He gestured out the window. “Think
                        about that. The mother of the man who saved Britain wasn’t from London or Oxford or some grand
                        estate out in Surrey. She was from Brooklyn, just like you. So it follows that we’d come full
                        circle
                        back here to find you. Brooklyn’s imprinted on our DNA.” He turned his attention back to the
                        driver.
                        “Okay,we can move along now.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo started again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s interesting and all,” said Sara. “But it really doesn’t answer my
                        question.
                        Are you seriously taking me to Scotland? Because I don’t even have a passport.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He popped open his briefcase and handed her two British passports, each with
                        her
                        picture and a phony name. “Pick the one you like better.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Of course,” she replied, shaking her head. “You have all the passports you
                        want.
                        How’d you get this picture of me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That bit about us being spies?” he said. “We’re exceptionally good at getting
                        things. As to your first question, yes, we’re taking you to Scotland. Whether you stay there or
                        not,
                        however, will be entirely up to you.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-30" class="calibre17">“How do you mean?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Soon you’ll start classes at Kinloch. It’s one of the top boarding schools in
                        the
                        UK. You’ll get a first-rate education. And if you’re happy there, you can continue until you
                        graduate and leave for university. That’s option one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And if I don’t like it?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Option two,” he answered. “If, at the end of the school year, you decide
                        Kinloch’s
                        not right for you or that you miss living in the States too much, we’ll find you a proper home
                        back
                        here in America. It won’t be like the ones you’ve been stuck in before. We’ll get you a good
                        family.
                        I’ll see to that. Although, we might want to avoid metropolitan New York because of the whole
                        business about them believing that you’re in detention somewhere.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Good point,” she said. “But what does any of that have to do with spies and
                        MI6?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not a thing.” He leaned in conspiratorially and added, “Option three is the
                        one
                        that involves the Secret Intelligence Service.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She looked at both of them before saying, “Then option three is the one I want
                        to
                        hear about.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You attend Kinloch not as a boarder but as a day student,” said Sydney. “And
                        you
                        live at the farm with Monty, me, and the rest of the team.” “Monty?” asked Sara. “Who’s that?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Dr. Alexandra Montgomery,” said Mother. “She’s a
                        biophysicist-slash-cryptologist
                        who loves to bake. Think of her as part Marie Curie and part Mary Poppins.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She’s brilliant,” said Sydney. “You’re going to love her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And the rest of the team?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Kids like you and me who Mother’s found around the globe,” said Sydney.
                        “They’re
                        amazing.” She rethought this for a moment. “I mean, the boys totally drive me bonkers and I
                        usually
                        want to strangle them, but other than that they’re amazing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How many are there?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Two boys and another girl,” she said. “Paris, Rio, and Kat. When you join the
                        team, you have to create an entirely new identity. It’s hard to keep track of all the aliases
                        and
                        fake names, so we just call each other by where we’re from. That way we still have a small
                        connection to our past.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a city called Kat?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Kathmandu,” answered Mother. “It’s in Nepal but that’s rather a mouthful, so
                        we
                        just go with Kat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That means I’d be Brooklyn,” Sara said, liking the sound of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">If</i> you decide to join,” stressed Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What does <i class="calibre8">joining</i> even mean?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It means that in addition to your studies at Kinloch,” he said, “you’ll
                        receive
                        instruction in espionage, counterintelligence, self-defense, code-breaking, and other assorted
                        goodies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“My favorite assorted goody is explosives,” said Sydney. “I like making things
                        go
                        boom.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So we’re talking spy school?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” said Mother. “But not just school. We go on real missions. We face
                        genuine
                        danger.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you said that there’s a mission coming up that you want me to go on,” Sara
                        replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother sighed. “Normally, you receive extensive training before you go into the
                        field, but we’re in a pinch at the moment. There’s an operation in three weeks, and we find
                        ourselves one person down.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And if that person’s me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then I would limit your role as much as possible, but you would have to go
                        into
                        the field with us.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-32" class="calibre17">“Cool,” she said with a grin. “Sounds more fun than
                        juvenile
                        detention.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara would’ve asked more about the upcoming mission, but she was distracted
                        when
                        the limo turned down a familiar street. It was >her neighborhood and just the sight of it made
                        her
                        wince. Everything here was the opposite of boarding schools and castles. There were chain-link
                        fences with razor wire, iron bars on windows, and graffiti covering the wall of an abandoned
                        warehouse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why are we here?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re about to cross an ocean,” he answered. “I thought you might like to stop
                        by
                        home before we left .”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This isn’t my <i class="calibre8">home</i>,” she corrected. “It’s a <i
                            class="calibre8">house</i> where I lived. There’s a huge difference.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Duly noted,” he said. “But either way, you won’t be returning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">If there’s anything of sentimental value in there, now’s the time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a shoebox with some things that are special to me,” she said. “But I
                        can’t
                        get it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why not?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Clarks are home,” she said. “Considering I just tried to have them
                        arrested, I
                        doubt they’ll hand it over.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then let’s not tell them,” he replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You want me to break in?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In the spy trade we call it a ‘black bag job,’ ” he said. “We’ll make this
                        your
                        first alpha test.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This brought a smile to Sydney’s face. “I like it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s an alpha test?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Every mission has a team leader, called an <i class="calibre8">alpha</i>, who
                        comes up with the plan and runs the operation,” he explained. “To prepare for that, we run alpha
                        tests as practice.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre17">“Except, I haven’t had any training,” Sara replied. “I
                        don’t
                        know how to plan a mission.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t sell yourself short,” Sydney said firmly. “You already have the intel.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave her a confused look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The intelligence,” Sydney explained. “You know the inner workings of the
                        house.
                        All you have to do is break down the variables and devise a scheme. For example, who’s inside
                        right
                        now?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara checked her watch. “It should just be the Clarks,” she said. “The kids are
                        all
                        either at day care or after-school programs for another forty-five minutes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent, so we only have two people to deal with,” said Mother. “Where’s the
                        shoebox?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On the top shelf of my bedroom closet … which is on the third floor.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s not ideal,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And the only way to get there is to go through the living room, where I’m sure
                        Leonard is sitting in his recliner watching television and drinking a beer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Also less than ideal,” he said. “But it’s still clear-cut. You just need some
                        sort
                        of bait that will get them out of the way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s called the nugget,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The nugget?” Sara asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Something to distract them,” answered Sydney. “To lure them from the living
                        room.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do they find … <i class="calibre8">irresistible</i>?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Beer … pizza&nbsp; …” Sara continued thinking as she studied the house. For
                        her it
                        was filled with memories of sadness and disappointment. She looked up at the roof where she and
                        Gabriel had been locked out for an entire night. And that’s when the brainstorm hit. “… and
                        money!”
                        she said. “They love money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I don’t think we have enough cash for a bribe,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s okay,” Sara replied. “Just the idea of money should be enough to get
                        them.
                        Can you pass yourself off as an FBI agent?” “I’d need a wardrobe change,” Mother said. He opened
                        his
                        briefcase and pulled out a black tie, which he swapped with the stylish patterned one he was
                        wearing. Then he took out his pocket square and put on a pair of dark sunglasses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wardrobe change complete,” he said. “What’s the plan?”</p>
                    </p>

                    <h2><strong>4. </strong>The Alpha Test</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Perhaps because of their own dishonesty and
                            criminal inclinations, Leonard and Deborah Clark viewed the United States government with
                            deep-seated paranoia. Leonard was always on the lookout for the “surveillance drones” he
                            claimed flew nightly missions over Brooklyn. “They’re spying on us,” he’d say angrily. “Our
                            own government is spying on us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It was this suspicion, combined with the Clarks’ unbridled greed, that formed
                        the basis of Sara’s plan. She needed them out of the way long enough to slip up to her old room
                        and come back down without being noticed. To do that, Mother had to lure them away with what he
                        and Sydney had called the nugget.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo driver parked around the corner, and the girls hid across the street
                        behind a car, while Mother went up the stoop and rang the bell. As he always did, Leonard Clark
                        peered through a side window to see who was there. After eyeing Mother suspiciously, he cracked
                        the door slightly open and said, “What?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are you Leonard Clark?” Mother asked, using a Texas drawl and doing his best
                        to project FBI cool and calm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who wants to know?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Federal Bureau of Investigation.” Mother flashed an official-looking
                        badge. “I’m Special Agent Marlborough of the cybercrimes division.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Leonard shifted uneasily but said nothing.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-36" class="calibre17">“I’m here because of your daughter,” Mother continued.
                        “Sara Martinez.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That girl’s not my daughter,” Clark replied, wagging an angry finger. “She’s a
                        criminal who belongs in jail.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Be that as it may,” said Mother, “it has come to our attention that she
                        recently hacked into a bank and made a substantial withdrawal.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Clark’s eyes opened wide. “Did she take money out of my account? Because if she
                        did …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, sir,” Mother replied. “The money was procured from the bank’s currency
                        reserves. We have reason to believe she hid the cash here on the premises.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Suddenly the mention of cash hidden in his home put a smile on Clark’s face.
                        “How much are we talking?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not at liberty to share that information,” responded Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But you said it was ‘a substantial withdrawal.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Please, sir. If I could just come in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Leonard began to formulate a strategy fueled entirely by greed. “Why do you
                        want to come into my house?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Obviously, I need to retrieve the money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You got a search warrant?” asked Leonard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, sir, I don’t,” Mother replied. “But I don’t actually need to search your
                        property. I just need access to your roof.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So that’s where she hid it,” said Clark. “Up on the roof. Clever girl.
                        Devious, but clever.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Please, sir,” said Mother. “It will only take a moment.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sorry, buddy. No warrant, no entry. I know my rights.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother played the part beautifully as he feigned frustration and pretended to
                        call a superior. “The homeowner is noncompliant,” he said into his phone. “Activate drone
                        retrieval.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre17">“What?!” bellowed Clark. “You’re not coming at my house
                        with them drones.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ve given me no alternative,” said Mother. “They should be here any
                        minute.” He looked to the sky as if waiting for a squadron of drones to swoop into action.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Clark slammed the door shut, and Mother heard the sound of the bolt locking. He
                        leaned over to the side window and pleaded, “Perhaps we can work out some sort of finder’s fee
                        for you and your wife.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Leonard flashed a grin and yanked the curtains closed. Mother waited a moment
                        before motioning the girls over from their hiding place.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How’d it go?” Sara asked as she dug in her pocket for her house key.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just like you said it would,” answered Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She pressed her ear up to the window and listened until she heard the sound of
                        the door to the roof slam shut.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They’re on the roof,” she said. “They’ll tear it apart looking for that
                        money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She unlocked the door and quietly raced up the stairs to the third floor with
                        Sydney following close behind. They entered a room where three beds had been fit together like a
                        jigsaw puzzle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Look at that,” Sara said, pointing at a bare mattress and empty nightstand.
                        “They’ve already gotten rid of my stuff.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Think they tossed your shoebox?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No way,” she said. “I hid it too well.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara stood on her tiptoes so she could reach the top shelf of the closet and
                        groped around until she felt what she was looking for.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Got it,” she said as she carefully pulled down a pale blue box, its color
                        faded with age. She held it tightly, making sure not to spill its contents. “Let’s get out of
                        here.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-38" class="calibre17">Back in the hall they heard the commotion on the roof as
                        the Clarks frantically searched for the nonexistent money. The plan had worked perfectly, and
                        she and Sydney had an easy getaway …until Sara froze.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She stood motionless and thought about the cruelty she’d witnessed from the
                        Clarks. She looked at the closet where they’d locked Gabriel and thought about how scared he’d
                        been that night on the roof.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hurry up,” said Sydney. “We’ve got what we came for.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked at Sydney for a moment and then at the door to the roof, her anger
                        building as she remembered the sound of Gabriel’s sobbing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sara!” Sydney said urgently. “Believe me when I say we don’t want them to
                        catch us in this house. It could ruin everything.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara ignored her and went up the final flight to the roof access.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What are you doing?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Letting them know how it feels.” Sara reached for the door and turned the
                        lock, trapping them on the roof. “That’s for Gabriel.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sydney sighed. “Okay, I like that. But can we go now?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You bet we can,” Sara said. “I don’t ever want to see this dump again.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They rushed down the stairs and burst out the front door. Just as they reached
                        the sidewalk, they could hear Deborah Clark call to her husband.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The door, Lenny! It’s locked!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo pulled up, stopping just long enough for them to hop in. They were
                        still laughing as they pulled away down the street.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I missed something,” Mother said, looking at the two of them. “What’s so
                        funny?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I locked them on the roof,” Sara said, satisfied. “Just like they did to
                        Gabriel and me.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre17">“That wasn’t part of the plan,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” she countered. “But you said I was the alpha.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you said that the alpha is in charge of the mission once it’s
                        operational.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Also true,” he admitted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So, I made it part of the plan,” she said defiantly. “Did I pass the test? Am
                        I three for three?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” answered Mother. “You passed. And, while I see the appeal of locking
                        them on the roof, it probably wasn’t the best thing to do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Life is filled with ‘probabilities,’ ” she said, repeating his line</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">back to him. “I guess we’re both going to have to get used to them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">A smile slowly formed on his face, and he chuckled.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m wondering what I’ve gotten us into,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara grinned. She spun around in her seat and looked back toward the house as
                        it disappeared in the distance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They’ll be stuck up there until the kids get home,” she said. “I wonder what
                        they’ll tell them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nothing,” replied Mother. “The kids aren’t coming home.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">A panicked Sara turned back to face him and asked, “Why not?</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">What happened to them?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Everything’s fine,” he assured her. “At MI6 we have friends in American law
                        enforcement. We passed along the files you hacked as well as some others we found and asked them
                        to dig a bit deeper. Right now, a senior social worker is meeting with the children and seeing
                        to it that all of them are assigned to better homes. Meanwhile, the New York Office of Children
                        and Family Services is taking
                        a closer look at the Clarks and their history as foster parents. The roof is only the beginning
                        of their
                        problems.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara was stunned. “You did that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, Sara, you did,” he said. “I just made a few phone calls. You did the
                        difficult work. I know you’re not familiar with it, but this is what justice feels like. This is
                        what we’re all about.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As Sara considered this, she reflexively hugged the shoebox against her chest.
                        Her defiant attitude melted away and tears</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">began to stream down her face. She didn’t try to stop them. For the first time
                        in her life she didn’t mind someone seeing her cry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The others were quiet for a moment until Sydney placed a gentle hand on her
                        knee. “Are you okay?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara wiped away some of the tears and nodded. “Better than okay,” she said. “I
                        just don’t understand how all of this happened. This morning I woke up in jail, and now I’m
                        about to fly to Scotland for spy training. It’s just so … overwhelming.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know exactly what you mean,” said Sydney. “I felt the same way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a lot to take in,” said Mother. “I’m sure you have some questions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Only a few thousand,” joked Sara. “I don’t even know where to start.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How about we start at the beginning?” He looked down at the scars on his hand.
                        “Why don’t I tell you about the fire?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The limo glided into traffic heading toward JFK Airport.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Five years ago, I went to Paris on a top-secret mission called Operation
                        Gumdrop.…”</p>

                    <h2><strong>5. </strong>Operation Gumdrop</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre8">Paris, France&mdash;Five Years Earlier</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Despite its playful name, Operation</span> Gumdrop was
                        deadly serious. Mother had spent more than a year trying to infiltrate Umbra, a global crime
                        syndicate made up of mercenaries, terrorists, and former intelligence agents. Its leader was a
                        shadowy figure known simply as <i class="calibre8">Le Fantôme</i>, which was
                        French for “the Ghost.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Little was known about him, although it was believed that, in addition to being
                        a master criminal, he was also an avid art collector. This was why Mother went to Paris posing
                        as a black-market dealer with three priceless Monets. MI6 didn’t think Le Fantôme would trust an
                        underling to judge whether they were forgeries. If Mother could arrange a face-to-face meeting,
                        he might be able to arrest him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">A key to this plan was setting up shop in an abandoned factory on the outskirts
                        of the city. The factory had once manufactured candy, which was how Operation Gumdrop got its
                        name.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother looked at the building through a rusted chain-link fence. Its royal-blue
                        walls were dull and peeling. Broken windows lined the second floor, and the parking lot was
                        overrun with weeds and wildflowers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Beautiful,” he said, taking it all in. “Absolutely beautiful.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">With bolt cutters for the chain on the fence and a lockpick for the main door,
                        he was inside in less than ninety seconds. Skeletal remains of
                        old machinery filled the factory floor and reminded him of the dinosaur exhibits at the Museum
                        of Natural
                        History. A wall was lined with giant sacks of sugar long since devoured by rats.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This was where he planned to set his trap. Just as rodents had been lured into
                        the building by the sweet scent of sugar, Mother hoped Le Fantôme would be unable to resist the
                        temptation of three stolen Monets, which were in fact masterful forgeries confiscated by
                        Scotland Yard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">On the second floor Mother found a row of offices that had once housed <i
                            class="calibre8">Confiserie Royale S.A.</i>&mdash;or the Royal
                        Candy Corporation&mdash;a grandiose name for a company that manufactured low-quality gummies and
                        lollipops. He looked in each office and found nothing of interest until he reached the final
                        one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As the beam from his flashlight swept the floor, he spied a blanket and pillow
                        laid out like a bed. Next to them a row of books was neatly lined against the wall. He squatted
                        down and ran his finger along their spines. Some titles were in English and others in French. He
                        smiled when he noticed they’d been alphabetized by author.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He turned on a reading lamp by the pillow, and amber light filled a corner of
                        the room. That’s when he heard the rustling behind him. He spun around, rising to his feet,
                        expecting to confront either an attacker or a rodent, but instead saw only a boy cowering behind
                        an overturned desk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother exhaled deeply and, once his pulse calmed, said, <i
                            class="calibre8">“Bonjour.”</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy did not respond.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">“Je ne suis pas la police,”</i> Mother told him. “I’m not
                        the police.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He carefully placed the flashlight on the floor and held up empty hands to show
                        that he meant no harm. The boy responded by cautiously
                        moving out from behind the desk, keeping his back to the wall and his eyes fixed on the man. He
                        looked to be
                        about ten or eleven years old and wore several layers of clothes to fight the winter cold. He
                        had dark skin and cropped hair, and he looked like he was ready to bolt for the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Please don’t run,” said Mother. “You speak English, right?” He motioned to the
                        books on the floor. “I say that because some of the books are in English and my French is not
                        very good.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy did not answer but nodded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not going to hurt you,” Mother promised. “Is this your home?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Another nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do you live here with the rest of your family?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy spoke for the first time. “No family.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother noticed a dingy yellow electrical cord leading to a larger lamp in the
                        corner of the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m just going to reach over and turn this on,” he said, slowly moving toward
                        the lamp, careful not to scare the boy away. “So we can see better. Is that okay?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This illuminated the entire room, and now Mother saw that, in addition to the
                        makeshift bed and books, there was a drawer on the floor holding several items of neatly folded
                        clothing. There was also a chess set with the pieces arranged in the middle of a game.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who are you playing?” he asked, worried another, possibly larger, person might
                        be hiding nearby.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I play myself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother was both relieved and saddened. His first instinct was that the boy’s
                        accent was from Central Africa. That would mean he was far from
                        home and completely alone. He examined the progress of the match and said, “You’re good.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do you play?” asked the boy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I do.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Want to play me?” This was accompanied by a hopeful grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I wish I had the time,” said Mother. “But unfortunately, I don’t.” His mind
                        raced as he tried to solve this unexpected wrinkle in his plan. “You live here alone?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But the fence was locked. How’d you get in?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I have a secret way,” said the boy. “So no one can follow me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Where is it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy smiled. “If I told you, it would not be a secret.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Fair enough,” Mother conceded. “Can you tell me your name?</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Or is that a secret too?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They call me <i class="calibre8">Le Roi du Paris</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">At first he thought the boy had said “Leroy,” as in the name, but then he
                        remembered that in French “<i class="calibre8">le roi</i>” meant “the
                        king.” He chuckled. “You’re the king of Paris?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They call me that to make fun of me, but I do not care.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, I’m not going to make fun of you,” said Mother. “So which would you
                        rather I call you? Leroy or Paris?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The boy shrugged. “Paris, I think.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay, Paris, I’d like to make a business arrangement with you.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I’d like to rent this building for the next month. I’ll pay a generous rate.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I do not understand.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s hard to explain,” said Mother. “But I need this building …for my work.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I will share it with you,” said Paris. “There is enough room for us both. We
                        can play chess when you are not working.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-45" class="calibre17">“I’m afraid that’s not possible,” he said. “It wouldn’t be
                        safe for you. You need to go someplace else.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">According to MI6 protocol, Mother had three options: cancel the operation, move
                        to a different location, or use intimidation to get rid of Paris. But he’d spent a year getting
                        to this point, the building was perfect for his needs, and he couldn’t bring himself to threaten
                        a child. So, he came up with a fourth option instead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They went shopping.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother bought Paris new clothes and a winter coat. He arranged for him to stay
                        in an MI6 safe house and fed him better than he’d ever been fed. They even squeezed in time for
                        a few games of chess. Part of the arrangement, though, was that Paris was not allowed to come
                        anywhere near the factory.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This was a rule the boy broke every evening just after sunset when he snuck
                        back to spy on his new friend. Paris watched one night as Mother unloaded wooden crates from the
                        back of a moving truck. Another time, he saw him installing hidden surveillance cameras. He
                        couldn’t imagine what the Englishman was planning, but his curiosity was piqued.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris didn’t see anyone else there for three weeks, until he arrived one night
                        to find two black Mercedes parked in front of the factory. A light snow had fallen, and one
                        car’s engine was idling. He assumed someone was inside using the heater, although the tinted
                        windows made it impossible to tell.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He crept closer and hid behind an abandoned delivery truck. When he heard
                        people coming out of the building, he crawled under the truck to spy on them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The group consisted of a woman and three men, with no sign of Mother. One man
                        had a gun and constantly scanned the road, looking for possible threats. The other two carried
                        narrow wooden boxes, which they loaded into one of the trunks.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-46" class="calibre17">A fourth man got out of the car and began an angry
                        conversation with the others. He was bald with a gray-black beard and wire-framed glasses. Paris
                        couldn’t make out the language they spoke, so he crawled closer to hear better. He must have
                        made a noise because two of the men instantly looked his way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris pressed his body against the cold, hard ground and said a silent prayer,
                        hoping they didn’t see him. He tried not to move a muscle, but a moment later he heard a bang
                        and the sound of glass exploding. He assumed the guard with the gun had shot at the truck and
                        broken its windshield, but when he opened his eyes, everyone was looking up at the building.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There was more exploding glass, and Paris inched forward so he could look up
                        from beneath the truck. That’s when he saw the fire burning inside the factory. The sound had
                        been a second-floor window shattering due to the heat. He waited for the people to react, but
                        they just stood there watching the building burn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">In the same room where he first discovered Paris, Mother was about to die. His
                        hands were tied behind his back, his feet were wrapped together with wire, and a rag had been
                        forced into his mouth so he couldn’t scream for help. He writhed on the floor, trying to break
                        free, his face covered in sweat from the heat of the >nearby flames. He strained with all his
                        might, but there was nothing he could do to loosen the bindings. Each breath filled his lungs
                        with smoke and brought him closer to death.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He closed his eyes and did his best to accept that this was where his life
                        would come to an end. He tried to figure out where he’d gone wrong. How he’d wound up in this
                        situation. But mostly he thought
                        about the woman who Paris had seen outside the building.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It was Mother’s wife, Clementine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She was also an MI6 agent, yet she’d betrayed him and their country to join
                        forces with Umbra. How could she have done that? How could the woman he loved leave him to die
                        in a fire?</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pushed those questions away and instead thought about their two children. He
                        wanted their faces to be the last pictures in his mind. He heard the crackling of the wooden
                        floor as the fire closed in on him, but just as he started to fade away, the gag was yanked from
                        his mouth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother hacked out smoke and opened his eyes, expecting to see his wife. But she
                        wasn’t his rescuer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It was Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Get out of here,” Mother said, coughing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Quiet,” replied the boy. “They are still outside. Do not let them hear you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The flames dancing along the wall cast eerie shadows on Paris’s face as he
                        struggled to free Mother’s wrists.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You need to save yourself,” Mother insisted. “Even if you can untie me, we
                        can’t escape without them seeing us. They’ll hurt you, too.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Finally the knot loosened and came undone. Paris smiled at Mother and said,
                        “Maybe now I will show you my secret way out of the building.”</p>

                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre8">Edinburgh, Scotland&mdash;Present Day</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">The sounds of morning commuters</span> echoed through
                        Waverley station, interrupted every minute or so by a woman announcing arrivals and departures
                        over the public address system. Paris had just gotten off the train from Aberdeen and was in a
                        hurry as he expertly navigated the jumble of passengers and luggage trolleys that filled
                        platform twelve.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It had been five years since he’d saved Mother from the fire, and during that
                        time he’d grown seven inches and added fifty pounds. But his physical transformation was nothing
                        compared to the other changes in his life. The Rwandan refugee who lived >alone in an abandoned
                        factory was now part of a family in which he played the role of protective older brother. He’d
                        flourished in his new environment, adapting in every way except one: No matter how hard he
                        tried, he simply could not get used to the weather.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Looking up through the glass-paneled roof, he saw the sky was nothing more than
                        a dismal swirl of black and gray with no hint the sun even existed. “Another lovely day in
                        Scotland,” he muttered as he flipped up the collar of his overcoat and braced for the cool, damp
                        air that would greet them outside the station. “Hurry up,” he said, turning to the others.
                        “We’re on a schedule.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So’s my stomach,” replied Rio, who’d stopped in front of a takeaway stall with
                        a display case full of pasties. They’d skipped school in order to be at the airport when Sara
                        arrived. And while Rio didn’t mind missing class, he definitely minded missing lunch. “Just give
                        me a minute,” he said as he checked his wallet. “And spot me a fiver.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No and no,” Paris answered. “We don’t have a minute, and you already owe me
                        twenty quid.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio made an exasperated gesture toward Kat, who stood next to him eating an egg
                        sandwich. “How come she has time to eat and I don’t?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because this morning, she got up early and packed a lunch,” answered Paris.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Once I checked the train timetables and factored in how long it would take to
                        get to the airport, I knew I wouldn’t get a chance to eat otherwise,” she said before taking
                        another bite.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s called planning ahead,” Paris said. “You might try it sometime.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio pointed to the other half-sandwich she was carrying, its delicious goodness
                        wrapped in neatly creased wax paper. “I don’t suppose you factored sharing into your equation.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat tried not to laugh too hard with her mouth full.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’ll be food at the airport,” Paris promised as he headed up the exit
                        ramp. “But right now we’ve got to move. If we’re not there before they land, this whole trip
                        will be a waste.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The three of them were serving as Sara’s welcoming party, but with a twist.
                        They weren’t actually going to greet her so much as they were going to spy on her. After all,
                        they worked for MI6. Spying was their specialty. They wouldn’t officially meet her until later
                        at the house. But introductions like those were awkward, making it hard to get a good read on
                        someone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They were just weeks away from an important mission, and if she was going to be
                        part of their team, they wanted their first impressions to be unfiltered. So rather than
                        bringing balloons and a banner that read <span class="calibre7">WELCOME TO THE UK</span>, they
                        headed for the airport with surveillance equipment and hidden transmitters ready for
                        reconnaissance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I hope she’s nice,” Paris said as they exited onto Waverley Bridge. “And plays
                        chess. I’m tired of beating you lot.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I just want her to stay out of my room,” said Kat. “I don’t like it when
                        people touch my things.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really?” Rio said. “We never would have guessed that from the padlock on your
                        door or that expression you make whenever someone stands close to you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She shot him a dirty look, and he laughed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just stating facts,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Besides, it doesn’t make sense to add someone right now,” Kat continued.
                        “There’s not enough time to prepare.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, it makes sense to Mother,” said Paris. “And that’s all that matters.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They boarded a sky-blue double-decker bus that ran from the train station to
                        the airport, and found the top deck empty. The privacy allowed them to continue their “spy talk”
                        as they sat sideways across the back three rows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What about you?” Paris asked Rio. “What do you hope she’s like?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m with Kat,” he said. “I don’t think we should add anyone so close to a
                        mission. But, if we’re going to do it, I just hope she’s younger than me. I’m tired of being the
                        youngest.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why?” asked Kat. “What’s bad about that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He gave her an incredulous look. “Every. Single. Thing. I get leftovers. I get
                        hand-me-downs. And most of the time, I get overlooked.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris scoffed. “That’s rubbish.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre17">“Is it?” asked Rio. “Take today, for example. Why are you
                        the alpha?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because I’m the …” Paris thought about the right phrasing before saying, “…
                        most experienced.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s just another way of saying ‘oldest,’ ” said Rio. “Coming here was my
                        idea, but I bet you never considered letting me plan it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I would’ve,” he said defensively. “But it’s a tricky mission.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This isn’t a mission,” Rio protested. “A mission’s nicking files from the
                        Russian embassy without getting caught. Which we both did even though you got most of the
                        credit. This is … <i class="calibre8">sightseeing</i>. We’re just going to follow a girl.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hey,” Kat said, offended.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not saying it because she’s a girl,” he responded. “I’m saying it because
                        she hasn’t had any training. We’re not even going to come into contact with her. It’s
                        easy-peasy. But you still wouldn’t let me be the alpha. And it’s too bad, because I’d ace it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio liked to joke, but Paris could tell this was different. This was something
                        that had been building up inside him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I even solved the problem,” Rio added.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What problem?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The one you haven’t mentioned because you don’t know what to do about it,” he
                        answered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris waited for more, but Rio didn’t elaborate. “All right,</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">enlighten me. What problem haven’t I solved?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio shook his head. “It doesn’t matter what I think. I’m not the alpha. I’m
                        just a helper. I’ll do what I’m told and keep my mouth shut. Even when this whole thing goes
                        pear-shaped.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris turned to Kat, who rolled her eyes and nodded her approval.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” said Paris. “<i class="calibre8">You</i> can be the alpha.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-52" class="calibre17">“Really?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m handing you the reins, mate. Now, what’s the problem?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This bus,” Rio said, eager to share his thinking. “When she exits the airport,
                        she’s either going to take the bus or the tram into the city.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s the problem with that?” asked Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Following her means we need to get on board,” he said. “That’s fine on the
                        tram because there’re seven cars. But if she rides the bus, she’ll likely see us. And then
                        she’ll recognize us tonight at dinner.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris nodded. “You’re right. I <i class="calibre8">was</i> worried about that.
                        What’s your solution?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Three positions,” Rio said. “First, a lookout right outside International
                        Arrivals. The lookout identifies Sara and describes her to the others. Second, someone in the
                        terminal to see if she takes the bus or the tram.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And third?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Already waiting back in the city,” Rio said with a sly grin. “No matter which
                        way she goes, the third person has time to get to the bus stop or the tram station and follow
                        her from there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s clever,” said Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio grinned and kept going. “The key position is going to be the lookout.
                        Mother always makes us split up as soon as we get through passport control. That means she’ll be
                        by herself when she comes through the door. The lookout has to pick her out of the crowd.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Got it,” said Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio stopped and looked at her. “What do you mean, <i class="calibre8">got
                            it</i>?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I mean I’ll have no problem spotting her,” she said, as if it were obvious.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What makes you think you’re the lookout?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-53" class="calibre17">“Common sense, past experience,” she replied. “The fact
                        that I’m better at it than either of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris went to protest, but Kat held up a hand to stop him. “Just stating
                        facts.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, I’m sorry you feel that way, but you’re wrong,” replied Rio. “It’s the
                        hardest job. It’s the most important job. And since I’m the alpha, I’m the lookout.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But I’m …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No buts,” Rio said, cutting her off. “There’s no way I’m changing my mind.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll give you the other half of my sandwich,” she said, holding it up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Deal,” he said without hesitation as he snatched it from her hand. “Kat’s the
                        lookout.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Oh, you’re some alpha,” said Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You bet I am,” Rio said as he unwrapped the sandwich and took a huge bite. “I
                        was always going to make Kat the lookout. I was just hungry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s okay,” she replied. “I was always going to give you the sandwich.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Where do I fit in this plan?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re in the terminal,” Rio said with a swallow. “I’m going to ride back to
                        the city center and wait for her there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris smiled. “Which gives you just enough time to run back to the pasty shop
                        and get a pie.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Traditional Cornish steak with beef, potatoes, and onions in a golden-brown
                        crust,” Rio replied, savoring the thought of it. “Like I said, it’s the perfect plan. At least
                        it is if you spot me the five quid.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The bus reached the airport, and the passengers started to get off. Paris
                        reluctantly handed Rio a five-pound note and said, “That makes twenty-five you owe me now.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-54" class="calibre17">“I know,” he said. “I’m good for it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay, is that everything?” Kat asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” answered Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then say it,” she told him. “It’s the alpha’s job, and we can’t start without
                        it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio grinned from ear to ear. “This operation is hot. We are a go.”</p>

                <article>
                    <h2><strong>7. </strong>Chaos Theory</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Mother liked to make up</span> little sayings, called
                        Motherisms, to help his team remember key principles of spycraft. One of his favorites was <i
                            class="calibre8">You can’t look out if you stand out</i>. This was a reminder that an
                        essential element of surveillance was disappearing into the background.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat often found this challenging in Scotland, where it seemed like everyone was
                        fair-skinned. She was Nepali and had a dark complexion that most people mistook for Indian or
                        Pakistani but was impossible to confuse with Scottish. Luckily, with travelers from around the
                        world, the airport gave her plenty of places to blend in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She found a perfect spot in the coffee shop near customs and immigration.
                        Rather than solid walls, it had angled wooden slats designed to let in plenty of light. This
                        gave her an ideal vantage point where she could hide from view but still see everyone passing
                        through the International Arrivals gate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat was an excellent lookout because she saw the world differently. The complex
                        math that continuously ran through her head tended to make her socially awkward, but also let
                        her identify patterns where everyone else saw chaos.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I still don’t understand how you do it,” said Rio, talking to her >through the
                        tiny earpiece she was wearing. “What’s the trick?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You think everything’s a trick,” she whispered into the microphone hidden in
                        her coat’s lapel. “But it’s not. It’s just maths.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre17">Even though Rio had ridden the bus back to Edinburgh, and
                        Paris was waiting in another part of the terminal, they were able to talk to each other using a
                        custom-made communication app on their phones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How many passengers are on an international flight?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“At least two hundred fifty,” Paris answered, joining in the conversation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And how many have landed in the last half hour?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris checked the arrivals monitor and answered, “Four: Bangkok, Amsterdam,
                        Istanbul, and New York.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That means there are at least one thousand people coming through Passport
                        Control,” said Rio. “How is finding one person out of a thousand not a trick?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Your first mistake is thinking of it as one thousand people,” Kat answered.
                        “It’s easier to calculate as four groups of two hundred fifty. Each group acts as a single unit.
                        They get off the plane together. They get their baggage together. They go through customs
                        together. And you can instantly eliminate three of the groups.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Bangkok, Amsterdam, Istanbul, and New York have different ethnicities and
                        styles of dress,” she explained. “My only concern is the group that’s predominantly American.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That makes sense,” said Paris. “But it still leaves you with two hundred fifty
                        people.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, it leaves me with a single <i class="calibre8">group</i> made up of two
                        hundred fifty people,” she replied. “And one person in that group won’t fit in with the other
                        two hundred forty-nine. That’s your one in a thousand.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre17">“I still don’t get it,” said Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’d love to explain it in more detail,” she replied. “But I just spotted Sara,
                        so we should probably start following her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How confident are you that it’s her?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I didn’t say <i class="calibre8">I think</i> I spotted her,” replied Kat. “I
                        said I spotted her. That means I’m one-hundred-percent confident. She looks about twelve years
                        old. Latina. Brown hair pulled back in a ponytail. Jeans and a blue sweatshirt with white
                        trainers. I’m sending a picture.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat pretended to text someone but actually snapped a photo of Sara and sent it
                        to the others.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How can you be positive it’s her?” pressed Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I could go through the maths again,” she replied. “Or you could just look at
                        the picture and see that she’s carrying Sydney’s purple rucksack.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The key to spotting Sara had been simple. The pattern she didn’t fit was that
                        she was a twelve-year-old girl by herself instead of with her parents. Kat knew to look for that
                        because Mother always insisted they separate in an airport. He said the combination of queues
                        and cameras made it the easiest place for a spy to be photographed and identified.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Between airport security, government surveillance, and tourists taking vacation
                        snaps, you were bound to have your picture taken multiple times. And, with the advances in
                        facial recognition so ware, there was always a danger he could be identified, which is why he
                        didn’t want any of the kids on the team to risk having their picture taken with him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother also saw this as a chance for Sara’s RV test. He gave her detailed
                        instructions to an RV, or rendezvous point, in the city. They were stored in a new mobile phone
                        along with an emergency number in case she got lost. Sara was determined not to use the number.
                        She wanted to ace her tests. Her first instruction was to find the sign marked <span
                            class="calibre7">AIRLINK BUS</span>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Paris, she’s moving toward you,” said Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I got her,” he replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Roger that,” Kat answered as she le the coffee shop and disappeared into the
                        crowd. She needed to make sure Mother and Sydney didn’t spot her when they came through the
                        gate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris stood by a Visit Scotland kiosk trying to blend in with a group of
                        students on a school trip. As Sara walked toward him, he got a good look at her face. He noticed
                        her eyes were darting side to side, trying to take everything in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She looks nervous,” he said to the others.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s understandable,” said Kat. “I was terrified when I</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">arrived.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not me,” Rio said confidently.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really?” Paris retorted. “Because I could’ve sworn that was you crying
                        yourself to sleep the first few nights at the farm.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There was silence on the other end, and Paris felt bad for bringing it up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara checked the directions on her phone right before she passed Paris. He gave
                        her about ten feet before he started following. Once they exited the terminal, he closed the gap
                        enough to eavesdrop on her conversation with the attendant at the Airlink ticket window.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Is this the bus to Waverley Bridge?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” answered the man. “It’s four and a half pounds.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She gave him a confused look. “Four and a half pounds of what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s the price of the fare.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It took a moment, and then Sara flashed an embarrassed smile. “Right. Because
                        here pounds are money and not how much something weighs.” She handed him one of the five-pound
                        notes Mother had given her and boarded the bus.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris chuckled to himself and kept walking. “I can already tell that I like
                        her,” he said to the others. “She just got on the one hundred bus and should be there in twenty
                        minutes, Rio. Kat and I will take the tram and catch up with you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Roger that,” mumbled Rio, his mouth full of Cornish beef pasty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sounds like you’ve already spent my money,” said Paris. “How’s the pie?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Delicious,” Rio answered, contorting his body so no gravy dripped on his
                        shirt. “Absolutely delicious.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The pie was an appropriate reward for what had been a good morning. Not only
                        had Rio stood up for himself but also now his plan was working perfectly. This was the first
                        time he’d been an alpha for anything other than practice. Although Mother wouldn’t know about
                        it, at least Paris and Kat would see what he could do.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">His problem wasn’t just that he was the youngest. He felt like he was
                        overlooked because he wasn’t as good a student as the >others. School was a struggle, and this
                        was a chance to show that his street smarts more than made up for it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He finished the pasty and took a position on Waverley Bridge, which connected
                        the old part of the city and its medieval streets to the new, modern section. He spotted Sara as
                        she got off the bus and walked toward New Town.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve got her,” he told the others. “She’s heading toward Princes Street.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’ll take another fifteen minutes for the tram to get there,”Paris responded.
                        “So you’re on your own until then.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I can handle it,” he answered cockily. “Like I told you, easy-peasy.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-60" class="calibre17">Princes Street was the city’s main shopping avenue. One
                        side was lined with stores and boutiques while the other ran beside a mile-long park that
                        provided postcard-perfect views of Edinburgh Castle. Sara stopped several times to make sure she
                        was following the directions properly, once making a U-turn only to spin around and head back in
                        the original direction a few feet later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s no way she’ll be ready for a mission in three weeks,” Rio said to the
                        others. “She’s totally lost.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a new city,” Paris said, defending her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We go to a lot of new cities and can’t afford to stop and ask directions,” Rio
                        replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He followed her into Jenners, a large department store that filled an entire
                        city block. It had operated out of the same location since 1838, and its three-story atrium was
                        ideal for spy work. Rio would’ve looked out of place following Sara through women’s fashions on
                        the middle level but was able to watch her from the balcony of home furnishings one floor above.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re in Jenners,” he said. “This may be the RV location.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Careful,” said Paris. “Mother and Sydney could be nearby.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, I know that,” answered Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Keep your distance, and make sure they don’t see you,” Paris continued.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know that, too,” Rio replied, exasperated.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re off the tram and headed your way,” said Paris. “As soon as we get there,
                        we can take turns tailing her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio tried to ignore the fact that Paris was giving instructions like he was the
                        alpha. “Roger that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Think it’s the RV?” asked Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t know,” said Rio. “Right now, she’s looking at watches.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Any sign of Mother or Sydney?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre17">“Don’t you think I would’ve mentioned that when Kat asked
                        me if I thought this was the RV?” Rio replied. “Letting me be the alpha means not treating me
                        like I’m a total plank.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sorry, mate,” Paris said. “Old habits.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio watched intently as Sara tried on several watches. The salesperson helping
                        her was distracted when another customer asked a question. When she looked away, Sara slyly slid
                        one of the jewelry boxes off the counter and into her backpack.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio was so stunned, it took him a moment to react. “I don’t believe it!” he
                        exclaimed. “I don’t believe it!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She just nicked a watch.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The salesperson turned her attention back to Sara, who was once again admiring
                        the watch she had on. The woman obviously had no idea that one of the boxes was missing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I mean she nicked a watch,” said Rio. “It was on the counter, and she slipped
                        it into her backpack when the saleswoman looked away.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara handed the watch she was trying on back to the woman and left the counter.
                        Once she was about fifteen feet away, she picked up her pace.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That doesn’t make sense,” said Kat. “Why would she do that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll make sure to ask her,” Rio replied as he tried to keep up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">“But right now she’s doing a runner.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio bumped into a couple looking at living room furniture, and by the time he
                        got around them, Sara had disappeared into the crowd. He sprinted to the stairs and tried to
                        close the gap, but when he reached the ground floor, there was no sign of her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He couldn’t believe it. He took a deep breath before admitting to the others,
                        “She’s gone. I lost her. I <i class="calibre8">am</i> a total plank.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-62" class="calibre17">Moments later Paris and Kat arrived to find Rio standing
                        on his tiptoes looking for Sara among the people on the sidewalk. He was frustrated and
                        embarrassed. He’d blown his first chance as an alpha. The others were more concerned with the
                        idea that Sara was a thief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They crossed the street and sat on a park bench next to the statue of David
                        Livingstone, a famous Scottish explorer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What are we going to do?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio gave him a look. “If we tell Mother, then we have to admit we skipped
                        school and spied on her. He’ll be brassed off.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But we know she’s a thief,” he replied. “We can’t just let her join the team
                        with this mission coming up. How many different ways can that go wrong?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re right,” said Rio. “We’ve got to tell him, even if it means getting in
                        trouble.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>8. </strong>Haystacks</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Mother and Sydney were on the upper level of the
                            Scottish National Gallery admiring a painting of haystacks when Sara came up behind them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Found you,” she said with an easy smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother checked his watch and raised an eyebrow. “You were supposed to <i
                            class="calibre8">find us</i> twelve minutes ago.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She cringed. “Does that mean I failed?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No … you passed … but only just,” he said. “Remember: <i
                            class="calibre8">Bad</i> <i class="calibre8">guys never wait, so good guys can’t be
                            late.</i>”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Catchy,” said Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">Motherisms</i>,” said Sydney. “You get used to them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me guess,” Sara said, pointing at the painting. “You picked haystacks
                        because finding a rendezvous point’s like finding a needle in a haystack?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He laughed. “No, but I wish I had. You’re very clever, Sara.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not everybody likes that about me,” she said sheepishly. “In some of the
                        houses where I’ve lived, being clever was considered a bad thing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Fear not,” he replied. “We’re quite fond of cleverness on the farm. Now let’s
                        get you there so you can see for yourself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara walked toward the exit, but changed direction when she noticed Mother and
                        Sydney going the opposite way. As she hurried to catch up, she asked, “We don’t actually live on
                        a farm, do we?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre17">“That’s just what we call it,” answered Sydney. “You’ll
                        understand when we get there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother led them down a hallway of offices before stopping at an elevator marked
                        <span class="calibre7">STAFF ONLY</span>. He pressed the down button.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Is this another test?” asked Sara. “Because I don’t think we’re supposed to
                        use this elevator.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The door opened with a ding, and Mother and Sydney got in. He turned and asked,
                        “Why not?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because it’s only for employees.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pointed at an ID badge clipped to his belt. “I am an employee.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara couldn’t believe it. She stepped in and asked, “How many fake IDs do you
                        have?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve not counted, but it’s quite a lot,” Mother said with a chuckle. He pushed
                        a button, and the elevator lurched into motion. “Although this one’s legit. I really work here.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara studied his expression. “I don’t know how to tell if you’re joking or
                        not.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not,” he said. “I’m a consultant specializing in art of the
                        late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. You know that Monet painting of the haystacks?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What about it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I helped the museum acquire it last year. I’m quite proud of that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Downstairs they exited the building into a small employee parking lot and
                        headed straight for a sports car that looked like it belonged in a James Bond movie. It was
                        sleek, with tinted windows and a matte black paint job. As she walked toward it, Sara wondered
                        if it came fully loaded with secret weapons and an ejector seat. She was just about to run her
                        fingers along the body when Mother called her.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre17">“Sorry, but that’s not ours,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She turned to see that he and Sydney had stopped at an oldish Volvo station
                        wagon that looked more <i class="calibre8">mom</i> than <i class="calibre8">Bond</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Contrary to what you’ve seen at the cinema, spies have practical cars that
                        don’t attract attention,” he said. “Driving that would spoil the whole secret</i> part of
                        ‘secret agent.’ Besides, we’ve got too many people. We need more seating.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And room for groceries,” added Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent point,” said Mother. “The boys are voracious eaters.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You can have the front seat,” Sydney said, holding open the</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">passenger door. “You’ll get a better view.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Before they drove off, Mother leaned over conspiratorially and whispered,
                        “There is, however, one special feature, if you’d like to press that button.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pointed at a button on the dashboard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really?” Sara said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just make sure everyone’s got their seat belts on.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She clicked her seat belt, checked the others, and then cautiously reached for
                        the button. When she pressed it … the engine started, and Mother let out a cackle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” Sara said, grinning but a bit embarrassed. “You got</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Forget the movies,” he said. “The life of a spy is nothing like 007.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They pulled out of the gravel car park and drove north out of the city.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So in addition to being a spy you’re also a museum consultant,” she said. “Any
                        other jobs I should know about?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m caretaker of a small airfield,” he said. “It’s a little grass runway next
                        to the farm. During World War II it was an RAF base, and now it’s open a few days a week for use
                        by private planes.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre17">“And MI6 is okay with all these side jobs?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They can’t really complain,” he answered. “As far as they’re concerned, I’m
                        dead.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a curious look. “It just gets stranger and stranger with you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you’ve only scratched the surface,” Sydney chimed in from the backseat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Officially speaking, I died in that fire,” Mother explained. “I was
                        double-crossed by our own agents, none of whom know Paris rescued me. So when I contacted my
                        superior and told her what happened, my instructions were to lie low and disappear.Meanwhile,
                        she convinced French police to report that the body of an unidentified man had been found in the
                        factory. Internally at MI6, it was understood that I was that body.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That way any agents passing information to Umbra told their handlers that
                        Mother was no longer a worry,” Sydney added.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The thinking is that a dead agent can accomplish more than a living one,” said
                        Mother. “That’s why they hid me in the middle-of-nowhere Scotland. There are only a handful of
                        people inside the Service who know I’m alive, which means they can’t pay me without attracting
                        attention. The museum and airfield jobs let me earn a salary without anything leading back to
                        MI6.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do you even know anything about the art of the late- nineteenth and
                        early-twentieth centuries?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I have an MA in art history from the University of St.Andrews,” he said
                        proudly. “My cover as an agent was posing as a black-market art dealer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But what if you cross paths with someone from the art world</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">who recognizes you?” asked Sara. “Won’t they find out you’re alive?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre17">“Paris saved me from the fire,” he said. “But I was badly
                        burned and needed surgery. When they operated, they altered my appearance.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How much?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If she were alive today, my own mother wouldn’t recognize me,” he said. “And
                        sometimes I’m still a bit surprised when I look in the mirror and see who’s there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They drove north along the coast through farms and fishing villages like
                        nothing Sara had ever seen. She especially liked looking out at the dark storm clouds forming
                        over the North Sea. Finally, she asked the question that had nagged at her since Mother told her
                        about the fire.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What about your wife?” she asked cautiously. “She was one of the agents who
                        double-crossed you, right?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Clementine,” he answered. “We worked together for fifteen years and were
                        married for twelve. I have no idea how Umbra corrupted her, but they flipped her to their side
                        and she helped set me up.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He said this without emotion, but Sara knew it had to be devastating.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What happened to her?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“After the fire, she disappeared with Annie and Robert.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are they other agents?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No.” He paused for a moment. “They’re my children. Our children, I mean. Mine
                        and Clemmie’s.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You have kids?!” She said it more as an exclamation than a question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” he said. “Annie’s fourteen and Robert’s eleven.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And you don’t know where they are?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He shook his head. “No. At MI6, Clementine’s specialty was</p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre8">vanishing</i> assets.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre17">“What’s that?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Say a Russian spy flipped sides and joined forces with the British, she would
                        erase all trace of his previous existence and create an entirely new identity. There’s no one
                        better at scrubbing a trail than Clemmie. She’s certainly done a good job hiding Robert and
                        Annie. I know, because I’ve been looking.” He paused for a moment. “But no one knows her methods
                        better than I do. I will find them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Soon they reached a sign reading <span class="calibre7">WEATHER STATION</span>
                        and <span class="calibre7">AIRFIELD</span>. An arrow pointed them down a dirt road to a squat
                        air traffic control tower next to a grass landing strip. <span class="calibre7">RAF
                            AISLING</span> was painted in faded letters on the side of the tower along with the blue,
                        white, and red roundel that symbolized the Royal Air Force.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This is where you work?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And where I live,” he said. “I’ve got a little flat&mdash;an apartment
                        &mdash;in the tower.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Luckily, our home’s a bit more grand,” Sydney added with a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara laughed too when she saw what Sydney was talking about.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Just beyond the airfield was a sprawling three-story stone house overlooking
                        the sea. It had a turret on one side, and Sara wondered if it might technically be a castle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Curiously, the roof and surrounding yard were filled with scientific equipment.
                        There was a radar tower, wind turbine, antennae, and various other weather instruments. Mother
                        parked the station wagon in front of the house, and Sara noticed a sign that said <span
                            class="calibre7">THE FOUNDATION FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH AND</span> <span
                            class="calibre7">MONITORING</span>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother turned to her and smiled. “Welcome to FARM.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>9. </strong>FARM</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">The first thing that greeted</span> them inside the
                        house was a portrait of a large, jowly man with a pencil-thin mustache and thick glasses. In the
                        painting he was standing next to a globe and holding an anemometer, a device for measuring wind
                        speed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who’s this?” Sara asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The twenty-fourth baron of Aisling,” answered Sydney. “But we just call him
                        Big Bill.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It was thought that the twenty-third baron had no surviving relatives,” said
                        Mother. “But, right before he passed away, a successful industrialist and distant cousin named
                        William Maxwell was discovered living in Los Angeles. As the only heir, he inherited all of
                        this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If he inherited it, why are we here?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He didn’t want to leave sunny California for gloomy Scotland,” said Sydney.
                        “And since he was already rich, he decided to use his inheritance to create the Foundation for
                        Atmospheric Research and Monitoring. That’s how an old Scottish manor house become a
                        state-of-the-art weather station and research center.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ll have to memorize all this for the tours,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Tours?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Weather Weirdos,” Sydney said, shaking her head. “They knock on the door at
                        all hours and ask to look around.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre17">“I prefer the term ‘meteorology enthusiasts,’ ” said
                        Mother. “And we’re happy to welcome them. It’s all part of our mission as defined by the baron.
                        He thought the study of ocean and weather patterns was vitally important. The fact that this
                        house overlooks the North Sea made it an ideal location to do both.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So he turned it into a weather station, but he stayed in California?” asked
                        Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He made one visit,” Mother said. “During which he posed for this portrait and
                        cut the ribbon at the grand-opening ceremony. He also gave a rousing speech about the importance
                        of climate research long before it was fashionable.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A shame nobody heard it,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why not?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because the grand opening was held on the second of June, 1953,” said Mother.
                        “The same day as Queen Elizabeth’s coronation.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not surprisingly, most people chose to watch their new queen receive her crown
                        rather than listen to some crackpot millionaire talk about the weather,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I prefer the term ‘eccentric philanthropist,’ ” said Mother. “But, otherwise,
                        yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why didn’t he just reschedule it?” Sara asked. “He had to know no one would
                        come.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That was the intent,” answered Mother. “Fewer attendees meant fewer questions
                        and fewer chances to blow his cover. You see, the twenty-third baron of Aisling really didn’t
                        have any surviving relatives. Big Bill wasn’t a successful industrialist; rather he was a
                        small-time Hollywood actor who specialized in portraying successful industrialists. He was hired
                        by MI6 to play a role because in addition to studying the ocean, this house was perfectly
                        situated to study the Soviet Union.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-71" class="calibre17">Sara’s eyes opened wide. “I wondered how MI6 figured into
                        this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This is the part we don’t mention on the tours,” said Mother. “FARM was a
                        covert listening station throughout the Cold War.All the equipment that studied the climate was
                        specially designed to also eavesdrop on our Russian counterparts. The upstairs was >turned into
                        a dormitory able to house up to eight spies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Spies who posed as scientists working at the weather station?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Exactly,” he said. “Although it wasn’t just posturing. They spied <i
                            class="calibre8">and</i> conducted scientific research. FARM continues
                        to be a working weather station to this day. That’s the key to its cover and the reason why <i
                            class="calibre8">meteorology enthusiasts</i>”&mdash;he shot a
                        look at Sydney &mdash; “come knocking on the door. But with advancing technologies and changing
                        politics, the eavesdropping component went away. That’s when MI6 converted it into a
                        cryptography center.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But if its cover’s still as a weather station,” said Sara, “how do a bunch of
                        kids living here not ruin it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re part of the FARM Fellows Program, which engages talented but
                        disadvantaged youth from around the world and helps us become the next generation of climate
                        scientists,” Sydney said, as if reciting from a brochure. “That’s also part of the tour.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“FARM Fellows?” Sara asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just flows off the tongue, doesn’t it?” said Sydney. “At Kinloch they call us
                        the <i class="calibre8">farmers</i>, and they don’t mean it as a
                        compliment.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You may be farmers,” said a voice with a pleasant Scottish accent, “but
                        they’re just <i class="calibre8">farmadach</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara turned to see a woman in her midthirties with dark red hair down to her
                        shoulders. She wore black jeans, a thick sweater, and a pair of boots known as “Wellies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Farmadach?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre17">“It’s Scottish for jealous,” replied the woman. “They’re
                        envious because they’re stuck in that fussy old school and you get to live here with me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You must be Ms. Montgomery,” said Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Call me Monty.” She shook Sara’s hand. “It’s lovely to meet you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We were telling Sara all about Big Bill and FARM,” said Mother. “I was just
                        going to explain how&mdash;”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sounds riveting, but I’m sure it can wait,” Monty interrupted. “This poor
                        girl’s had an arduous forty-eight hours. The least we can do is let her catch her breath.” She
                        turned to Sara. “You must be knackered.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara gave her a confused look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Exhausted,” explained Monty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I hadn’t really thought about it, but yeah,” she answered. “I’m… <i
                            class="calibre8">knackered</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why don’t I show you to your room,” said Monty. “You can relax. Maybe even
                        take a short nap. I’d recommend that, actually. It helps fight the jet lag.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sounds good,” said Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But I haven’t even gotten to the part where MI6 sent Paris and me to live
                        here,” Mother said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You mean the day the circus came to town,” Monty replied with a playful laugh.
                        “As I said, it can wait.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Just beyond the portrait of Big Bill was a grand staircase, and Sara followed
                        Monty up to the second floor. “Who’s my roommate? Sydney or Kat?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Neither,” answered Monty. “Everyone has a room to themselves.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s not very big, but it’s all yours,” she said.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre17">Upstairs was a long hallway with four rooms on each end.
                        Monty pointed to the right and said, “The boys live over there, which explains the assortment of
                        odors.” She headed the other way. “You’re down here with Kat and Syd. The three of you have your
                        own loo, which you’re all responsible for keeping clean.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Got it,” said Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You also have some chores,” she added. “Nothing drastic; laundry, Hoovering,
                        that sort of thing. It’s a secret facility, so we can’t exactly hire staff to clean up.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Of course.” Sara pointed at a padlocked door. “What’s with that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Kat’s still working on some sharing issues,” Monty said. “She’s rather
                        protective of her privacy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll make sure to remember that,” said Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As they reached the end of the hall, Monty said, “And here we</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">are.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara opened the door and couldn’t believe her eyes. In spite of Monty’s warning
                        about its size, the room seemed huge to her. There was a bed along one wall, a desk and chair
                        next to the window, and a tall dresser with a mirror. Best of all was the view of the sea. It
                        was spectacular.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This is mine?” she asked, stunned.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve never had a room of my own.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You can do it up however you’d like,” said Monty. “I know Sydney got you some
                        clothes in New York, and this morning I picked up some more. Just a few basics to hold you
                        over.” She motioned to the closet where the clothes hung neatly. “Soon as we get a chance, you
                        and I can go into Edinburgh and start filling out your wardrobe. The shops there are stellar.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That sounds amazing.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-74" class="calibre17">“Now, you take a wee nap,” Monty told her. “I’ll call you
                        for dinner in a few hours. Tonight’s my night to cook, so I’m making roast beef. It’s my
                        specialty.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yum.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Everyone will be home by then, so we can do some proper introductions and
                        Mother can tell you even more about Big Bill and FARM.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Monty went to leave, but Sara took hold of her arm. “Thank you,” she said so
                        ly. “Thank you so much.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s my pleasure. We’re delighted to have you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Monty le the room, closing the door behind her, and for the first time in as
                        long as Sara could remember, she enjoyed a feeling of total peace and privacy. It felt like … <i
                            class="calibre8">home</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She opened the window, and a blast of cool salt air filled the room. The view
                        was unlike any she’d ever seen. The overcast sky blended into the dark choppy water, so there
                        was no way to tell where one ended and the other began.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s perfect,” she said to herself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sitting at the foot of her bed, she unzipped her backpack and pulled out the
                        shoebox she’d saved from her old house. The box contained photographs, a few small objects, and
                        a snow globe from the Coney Island lighthouse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The globe no longer held water, and its plastic shell had been broken and
                        pieced back together with tape now yellowed with age. It had been a present from her <i
                            class="calibre8">abuela</i>, who passed away
                        when Sara was seven, and it was Sara’s most prized possession. She momentarily li ed it out of
                        the box, as if to show it their new home, then carefully put it back before placing the box on
                        the top shelf of the closet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Next, she sat at the desk and looked through the drawers. In one there was a
                        small pad of paper and a stray computer flash drive. In another
                        she found a pencil, along with some paper clips, rubber bands, and a tube of strawberry-scented
                        lip gloss.
                        She took the paper and pencil and wrote a note. When she finished, she folded it twice and laid
                        it on the desk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Content, she sucked in another lungful of sea air and moved over to the bed,
                        where she lay down and fell into a deep and wonderful sleep.</p>

                    <h2><strong>10. </strong>The Dinner</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Dinner was doomed before the</span> roast beef even made
                        it out of the oven.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">While Sara slept in her new room, Paris, Kat, and Rio were on the train from
                        Edinburgh plotting ways to keep her off the team.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“First thing we do when we walk in the door is tell Mother the truth,” said
                        Rio. “We can’t go on a mission with someone we can’t trust.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What if he wants to give her a second chance?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Coming here <i class="calibre8">was</i> her second chance,” Rio replied. “I
                        heard Mother tell Sydney they had to get her out of jail. Who knows what kind of trouble she was
                        in back in the States. She’s a thief, not a spy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">When they reached the FARM, Sydney was looking at a Stevenson screen, a wooden
                        box with slats that sat on a pole like an oversize birdhouse and held weather instruments. She
                        was recording data in a notebook when she saw them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I thought you were going to take these readings for me while I was gone,” she
                        said, glaring at Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He mumbled some excuse, and Sydney let it drop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris noticed the car was gone. “Where’s Mother?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He went to see a cobbler,” she answered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This caught the others off guard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Paperwork for Sara,” she said. “The new girl from New York.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-77" class="calibre17">“Already?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The mission’s in a few weeks,” replied Sydney. “There’s no time to wait.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Cobblers were spies who specialized in making false documents, like birth
                        certificates and passports, necessary to create a cover identity. If Mother was having those
                        made, that meant he already considered Sara part of the team.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Did she go with him?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” said Sydney. “She’s taking a nap.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She’s in the dormitory <i class="calibre8">by herself</i>?” Rio asked,
                        dismayed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s generally how people sleep,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Good thing I padlocked my door,” Kat said under her breath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s that supposed to mean?” snapped Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nothing,” Kat said. “Just a joke.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They’d already decided not to say anything to Sydney or Monty until they’d
                        spoken to Mother. Unfortunately, he still hadn’t returned by the time they were helping with
                        dinner. That’s when Sara came into the kitchen, still a bit groggy and wearing a dark blue
                        hoodie that Monty had bought for her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That smells incredible,” she said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Ah, Sara,” said Sydney. “I was just about to come get you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sydney handled some quick introductions, and when Sara asked what she could do
                        to help, Monty told her, “You can help tomorrow, but tonight you’re the guest of honor. Just go
                        have a seat at the table.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The dining room was large, and Sara assumed the paintings on he wall were
                        portraits of the various barons and baronesses of Aisling. Thirty seconds a er she sat down, Kat
                        entered the room to set out plates.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re in my chair,” she said.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-78" class="calibre17">“I didn’t realize certain chairs belonged to specific
                        people,” said Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They do,” said Kat. “And that one’s mine.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sorry.” She pointed at the seat next to her. “How about here?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” said Kat. “That’s Rio’s.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Living in six different foster homes had taught Sara the importance of standing
                        up for herself, but also the significance of not making waves on the first day. “What about
                        there?” she asked, pointing at the seat directly across the table from her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’d be fine if you were Sydney, but you’re not Sydney, so no,” said Kat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara’s patience was running out. “Fine. Then where should I sit?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Reluctantly Kat pointed at the seat next to Sydney’s. “That’ll do, I guess.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara got up and moved to the new seat. “Nice to meet you too,” she said, her
                        snark totally lost on Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">From here, things only got worse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother got home just before the food reached the table, so Paris never got a
                        chance to talk to him alone. He didn’t know what to do. It wasn’t like he could say, <i
                            class="calibre8">Please pass the mushy
                            peas, and oh,</i> by the way, Sara’s a thief.</i> So he and the others just
                        sat quietly and waited.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sunday roast on a Friday, what a treat this is,” Mother said as he went to
                        take a bite. “I don’t know about you, but I’m Hank Marvin.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara had a perplexed look and turned to Monty. “Who’s Hank Marvin?” she
                        whispered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s not a ‘who,’ ” said Monty. “It just means he’s hungry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked even more confused until Mother explained.“Rhyming slang,” he said.
                        “Hank Marvin rhymes with starvin’, so it means
                        ‘hungry.’ ”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre17">“How is it we speak the same language, yet I don’t
                        understand about a third of what anyone’s saying?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There were some snickers across the table, and Sara instantly felt
                        self-conscious. An awkward silence was filled with the sounds of forks and knives clinking on
                        plates, so Monty tried to break the ice. “Sara, why don’t you tell us a little bit about
                        yourself?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Um, okay,” she said as she gave her chin a nervous wipe with her napkin. “I
                        was born in Puerto Rico but spent most of my life in Brooklyn. I enjoy reading and play a little
                        soccer, but my true love is computers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Football,” Rio said curtly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s that?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s another one of those words you don’t seem to know,” he said. “Its proper
                        name is football, not soccer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There was a meanness to his tone that caught Mother off guard. He shot Rio an
                        angry look, and Monty tried to salvage the conversation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I love computers too,” she said. “That’s why I joined the SIS. They have all
                        the best ones.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They do?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A er university I went straight to work as a crypto math researcher at the
                        Doughnut,” she said. “That’s a building in Cheltenham that looks like a massive doughnut and
                        houses the Government Communications Headquarters. The computers there were mind-blowing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then why’d you leave?” asked Sara.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I loved the work but hated the boys’ club.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean by that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“GCHQ is mostly staffed by men,” said Mother. “And a lot of them are
                        intimidated by women who are significantly smarter than they are.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre17">“And Monty’s pretty much smarter than everybody on the
                        planet,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Monty ignored the compliment and continued. “When MI6 converted this into a
                        cryptography station, I jumped at the chance to run it. I grew up in Edinburgh, so it was close
                        to home and far from office politics. The best of both worlds.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There was another lull in the conversation, and at this point Mother had had
                        enough. He looked at Kat, Rio, and Paris all on one side of the table. “Is there something going
                        on that I should know about?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Paris shook his head. “No.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I find that hard to believe,” said Mother. “Because we’ve got a new team
                        member who just flew across an ocean, and you’re treating her like day-old fish.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat and Rio both looked at Paris, who nodded reluctantly. “Okay, there is
                        something.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Everyone waited, but he stopped there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re on pins and needles, mate,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Go ahead,” Paris said as he nudged Rio. “Tell them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re the one who told us,” he replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I really want to apologize,” Mother said to Sara, trying to keep his temper.
                        “This behavior defies expectation. It’s like aliens have taken over their bodies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She’s a thief!” Rio blurted out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sara nicked a watch today in Edinburgh,” answered Rio. “From the jewelry
                        counter at Jenners.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s not possible!” exclaimed Sydney. “She was with us.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre17">“Was she?” asked Paris. “You saying she didn’t leave the
                        airport by herself and meet you at an RV?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, yes,” said Sydney. “But she wasn’t alone long enough to go to Jenners
                        and steal a watch.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, she was,” said Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What makes you say that?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I saw her do it,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Some trick,” said Monty. “Considering you were at school.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There was a pause before Rio answered, “Paris, Kat, and I skipped school and
                        went to Edinburgh so we could get our own first impressions.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” Monty said. “The three of you just earned a significant addition to
                        your chores list. But we’ll deal with that later.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why would you do that?” asked Mother. “Why would you go into Edinburgh to spy
                        on her?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because dinners like this are so awkward,” Rio said. “We wanted to have an
                        unfiltered view of her, and we got one. I saw her try on watches and then when the saleswoman
                        looked the other way, she put one in her backpack.” He looked directly at Sara. “Go ahead. Tell
                        them I’m lying.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do it,” said Sydney. “Tell them it’s all rubbish.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked across the table at them and took a deep breath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Then she looked at Mother, and it seemed like she was on the verge of tears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sara?” he asked, not wanting to believe it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She dug into the kangaroo pocket of her hoodie and pulled out the box from
                        Jenners, which she placed on the table in front of Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Here,” she said. “I wanted to get you a present. For helping me so much.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother was dumbfounded. “I’m sorry. I don’t understand.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-82" class="calibre17">“Open it,” she replied. “I think you’ll like it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">That’s when he remembered the watch in the courtroom. They’d talked about him
                        getting a new one, a posh one. “Sara, you have seriously misinterpreted what we’re all about,”
                        he said. “You shouldn’t have stolen a watch for me. We don’t break the law like that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She closed her eyes for a second and said, “Please, just open it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Everyone was quiet as Mother picked up the box and opened it. Instead of a
                        watch, he found a folded piece of paper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Read the note,” Sara said. “Out loud, to everyone.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Utterly confused, Mother unfolded the paper and began reading. “ ‘I’m sorry to
                        have done this, but I had to prove to the others that I was up to the challenge. No matter what
                        you and Sydney told them, they would’ve had their doubts about me. I needed to show them without
                        your help what I could do. This is the reason I was twelve minutes late. By the way, you still
                        need a new watch.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He looked up at her. “I’m sorry, but I’m baffled.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Monty started to laugh. “That’s bloody brilliant,” she said. “I love it!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Her reaction only confused the others more.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Where’s the watch?” asked Rio. “What’d you do with it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I didn’t steal a watch,” Sara answered, flashing him a look. “I’m no thief.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I saw it with my own eyes,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” she said. “You saw what I wanted you to see. You saw me steal an empty
                        box.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Now Mother started to smile. “That’s impressive,” he said, piecing it together,
                        his voice barely able to contain his glee.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s impressive?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre17">“You fell for the nugget,” Mother said. “In the middle of
                        an RV test, fresh off the plane with absolutely no training, she set out a nugget, and you fell
                        for it. Go ahead, Sara, tell them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay, at first I just thought they were part of the test,” she said. “I
                        thought they were there to make sure I didn’t mess up.” She looked right at Paris. “Sydney
                        showed me some pictures of you all when we were on the plane, so I recognized you when I saw you
                        at the airport. You were trying to blend in with that school group, except they all had matching
                        sweatshirts and you didn’t.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me show you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She pulled out her phone and showed everyone a picture she’d snapped of Paris
                        when she was pretending to read directions. “Look at their sweatshirts,” she said. “They’re blue
                        with that logo, but you’re in an overcoat. That’s how I first noticed you. Then you followed me
                        out toward the bus.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You let her take your picture?” Rio said in disbelief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I got yours, too,” she said. She flipped through the images on her phone.
                        “Here you are on Princes Street. I spotted you in the reflection of the shop window.” She
                        flipped to another picture. “And here you are in Jenners.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio slumped in his chair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s when I had the idea about shoplifting. I knew you couldn’t follow me
                        into the women’s department without standing out, so I went there to buy myself a little time.
                        When I saw the jewelry display case, I knew what I had to do. I told the saleswoman that I
                        needed a box to wrap my mother’s birthday present. I even offered to pay for it, because,
                        despite what you think, I don’t steal things. She said she had plenty and gave me one. I put it
                        in my backpack when she was looking the other way so you’d think I’d stolen it.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre17">Kat looked at Rio and then Paris, shaking her head with
                        disappointment. “I would like to point out that I’m the only one she didn’t get a picture of.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” said Sara. “But I saw you in the coffee shop in the airport.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You lot are pathetic,” Sydney said to them. “First you’re pathetic because you
                        spied on her. Then you’re pathetic because she <i class="calibre8">saw</i> you spy on her. Who
                        was the alpha of this little catastrophe?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat and Paris both looked at Rio, who reluctantly raised a</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">finger.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Should’ve guessed,” Sydney said. “You’re always asking, ‘How come I never get
                        to call the shots?’ Well, here’s your answer. Good thing Sara’s not Umbra or the three of you’d
                        be dead.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There was quiet around the table as everyone considered what had happened.
                        Paris and Kat looked embarrassed, but Rio was devastated. He knew that he’d take the brunt of
                        the blame because he’d been in charge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I wasn’t trying to embarrass anyone,” Sara said. “I was just trying to prove
                        something.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What was that?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That I can do this,” she said. “There’s a mission coming up in three weeks. I
                        don’t know what it is, but I know I want to be a part of it. I want to fill in for Charlotte.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This caught everyone by surprise.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You told her about Charlotte?” Rio asked Sydney. “On a plane where someone
                        could overhear you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know better than that,” said Sydney. “I didn’t say a word.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nobody told me anything,” said Sara. “I figured it out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How could you?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-85" class="calibre17">Sara reached into her pocket again and pulled out two
                        items: the lip gloss and the flash drive. “I found these in my room,” she said. “The lip gloss
                        is new, so it seems like a solid guess that a girl’s been living there recently.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother and Monty shared a look, impressed by her reasoning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Before I came down here, I checked our bathroom&mdash;sorry, I mean <i
                            class="calibre8">loo</i>,” Sara continued, with a glance at Rio. “And
                        there were three different shampoos on the shelf, which seemed odd considering there were only
                        two different girls using that bathroom. Someone had used a marker to label one of the shampoos
                        ‘C-H-A-R-period.’ That could be short for Charlene, but that doesn’t make sense because everyone
                        takes a city as their name, and to my knowledge there is no city called Charlene. There is,
                        however, a city in the United States called Charlotte.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">By now, she had the rapt attention of everyone at the table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Which brings me to this.” She held up the drive. “It looks like a normal flash
                        drive, but it’s not. It’s actually a nasty little device called a <i
                            class="calibre8">keylogger</i>. It copies everything someone types
                        on a computer. It’s basic gear for a hacker.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She put it back on the table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So this is what I know. Very recently an American girl who’s a hacker was
                        living here, while you were planning a big mission that’s taking place in three weeks. But now
                        she’s gone, and you came and got me, an American girl who’s also a hacker. I figure you planned
                        the mission with her in mind, and, now that she’s out of the picture, you need me to take her
                        place.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara looked at the others, trying to read their expressions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Or am I wrong?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” said Mother. “You’re not wrong … not at all.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sara smiled. “And if there are only three weeks left, that doesn’t leave me a
                        lot of time to get up to speed. So, I did all this to show you that I
                        <i class="calibre8">can</i> do all this. I can learn fast. I can be a valuable part of the
                        team.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wow,” said Paris. “That’s stunning.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Isn’t it?” said Monty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother looked at her, his mind at work figuring out his next step. “You really
                        know how to make a first impression, Sara.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Thank you,” she said. “But, if you don’t mind, I think I’d like it better if
                        everyone started calling me Brooklyn.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>11. </strong>Sydney</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre8">Sydney, Australia&mdash;Three Years Earlier</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Counting the layover in Hong</span> Kong, it took Mother
                        twenty-three hours to fly from London to Sydney. And, as if the jet lag wasn’t disorienting
                        enough, in crossing the equator he’d gone from winter to summer. So it wasn’t surprising that he
                        was off his game when he arrived at the Wallangarra School for Girls.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Wallangarra was the fourteenth different boarding school he’d visited in the
                        three days since he’d landed, and they were all beginning to blur together. To clear his mind,
                        he looked into the< rearview mirror of his rental car and recited one of his own Motherisms. <i
                            class="calibre8">“You don’t need any hocus-pocus. All you need to
                            do is</i> focus</i>.<i class="calibre8">”</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre17">That did the trick, and a er wiping the sweat from his forehead, he was ready
                        to go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Good afternoon,” he said with a flawless Australian accent to the receptionist
                        in the main office. “I’d like to speak to …” He checked a name in a thin spiral notebook. “… Ms.
                        Madeline Cooper. I believe she’s the head of the school.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s <i class="calibre8">Dr.</i> Cooper,” the woman corrected with a raised
                        eyebrow. “May I ask what this is in reference to?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Police business, I’m afraid.” He flashed an Australian Federal Police badge
                        and said, “I’m Detective Sergeant Nicholas Henderson with the AFP.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre17">Her tone changed instantly. “Of course, Detective,” she
                        said respectfully. “Please have a seat, and I’ll let her know you’re here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother had come to Australia on short notice after receiving word that a woman
                        resembling his wife had been photographed at Sydney Airport. She’d arrived on a flight from
                        Kuala Lumpur only to leave seventeen hours later for Manila. She wasn’t detained, because the
                        facial recognition so ware only scored her as a 31 percent match: possible but unlikely.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother, however, knew it was her the instant he saw the video. She’d altered
                        her appearance with makeup and possibly surgery, but she couldn’t hide her mannerisms. He
                        recognized the way she adjusted her glasses and her tendency to hold each hand in a fist, a
                        habit she developed as a child to keep from biting her nails.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">MI6 sent agents to Kuala Lumpur and Manila in hopes of picking up her trail,
                        but Mother focused on her midway destination. She was in Australia too long for it to be a
                        layover, but not long enough to really do anything. <i class="calibre8">What if that’s where
                            she hid</i> the children?</i> he wondered. <i class="calibre8">What if
                            she went to Sydney to check on</i> Robert and Annie?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Detective Sergeant Henderson, is it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother looked up and saw an impeccably dressed woman in a dark blue pinstripe
                        suit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You must be Dr. Cooper.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She led him to her office, which was impressive though not at all welcoming.
                        There was a formal sitting area with a couch and two stiff-backed chairs around an antique
                        coffee table. The walls were covered with pictures of smiling students in blue-and-yellow
                        blazers with matching boater hats.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a lovely campus.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re proud of it,” she said. “Wallangarra girls have been going on to great
                        things ever since Mrs. Hobart founded the school in 1901.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre17">“And I see that you were one of them.” He pointed to a
                        picture on the wall. It was Dr. Cooper when she was a teenaged student at the school.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Very good eye,” she said, impressed. “No wonder you’re a detective. Now, what
                        brings you here today?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Two missing children.” He made sure to sound like a hardened police officer
                        and not a desperate father. “We have reason to believe they enrolled in area boarding schools
                        sometime in the past eighteen months and wondered if the girl ended up here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He handed her a picture of his daughter and son.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Pretty girl,” she said. “But I’m afraid she’s not one of ours.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re certain? The photo’s two years old.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We have six hundred forty-seven girls at Wallangarra,” she replied. “And I
                        know each one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Maybe she didn’t enroll but visited as a prospective student. Is there someone
                        else she might have spoken to? Someone who might’ve given her a tour?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I insist on meeting all candidates myself,” she said. “If she was here, I
                        would’ve seen her.” She handed the picture back to him. “Sorry.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Even though it had been a long shot, Mother’s heart still sank at the news.
                        There were only three more schools to check. A once-promising lead looked more and more like a
                        dead end.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Thank you for your time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Always a pleasure to help the AFP,” she said. “If you’d like, I can send the
                        picture around to other schools. It would save you the trouble of going to each one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, thank you,” he said. “It’s sensitive, and we want to control the flow of
                        information.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, good luck, then.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre17">They were interrupted by an explosion that was so
                        unexpected, Mother initially thought his ears were playing tricks on him. Then came the scream,
                        and he knew it was real.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The originator of the scream was a teacher standing in the quad in the middle
                        of campus. She had a stunned expression and held her hand over her mouth when Mother rushed onto
                        the scene with Dr. Cooper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Heaven’s sake, Alice, what happened?” Dr. Cooper asked anxiously.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s Mrs. Hobart!” shrieked the teacher. “Look what they’ve done to her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">In the center of the quad stood a bronze statue of the school’s founder. Or
                        rather, stood <i class="calibre8">most</i> of a bronze statue of the
                        school’s founder. The statue’s head had apparently been blown off in the explosion and now sat
                        upside down in a nearby flower bed. There was still some residual smoke emanating from Mrs.
                        Hobart’s neck.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The aura of effortless perfection that Dr. Cooper had conveyed up until that
                        point began to falter. Her left eye started twitching, and crimson blotches formed on her neck
                        and cheeks. “That girl,” she muttered. “That foul, wretched girl!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She trembled and seemed on the verge of erupting when she was struck by
                        inspiration.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wait a moment!” she exclaimed. “This. Is. Perfect.” She turned to Mother.
                        “Look at the damage. Someone could’ve been injured. Someone could’ve been killed. And you’re a
                        witness. This is now a police matter.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What are you talking about?” he asked, utterly confused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re coming with me,” she said to him. Then she turned to the teacher. “Go
                        get her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who?” asked the woman.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You know who,” sneered Dr. Cooper.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-91" class="calibre17">They returned to her office, and while Mother tried to
                        figure out what was happening, Dr. Cooper riffled through a filing cabinet, mumbling to herself.
                        She was possessed, but with what, he wasn’t sure.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Look at this,” she said, pulling out a thick file. “I’ve documented everything
                        she’s done.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Just then the door flew open, and Mother laid eyes on Sydney for the very first
                        time. Only, she wasn’t Sydney yet. At that moment she was still Olivia. She plopped down on the
                        couch, put her feet up on the antique coffee table, and took off her school hat</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">to reveal a short, cropped purple Mohawk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hello, Madeline,” she said with a grin. “What seems to be the problem?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You know what the problem is,” snapped the principal. “You desecrated the
                        statue of Mrs. Hobart, and you’re going to pay for it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” the girl said with total innocence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just like you don’t know who took my car apart and reassembled it in the
                        library,” said the principal. “Or like you don’t know who let a swarm of frogs loose in the
                        chapel.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“An <i class="calibre8">army</i>,” said Olivia.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” asked Dr. Cooper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A group of frogs is called an army, not a swarm,” Olivia answered with a smug
                        smile. “We learned that in Ms. Helton’s biology class.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Aren’t you clever?” the principal said as she swiped Olivia’s eet off the
                        table. “Well, this time you were too clever for your own good. You made the mistake of breaking
                        the law with <i class="calibre8">him</i>
                        here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She pointed to Mother.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-92" class="calibre17">“And who are you?” Olivia asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He’s a detective with the AFP,” Cooper answered for him. She turned to Mother.
                        “Go ahead! Show her your badge.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother was reluctant to be pulled into the dispute but didn’t see a way out, so
                        he showed his badge to Olivia.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nice to meet you, Detective Sergeant Nicholas Henderson,” she said as she
                        examined it. “How do you fit into this little drama?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s a good question,” answered Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He’s going to arrest you,” said Cooper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He was too cool to show it, but this was when Mother began to panic. Posing as
                        a police officer was one thing, but faking an arrest was something totally different. He’d come
                        to Australia on his own without notifying MI6 or local authorities.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s not really my area,” he said, trying to talk his way out of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Aren’t you with the AFP?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Of course,” he said cautiously.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, she just exploded a bomb in the middle of a school. How can that not be
                        your area?” She shoved the file into his hands. “Look at this. It documents everything she’s
                        done.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">“Allegedly,”</i> Olivia corrected. “Things that I’ve
                        allegedly done.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Cooper glared at Mother, who pretended to look through the file while his mind
                        raced, trying to come up with an escape strategy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Either you arrest her,” she demanded, “or you stay with her until I have the
                        local police come down here. Then you can explain your reluctance to them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Involving the actual police was the last thing that he wanted. They didn’t take
                        kindly to people pretending to be officers of the law.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre17">“No, no, there won’t be any need for that,” he said. “I’ll
                        take her in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rather than protest, Olivia smiled. She even held her hands up for him and
                        asked, “Want to cuff me?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There won’t be any need for that,” he said. “I doubt you’re a flight risk.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Don’t be so sure,” said Cooper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother desperately wanted out of the situation but couldn’t figure out how to
                        do it without taking the girl. “Come on,” he said reluctantly. “Let’s get you down to the
                        station.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The principal gleefully escorted them to the door as Olivia followed Mother to
                        his car.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You want me in the backseat or front?” Olivia asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Front’s fine,” he said as he opened the door for her. No matter how long he
                        tried to stall, inspiration failed to come. A few minutes later he was driving past the guard
                        gate, furious at himself for getting into this situation. He was still trying to think of what
                        to do when Olivia broke the silence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, DS Henderson, this is quite the pickle,” she said as they drove away
                        from campus.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How do you mean?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Me being in your custody,” she answered, “and you not actually being a police
                        officer.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother gave her a look. “What makes you think I’m not a police officer?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“First of all, the badge you flashed is out-of-date,” she continued. “The AFP
                        switched the crown about three years ago. It’s not something Dr. Cooper would notice, but then
                        again she’s never been arrested.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Unlike you, I suppose,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre17">“Let’s just say, it’s not my first time in a police car.”
                        She smiled. “Of course, this isn’t really a police car.” She pointed at a sticker inside the
                        windshield. “It was rented at Sydney Airport. That was giveaway number two.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She let him stew for a moment before continuing. “Don’t worry about it, though.
                        I’m not going to blow your cover. Just head for the beach. I know some people who will take me
                        in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Your family?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Hardly,” she laughed. “Mum’s dead and Dad’s, well, I have no idea where Dad
                        is, but I know he’s not waiting somewhere to welcome me with open arms.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If you don’t have a family, how can you afford to go to a fancy school like
                        that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It was stipulated in my grandmother’s will,” she said. “She was a Wallangarra
                        girl and hoped I would follow in her footsteps. It’s probably best that she’s no longer with us
                        or all of this might have killed her.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Despite the situation, Mother couldn’t help but like Olivia. She was fresh and
                        honest. As they drove down Pacific Highway, he said, “I have a question for you. Why?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Dr. Cooper’s car in the library? An army of frogs in the chapel? The headless
                        Mrs. Hobart?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Oh, you mean my alleged wrongdoings,” she said. “There’s no way I’m confessing
                        any of that to a copper. Even a pretend one.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I can’t tell anyone without getting myself into much bigger trouble than you,”
                        he said. “Besides, we’re not talking random mischief here. These were very intentional acts, and
                        I’m guessing they were meant to convey specific messages.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s the drawback with being an anonymous vigilante for justice,” she
                        admitted. “You don’t get to explain your intentions, and sometimes
                        the general public misses your true artistry.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre17">“Explain them to me,” he said. “I’m fascinated.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well … if you’re <i class="calibre8">fascinated</i>,” she said. “Let’s start
                        with Ruby Carlisle.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who’s she?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A girl in year eight,” she responded. “She’s got the voice of an angel, and
                        she auditioned for the school musical. They were doing <i class="calibre8">The Frog
                            Princess</i>. She was amazing, a shoo-in for the
                        lead role. But, when the cast was announced, Ruby didn’t have the lead, or a supporting role, or
                        even a single solo. She was at the bottom of the list in the chorus. Now, there’s nothing wrong
                        with singing in the chorus, but everyone knew she should’ve been top of the cast. Even the girl
                        who got the part thought it should’ve gone to Ruby.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why didn’t she get it?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Dr. Cooper didn’t think she ‘had the right look’ for such a prominent role.
                        She actually said that. Then Cooper makes it worse and tells her, ‘Maybe if you had fewer
                        desserts you’d be more princess and less frog.’ Un-freaking-believable.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And your response?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I got on the phone and impersonated Ms. Helton,” she said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She’s the biology teacher you mentioned,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Very good,” she said, impressed. “I called the company that provides specimens
                        for our lab projects and ordered fifty bumpy spotted frogs. Then I let them loose in the school
                        chapel.” She laughed at the memory. “It was like one of the plagues of Egypt in there.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What about taking her car apart and putting it back together in the library?”
                        he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That was in response to Dr. Cooper canceling the Robotics and Engineering Club
                        and then using the money to create a school pageant,” she said, shaking her head. “A bloody
                        beauty pageant with girls in
                        sportswear answering questions about saving the planet. I was beyond livid. So, I did my little
                        car trick
                        and put a note on the windshield that said, ‘Bet you’d like an engineer now, wouldn’t you?’ ”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother laughed at this. “And the decapitated Mrs. Hobart?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“My masterpiece, if I say so myself,” she said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Inspired by?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The school’s systematic mistreatment of aboriginal students,” she replied.
                        “We’ve got a handful of girls who come from indigenous tribes. Not that you’d ever see one in a
                        brochure or in a picture on the wall in her office. And every time these girls try to do
                        something that embraces their culture, like sponsor a native dance demonstration or celebrate
                        Harmony Day, Dr. Cooper stops it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because, beloved Mrs. Hobart, founder of the school, was a notoriously racist
                        cow. Amazingly ironic considering she named the school Wallangarra, which is an aboriginal
                        word.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They drove in silence for a moment while he considered her reasons.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Out of curiosity,” he said, “did you audition for the musical?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No. I sing like a duck.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Were you in the Robotics and Engineering Club?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Also no.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are you a member of an indigenous tribe?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” she said. “But you don’t have to be part of a group to understand that
                        they’re being mistreated.” She paused before adding, “Justice doesn’t require a membership card.
                        Just a sense of right and wrong.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">That’s when he knew. He’d failed in his search for his children, but he’d
                        unexpectedly found another spy. They rode in silence together, the
                        sound of the tires thumping on the road.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre17">“Now it’s your turn,” she said. “Why are you pretending to
                        be from the AFP?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He smiled. “Funny you should ask. First, though, I’ve got one more question.
                        What do you think of Scotland?”</p>

                    <h2><strong>12. </strong>Basic Training</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre8">Aisling, Scotland&mdash;Present Day</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">The purple mohawk was long</span> gone, but Sydney still
                        felt like the same person who’d tormented the faculty at Wallangarra. Being a troublemaker had
                        been fun, but she’d never done it for the sake of being difficult. It was always about justice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">At Wallangarra, fighting injustice meant battling Dr. Cooper. But now MI6 let
                        her fight on a much larger scale. Even better, it had given her teammates to fight alongside,
                        and it was time to train a new one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She shivered from the cold as she climbed out of bed. That was one of the
                        problems with centuries-old Scottish manor houses. They were designed to repel attacking armies,
                        not to keep you warm and cozy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">After putting on running tights, a long-sleeve T-shirt, gloves, and a hoodie,
                        she crossed the hall to Brooklyn’s room and gave the door three hard thwacks with the bottom of
                        her fist. “Wake up,sleepyhead.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">When there was no response, she tried again, this time pounding louder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">Thwack, thwack, thwack!</i> “Yo, Brookie the Rookie! Time
                        to get up!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“All right, all right,” Brooklyn called back. “Come in and stop that banging.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre17">Sydney didn’t enter the room so much as she invaded it,
                        flinging the door open and flipping on all the lights. Brooklyn used her forearm to shield
                        herself from their bright glare as she sat up and got her bearings.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It wasn’t a dream,” Sydney said firmly. “You really are in Scotland learning
                        how to be a spy. Welcome to basic training!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn rubbed her eyes and tried to focus on the clock next to her bed. “It’s
                        four fifty in the morning.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know,” said Sydney. “It’s your first day, so I thought I’d let you sleep
                        in.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do you realize that back home in New York it’s …” She tried to do the
                        time-zone math in her head but gave up and said, “…<i class="calibre8">yesterday</i>?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“First of all, New York isn’t home anymore, so you’re going to have to get used
                        to that. Second, you need to ask yourself something. Are you Sara? Or are you Brooklyn? Because
                        Sara can go back to sleep, but Brooklyn needs to be downstairs ready to run in ten minutes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">That woke her up faster than a bucket of cold water.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll be there in five,” Brooklyn said, now fully alert.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Dress warmly,” Sydney instructed as she le the room. “The sun doesn’t come up
                        for another hour, and it’s cold along the water.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The previous night Brooklyn had demonstrated impressive natural spy skills, but
                        if she wanted to be ready for a high-level operation in three weeks, she needed to prepare
                        around the clock. It was decided that she wouldn’t enroll at Kinloch until after the mission so
                        she could dedicate herself to getting ready full-time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Her training schedule was split up with everyone spearheading a different
                        aspect. Sydney took charge of physical conditioning, which is why
                        early Saturday morning the two of them ran on the beach in near total darkness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re going to start every day this way,” Sydney said as the first glimmers of
                        daylight began to peek out from the horizon. “We have to build up your stamina. Missions rarely
                        follow a schedule, and you need to stay alert despite limited rest.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The ocean breeze was cold against their faces, and their strides fell into a
                        steady matching rhythm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What was that you called me earlier?” Brooklyn asked. “When you were pounding
                        on my door.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brookie the Rookie,” she said with a laugh. “We came up with that last night
                        when we were planning your day. I don’t remember if it was Paris or Rio who thought of it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They hate me, don’t they?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They’re embarrassed, but they’ll get over it,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m not so sure,” said Brooklyn. “I got angry eyes from Rio all through
                        dinner, and as far as Kat goes, you should’ve seen her when I sat in her chair.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s got nothing to do with you,” said Sydney. “That’s just Kat.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She’s one of a kind,” said Sydney. “And I mean that in the best possible way.
                        It’s what makes her amazing. She sees the world in patterns and equations. That’s why she’s such
                        a stellar code breaker. But, if something’s out of order, like a person in the wrong seat, it
                        knocks her for a stagger.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">After a few more strides Brooklyn said, “Thanks, by the way.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You never believed that I’d stolen anything. You totally had my back.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre17">In a day filled with improbable twists and turns, that
                        moment stood out for Brooklyn. It meant more to her than Sydney would ever know because it felt
                        like something a sister would do. Neither f them spoke for a while until Brooklyn asked, “How
                        far are we going to run?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I figured we’d go until you threw up. Maybe a little farther than that. This
                        isn’t just exercise, we need to get you in spy shape.” Sydney laughed and started running
                        faster. Brooklyn took a deep breath and tried to keep up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Attempting to keep up with her teammates was a recurring theme throughout
                        Brooklyn’s day. She got completely lost in the woods when Paris tried to teach her how to
                        navigate with a compass. Though she took it as a good sign that he came back to rescue her. She
                        was fairly certain Rio would’ve let her wander for hours.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She did her best to keep pace mentally when Kat tried to explain complex
                        theories on patterns and codes using a Scrabble game. Most of it was beyond her grasp, and she
                        couldn’t tell how much of that was because it was hard, how much was because Kat didn’t like
                        her, and how much was the result of Kat’s social awkwardness. Ultimately, she decided it was
                        probably a bit of each.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">But the most difficult lesson was the last one. At least from a confrontational
                        standpoint. It was with Rio, who held the biggest grudge from the day before. She tried to
                        lighten the mood with a friendly smile when they sat down at the kitchen table, but there was no
                        smile in return.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What am I going to learn from you?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I don’t know that there’s anything I can teach you,” he said mockingly. “I
                        thought you already knew it all.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre17">Brooklyn was not in the mood. She let out a deep sigh and
                        asked, “Do you want me to leave?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” he said. “I want you to keep up.” He flashed a sly grin. “If you can.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He placed three plastic cups and a red foam ball on the table between them.
                        “I’m going to place the ball under a cup, and then I’m going to shuffle them around. When I
                        stop, tell me where you think it is.” He did the trick three times in a row and each time, when
                        she missed, he made an obnoxious buzzer noise and said, “Wrong!” After the third time, he added,
                        “Maybe cups aren’t your thing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Next, he did a variation of the same trick except with three playing cards.
                        Again, she missed, getting the answer wrong three times in a row.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Boy, you’re not very good at this, are you?” he taunted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m done,” Brooklyn said, starting to get up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s the matter?” asked Rio. “You don’t like it when someone makes you look
                        foolish?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” she said. “I don’t.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then how do you think it made me feel?” he said. “You have any idea how long
                        I’ve waited for a chance to be the alpha? And you humiliated me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” she said. “You humiliated yourself. I didn’t ask you to spy on me. You
                        chose that. Think about it. What do you thin would’ve happened if, instead of spying, you just
                        greeted me at the airport? If you made me feel like you were at least open to giving me a
                        chance? You looked bad because you wanted me to look bad.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They both sat quietly for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Now, what’s the lesson?” she asked.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">This</i> is the lesson,” he said,
                        motioning to the cards and cups on the table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Magic tricks?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They use confidence, deception, and audience manipulation. Just like
                        spycraft,” he said. “The CIA even hired one of Harry Houdini’s best friends to teach magic to
                        its agents.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re making that up,” she said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s completely true.” Rio pulled out a copy of <i class="calibre8">The
                            Official C.I.A.</i> <i class="calibre8">Manual of Trickery and Deception</i> and placed it
                        in front
                        of her. “His name was John Mulholland, and this is the handbook he wrote.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She flipped through some of the pages. “And you learned magic by reading this
                        book?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, I’ve been doing magic my whole life,” he said. “In Brazil I lived on the
                        streets and made a living performing tricks for tourists. After my act, I’d pass around a hat,
                        and they’d put money in it. One day, Mother was in the crowd.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And instead of putting money in the hat, he asked if you wanted to go to
                        Scotland?” guessed Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Something like that,” he said, looking at the table. There was an awkward
                        pause before he added, “And when I got here, there was no one to welcome me at the airport
                        either.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s too bad,” said Brooklyn. “It would’ve been nice.” She paused for a bit
                        and added, “And it’s too bad how things went down yesterday. I really didn’t mean to embarrass
                        you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He gave a slight nod. “Right.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So … can you teach me some tricks?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He spent the next hour demonstrating basic skills like palming a playing card
                        or performing the French Drop, a maneuver in which a small object seemingly disappears when
                        passing from one hand to the
                        other. More important, he explained how these tricks translated directly into spy work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“If you can palm the ace of spades, then you can palm a flash drive or a piece
                        of paper with a secret message on it,” he said. “And if you can do the French Drop, you can
                        convince someone that your hands are empty when they’re not. These skills can mean the
                        difference between the success or failure of a mission.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The last thing he showed her was the brush pass.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This is how a spy passes something to another spy without anyone seeing,” he
                        said. “You act like you don’t notice each other, avoid all eye contact, and when you brush past,
                        you slip the object into the other person’s hand or pocket.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They were practicing the move when Monty came into the kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How’s it going?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Good,” said Rio. “Just working on the brush pass.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I need to steal Brooklyn,” she said. “I want her to meet Ben before the
                        briefing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who’s Ben?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The last member of the team,” answered Monty. “He’s down in the priest hole.
                        That’s where Mother’s going to brief everyone on the mission.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn gave her a quizzical look. “What’s a priest hole?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Follow me and I’ll explain.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Monty led Brooklyn down a narrow staircase that connected the kitchen with the
                        basement. “Many of the castles and manor houses across Scotland and England have priest holes,”
                        she said. “They’re secret rooms where someone can hide.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And why are they called that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because a lot of the time, the person hiding was a priest or a minister,” she
                        explained. “Religious conflict has been a common theme throughout
                        this part of the world for centuries. And there have been times where if you were Catholic and
                        your priest
                        was visiting, the last thing you’d want was for the authorities to find him here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So he’d hide down below?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Exactly.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">In the basement they entered a library that had floor-to-ceiling bookcases on
                        each wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And this is it?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” said Monty. “This would be too easy to find.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She reached behind a book, flipped a switch, and pulled on a bookcase, which
                        swiveled out to reveal a steel door with a keypad. “The priest hole’s back here,” she said as
                        she typed in a combination. “Of course, it used to be rather small, but then MI6 expanded it and
                        added some new features.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This was an understatement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The door swung open to reveal a room roughly twenty by twenty with high-tech
                        gear everywhere. There were computers, a virtual reality station, and giant touch-screen
                        monitors on two of the walls. Unlike the rest of what she’d seen at the FARM, this actually
                        looked like it belonged in a spy movie. There weren’t, however, any people.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I thought you said we were going to meet someone named</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Ben,” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not some<i class="calibre8">one</i>, some<i class="calibre8">thing</i>,”
                        answered Monty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They stepped inside, and Brooklyn’s eyes were instantly drawn to a
                        supercomputer running the length of the room behind a wall of glass panels. It was made up of
                        ten silver units standing side by side like a row of refrigerators, each about six feet tall and
                        two feet wide.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brooklyn,” Monty said as they approached it, “<i class="calibre8">this</i> is
                        Ben.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre17">Brooklyn had never seen anything so beautiful in all her
                        life. She pressed her hand up against the glass, which was cool to the touch. “It’s very nice to
                        meet you,” she said. “I think we’re going to become excellent friends.”</p>

                    <h2><strong>13. </strong>Operation Willy Wonka</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">For Brooklyn, it was love</span> at first sight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As a student at PS 394, she’d become a skilled hacker despite only having
                        access to some ancient PCs in the school’s computer lab. But now, with Ben, the possibilities of
                        what she could do were limitless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Mind if I talk Geek for a minute?” asked Monty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Are you kidding?” answered Brooklyn, who stood virtually motionless,
                        mesmerized by the machine. “I’d love that.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Ben started off as a Cray XC40 supercomputer with a two-point-one gigahertz
                        Xeon processor,” Monty explained. “As far as the rest of the world knows, that’s what FARM had
                        installed to create state-of-the-art weather forecasting models. Luckily for me, the same type
                        of computer that’s used for predicting the path of a hurricane is ideal for advanced
                        cryptography. MI6 doubled the number of racks from five to ten, made some modifications to the
                        operating system, and added a few next-generation technology touches so that now it can perform
                        more than five hundred trillion floating-point operations per second. Unofficially, it’s the
                        sixteenth-fastest computer in Britain.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why unofficially?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because not too many people know it’s here,” said Monty. “And almost nobody
                        knows about the modifications.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And it’s ours?” Brooklyn asked.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre17">“Technically it belongs to the people of the United
                        Kingdom. But, since they’re unaware of its existence, we get to have all the fun.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why do you call it Ben? Do the letters stand for something?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s just a name,” said Monty. “I thought it was a bit daunting to always call
                        it ‘the supercomputer.’ And since it’s a weather-forecasting machine that we’ve hidden in a
                        priest hole, it seemed right to name it a er an actual weather-forecasting priest.” Monty
                        pointed to a brown-tinted photo on the wall of a man with a hooknose and wire-framed glasses.
                        “That’s Father Benito Viñes, a Spanish-born priest who moved to Cuba in 1870. He was the first
                        person to successfully predict the paths of tropical storms, which saved countless lives. He was
                        known throughout the Caribbean as Father Hurricane.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn smiled at the man in the picture. <i class="calibre8">“Buenas tardes,
                            Padre</i> Huracán.”</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For her every bit of it was perfect, especially Monty, who was the first woman
                        she’d ever met who had the same level of excitement that she did while discussing technology.
                        They continued their geek talk until the others arrived for the briefing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Everyone sat around a large oval conference table, and, trying not to upset
                        Kat, Brooklyn waited until the others had taken their seats to make sure she didn’t sit in the
                        wrong one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you think of Ben?” Mother asked her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He’s amazing,” she said, beaming.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent,” he replied. “The good news is you’re going to spend a lot of time
                        with him during the next few weeks.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Excellent,” said Brooklyn. “What’s the bad news?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Even with Ben working at top capacity, it’s going to be hard to be fully
                        prepared for this operation,” he replied.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre17">This brought a smile to Sydney’s face. “But, if we need
                        to get prepared, that means we have a mission,” she said hopefully. “Did we get official
                        approval?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” Mother answered, eliciting enthusiastic reactions from around the table.
                        “I just got off the phone with Vauxhall Cross.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sydney leaned over and whispered to Brooklyn, “That’s MI6 headquarters.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I told them about Brooklyn and our faith in her,” continued Mother. “We also
                        discussed our unique position with regard to the current situation, and we were given the
                        all-clear to implement Operation Willy Wonka.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn laughed. “You really do love Roald Dahl books, don’t you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I really do,” replied Mother. “But in this instance I think you’ll find the
                        name’s particularly appropriate.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pressed a button on a clicker, and half a dozen pictures filled the wall
                        monitors. Although most of the photos had been taken from a distance, Brooklyn could tell that
                        they were all of the same man. Only one, however, provided a good look at his face. It was a
                        publicity shot that she’d seen in countless tech magazines.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Stavros Sinclair?” she said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You know him?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“In the computer world he’s pretty much a god,” answered Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He’s founder and CEO of Sinclair Scientifica, a mammoth multinational
                        technology company that makes everything from microchips to missiles,” said Mother. “He’s one of
                        the richest men in the world and also one of the most secretive. These are the only known recent
                        photos of him, and they’re not really that recent.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me guess,” said Brooklyn. “He’s Willy Wonka.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre17">“Bang on,” answered Mother. “He hasn’t made a public
                        appearance in more than four years, but in a few weeks he’s scheduled to be part of the Global
                        Youth Summit on the Environment. Have you heard of it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A little,” she said. “It’s going to be in Paris, right?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s right,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pressed another button, and the screens filled with images from past
                        summits.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nearly fifty thousand young people from around the world are expected to
                        descend on the city for four days of rallies and a scientific symposium,” Monty said, seamlessly
                        taking over the briefing. “As part of our cover story with FARM, we were already planning to be
                        there before Sinclair got involved. I’m on a symposium panel, and Sydney’s giving a speech at
                        one of the rallies.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn shot a surprised look at Sydney, who flashed a nervous smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But things changed four months ago when Sinclair unexpectedly announced the
                        Stavros Challenge,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s that?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s a lot of money, is what it is,” answered Rio. “One million euros!” he
                        said, drawing out each word carefully.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For what?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For the team of students who do the best job solving an environmental
                        problem,” answered Paris. “Sinclair thinks young people are better at coming up with fresh ideas
                        because they’re more open and idealistic. He plans to pick a different issue every year and give
                        away a million euros each time.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And we’re trying to win the money?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” said Monty. “We’re aiming for a nice finish between sixth and tenth.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre17">“That’s pretty specific,” Brooklyn said. “Why between
                        sixth and tenth?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“First place receives one million euros, with half going to their school or
                        institution and the other half being split up among the five team members for their education,”
                        said Monty. “The teams that finish second to fifth will each receive one hundred thousand euros.
                        These students will all have their pictures splashed across media and will undoubtedly be
                        scrutinized.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Undercover agents hate media and despise scrutiny,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“However, very little attention will be given to the teams that don’t win
                        anything,” said Monty. “Thirty teams were chosen for the competition, but only ten will reach
                        the final stage. We expect those to be the only people who will actually get significant
                        face-to-face time with Stavros.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So making the top ten is like finding the golden ticket?” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Exactly,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Here’s a silly question,” said Brooklyn. “Why do we care? I know he’s rich and
                        all, but why do we want to work so hard just to be in a room with Stavros Sinclair?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“To protect him,” said Mother. “He’s what’s known as a national-level asset,
                        which means countries can’t let him fall into the wrong hands. He only comes out in the open
                        once every few years, so there will be representatives from every spy agency in the world there.
                        Some will be keeping an eye on him, and others might be looking to snatch him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But we’ll be the only ones up close,” Sydney said proudly. “No one will expect
                        us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Including the Purple Thumb,” said Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn gave him a confused look. “The what?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-112" class="calibre17">“So far there’ve been three Global Youth Summits on the
                        Environment,” Mother answered. “The first was in Stockholm, Sweden, and on the final night,
                        there was a break-in at the eadquarters of a recycling technology firm that hosted the main
                        rally.” He pressed a button, and the monitors showed images from the crime scene. “Damage was
                        minimal, and the police decided that it was just a prank. The only significant evidence was a
                        purple thumbprint found in the middle of the CEO’s computer screen.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then came summit two in Tokyo,” said Monty. “It was sponsored by a group of
                        renewable energy companies, including the Fu¯jin Corporation, which makes turbines for wind
                        energy.” She walked over to the touchscreen and swiped on pictures from the Japanese crime
                        scene. These showed shattered computers and broken furniture strewn across the room. “This was
                        their headquarters the morning a er the summit ended. This time the damage was more substantial,
                        and, of course, there was another purple thumbprint.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Swedes only ran their thumbprint through their national database. It
                        didn’t match anything, so they stopped pursuing it,” said Mother. “But when the Japanese found a
                        second one, they shared the print with Interpol and the FBI, who found a match.” He tapped the
                        screen, and a mug shot appeared. “Meet Leyland Carmichael, an environmental extremist who
                        attacked multiple tech companies in the US and Canada.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Did the Americans arrest him?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, they didn’t,” he said. “You see, there was a slight problem&mdash;he’d
                        been dead for nearly three years.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn’s eyes opened wide. “That’s more than a <i class="calibre8">slight</i>
                        problem.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They even dug up his grave to make sure he was really buried in it,” he
                        continued. “They found his body, but you know what they didn’t find.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre17">“His thumb?” guessed Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Correct,” he answered. “He was missing his right thumb.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yet, somehow, the same thumbprint turned up at one of the hosting companies
                        for summit three in San Francisco,” said Monty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Is that the one when they had the big protest?” said Brooklyn. “When people
                        locked arms and blocked the street?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” answered Monty. “And since so much media attention was paid to that, few
                        people heard about this.” She swiped the screen so that the images changed to a different crime
                        scene. “The <i class="calibre8">Fulgora Storm Three</i>, a lithium ion battery prototype
                        being developed for a next generation electric car, was stolen, and a purple thumbprint was left
                        at the scene.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Each time, these people have made a bigger splash,” said Mother. “And the
                        worry is that they’re going to try to up their game again in Paris.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Which companies are sponsoring the Paris summit?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“None,” said Mother. “The expenses are being paid by a single individual.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He clicked the button, and once again the screen showed the publicity photo of
                        Stavros Sinclair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Which is why we’re going to be close to him to make sure they don’t do
                        anything,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So we’ve got to make it into the top ten,” Brooklyn said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">“What’s the challenge?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Rainmaking,” answered Monty. “Sinclair Scientifica wants creative approaches
                        to making artificial rainfall. They believe it can be used to counteract drought and famine
                        across the globe.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And do we have any idea how to make rain?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre17">“We do,” said Monty. “More important, we have access to
                        years of research. MI6 experimented with making artificial rain for nearly a decade. They gave
                        up on the project, but we tweaked their data, made some new models with Ben, and created a
                        proposal.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For a contest that’s supposed to be for students, it sounds like we cheated,”
                        Brooklyn said, only half joking. “I mean, it’s already kind of unfair that we have a
                        supercomputer, which I’m guessing most teams don’t. But to have nearly ten years of secret
                        government research doesn’t seem fair at all.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It would be cheating if we were trying to win,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">“But we’re only shooting for sixth place. Besides, we had to ensure that we made
                        the top thirty.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And did we?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” he replied. “We received word two weeks ago and were told to keep it
                        secret until the official list was announced. That was made public earlier today. There are
                        teams representing leading research institutions and schools from around the world. Including
                        one that’s surprising.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pressed the button, and the names of the thirty finalists appeared on the
                        screen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn smiled instantly when she recognized one of them. “MIST!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Metropolitan Institute of Science and Technology,” she said. “It’s a
                        school in New York. Actually, it’s the school I wanted to attend.” She looked around the table
                        at the others. “You know, before I found out about teenage spies and castles with hidden rooms.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Here’s a <i class="calibre8">clanger</i>,” Sydney said, noticing an obvious
                        mistake.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">“They have us representing FARM.” She motioned to the list. “But they also have
                        us listed as Kinloch Abbey.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre17">“That’s not a mistake,” said Mother. “You’re the team
                        from FARM. There’s another team of students from Kinloch who made the final thirty.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How’s that even possible?” asked Rio. “Who do they have who knows anything
                        about rainmaking and computer weather models?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">And that’s when it hit them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Charlotte,” said Kat. “They’ve got Charlotte.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You mean the girl who used to live in my room?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No way,” said Sydney. “That can’t be.” Then she looked at Mother and saw it in
                        his expression. “Can it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” said Mother. “Charlotte is the captain of the team from Kinloch. I just
                        got off the phone with the headmaster. The school’s very excited.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It doesn’t make sense,” said Sydney. “Why would she quit our team, only to
                        form another one?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I can tell you one million reasons why,” said Rio. “Because we’re going to
                        finish sixth, and she wants the money.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We can’t let her do that,” Sydney said to Mother. “It’s not fair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We have to get them disqualified.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’ll do no such thing,” said Mother. “It would raise alarms at the school and
                        might make Charlotte retaliate. As far as FARM is concerned, we’re thrilled that Kinloch is
                        sending a team, and in the spirit of scientific cooperation, we’re going to help them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re letting them use Ben to prepare their weather models,” said Monty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s bonkers!” exclaimed Paris. “We can’t let them down here.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre17">“It will only be Charlotte,” said Monty. “She’s their
                        computer specialist, and she already knows everything about us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And we know everything about her,” said Sydney. “Like the fact that she quit
                        on us. Why are we helping them? So they can win a million euros?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Perhaps because she didn’t know Charlotte and this betrayal wasn’t personal,
                        Brooklyn was the first one to see Mother and Monty’s plan. “No. We’re helping them to make sure
                        they <i class="calibre8">don’t</i> win a million euros.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” said Mother. “If they win, then Charlotte will get all the media and
                        scrutiny we’re working so hard to avoid. Any light that shines on her has the chance to spill
                        over on us. So we need to make sure they don’t win anything.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How do we do that?” asked Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We use me,” Brooklyn said. “If we work side by side, then I can hack her and
                        stop them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">You</i> are going to hack <i
                            class="calibre8">Charlotte</i>?” Rio asked, disbelieving. “No offense, but that’s easier
                        said than done.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“He’s right,” said Paris. “She’s a computer virtuoso.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn looked at them defiantly. “What makes you think I’m not?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s nothing personal,” said Rio. “It’s just … One time we were down here, and
                        Charlotte said she could hack anyone on the planet. Anyone. So we dared her to hack the prime
                        minister.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“An hour later we were reading his private schedule,” he answered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So she failed,” Brooklyn said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What are you talking about?” asked Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Instead of the prime minister, it sounds like she hacked some appointments
                        secretary,” answered Brooklyn. “That’s a fail.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre17">Mother and Monty both smiled at this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You think you could do better?” asked Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I don’t see why not,” said Brooklyn. “I hacked Serena Ochoa.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The others shared a look for a moment, unsure if this was a name they should
                        recognize.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m sorry,” said Sydney. “Who’s Serena Ochoa?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A hero of mine,” Brooklyn answered. “She’s a professor of advanced computing
                        and mathematical sciences at Cal Tech. I hacked into her laptop so that it gave her a special
                        greeting on her birthday.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio was thoroughly unimpressed. “Not exactly the prime minister now, is it,
                        mate?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You didn’t let me finish,” Brooklyn said. “At the time, Dr.Ochoa was an
                        astronaut on board the International Space Station. In order to reach her laptop, I had to hack
                        into NASA, the Department of Defense, and Roscosmos.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What’s Roscosmos?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s the Russian space federation,” she answered. “And, unlike Charlotte, I
                        wasn’t using a supercomputer capable of performing over five hundred trillion floating-point
                        operations per second.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For a moment, there was stunned silence around the table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Just out of curiosity,” Monty said, “what were you using?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“An eight-year-old PC in my middle school computer lab," Brooklyn answered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">More silence until Rio uttered a single word. “Wow.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yeah,” replied Brooklyn in full swagger. “Wow.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, then,” Mother said, barely stifling a laugh. “I guess that settles
                        that.”</p>

                <article>
                    <h2><strong>14. </strong>Charlotte</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">She wore the Kinloch Abbey</span> uniform of burgundy
                        blazer and tartan skirt as she rode in Coach A, seat 22B on the train to Aisling. Her dark brown
                        eyes and full, round cheeks perpetually looked like they were on the verge of a smile. Her
                        chestnut hair was cropped just above the shoulders and swayed ever so slightly due to the motion
                        of the train. And her horn-rimmed glasses managed to look hip, bookish, and nerdy all at once.
                        She was the picture-perfect schoolgirl. No one would have guessed that unlike other passengers
                        who killed time checking social media or playing mindless video games, she was busy hacking into
                        the laptops and smartphones of everybody seated in first class.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">You know, just for kicks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Her name was Charlotte Sloane. That was it. There was a time when that was one
                        of many aliases she had. But she no longer spied for MI6, so now one name was all she got. Of
                        course, in some corners of the dark web, she was better known as UKFlamethrower1999 or
                        DundeeDeathMonger707, but mostly she was just Char, as the girls in the boarding house called
                        her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">In this instance, her hacking was more mischievous than malicious. She wasn’t
                        stealing passwords or scamming bank records like she sometimes did. She was just keeping her
                        skills sharp. “The greatest basketball players in the world are great because they practice
                        shooting and dribbling so much it becomes as natural as
                        breathing,” she once told Sydney. “This is my</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre1">practice. This is my breathing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Coach A, seat 22B wasn’t just some random ticket assignment. She’d ridden the
                        train o en enough to identify it as the best location for this sort of practice. She even called
                        it “the throne,” just as she called herself the “queen of hacks.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">There were three things about the throne that made it better than all the other
                        seats on the ScotRail train. First, it was located just two rows behind the plastic barrier that
                        marked first class. This meant it was a cheap ticket but still close enough to the router for
                        her to steal the free Wi-Fi that came with expensive fares. Plastic barriers may stop
                        passengers, but they do nothing to slow down radio waves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Second, it came with a table and electrical outlet. This allowed her to spread
                        out with her laptop while she charged her other devices. Finally, it had an unobstructed view of
                        six of the nine seats in first class. This let her see most of the people she was hacking, which
                        made it so much more fun.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">For example, on this trip, she was able to see that the tall blonde with the
                        movie-star sunglasses sitting in 3F was holding hands with her half-sleeping boyfriend in 4F at
                        the exact same time she was sending flirty text messages to the man across the aisle in 1B. It
                        also let her see that the car salesman in 8A looked nothing like the photo he’d just posted on a
                        dating app.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">Everybody lies,</i> she told herself. <i
                            class="calibre8">Everybody’s running a scam</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Ticket, please,” said the conductor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Here you go,” she said as she handed him the orange-and-white round-trip
                        ticket. “I bet you enjoyed the Celtic game this week.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">His eyes lit up. “You bet I did. Two-nil over Rangers in the Old Firm derby.”
                        He stopped for a moment. “How’d you know I was a supporter?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-120" class="calibre17">“I take this train a lot,” she said. “I’ve heard you talk
                        about it before.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This was a total lie. She did recognize him from previous trips, but she only
                        knew he liked Celtic because of an app on his phone. His had been the first one she hacked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’re going to win the cup again this year,” he said proudly before he
                        continued down the aisle. “Mark my words.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Unlike the hackers in movies who always scurried about in the shadows,
                        Charlotte liked to engage people in conversation. She wanted to be seen precisely because it
                        made people less suspicious. The conductor would remember her fondly as the schoolgirl who
                        talked football. There’s no way she could be up to any mischief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The final hack was the hardest. It was a laptop belonging to an accountant from
                        Edinburgh sitting in 4B who had the latest firewall installed. But Charlotte still managed to
                        breach it just as the train reached the platform at Aisling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She checked her watch. The trip had taken twenty-three minutes, and during that
                        time she’d hacked nine passengers and the conductor. Solid if not spectacular. <i
                            class="calibre8">This is my
                            practice. This is my breathing</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">If there was any awkwardness about coming back to the FARM for the first time
                        since she’d le , it was offset by the sense of familiarity that greeted her as she followed the
                        footpath from the station. She knew every inch of it by heart: the curve of the stone fence that
                        lined the road, the vibrant yellow of the rapeseed lowers blanketing the field next to the
                        airstrip. This made it all the more startling when a total stranger answered the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who are you?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-121" class="calibre17">“Brooklyn,” mumbled the girl through a mouthful of
                        chocolate chip cookie. “You must be Charlotte.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Charlotte couldn’t believe it. Was it possible that they’d already replaced
                        her?</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn swallowed her cookie and smiled. “Come on in,” she said, like they
                        were long-lost friends. “We’ve been expecting you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Ever since learning that Charlotte had a team going to the competition,
                        Brooklyn had been carefully planning for this interaction. She needed to hack a hacker in order
                        to make sure that Kinloch didn’t win the Stavros Challenge. To do that, she had three targets
                        she needed to hit. If she missed any of them, her plan would implode.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The first was to take advantage of the fact Charlotte didn’t know she existed.
                        That was why she’d wanted to greet her at the door. It put Charlotte on her heels from the very
                        beginning. Brooklyn had watched as she approached the house and timed it down to the last
                        second, taking a bite of cookie right before answering the door to make it seem like she was
                        goofy and friendly rather than cool and calculating.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Before Charlotte could react, Monty stepped out from the kitchen. “I see you
                        two have met. The kids are at school and Mother’s in Edinburgh, so it’s just us girls. I’m
                        making lunch right now, so why don’t you get to work and I’ll bring it down when it’s done.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Sounds good,” Brooklyn said as she took another bite of cookie and headed for
                        the basement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Charlotte’s head was still spinning as she and Brooklyn went down the stairs
                        toward the priest hole. “I’m sorry,” she said, trying to piece it all together. “Who are you?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m the new you,” answered Brooklyn. Then, with as much New York City attitude
                        as she could muster, she added, “They call me Charlotte
                        2.0.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-122" class="calibre17">“I beg your pardon.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“ ’Cause I’m the new-and-improved American,” she answered. “You know, like when
                        they come out with a computer upgrade, they call it 2.0?” she said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, I’m quite familiar with …”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No offense to you,” said Brooklyn. “I mean, they say you’re really good at
                        computers. Personally, I don’t know anything about them. That’s not my specialty.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No?” she said. “Then what is?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Breaking in and out of buildings,” said Brooklyn. “Stealing things.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, then, you’re quite an upgrade,” Charlotte replied snootily.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Charlotte’s reaction told Brooklyn that she’d hit a nerve. This was the second
                        part of her plan. She was taking advantage of Charlotte’s one great weakness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">She thinks she’s better than us,</i> Sydney told Brooklyn
                        the night before. <i class="calibre8">She’s never come out and said it, but I know she
                            thinks she’s </i><i class="calibre8">better than all of us</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This led to a discussion among the others, and even though none of them had
                        ever talked about it before, they all agreed that it was true. Kat, Paris, Rio, and Sydney had
                        all survived difficult childhoods filled with poverty and heartbreak. But that wasn’t true of
                        Charlotte.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">She wasn’t poor,</i> Rio had said. <i class="calibre8">She
                            had a good family</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Charlotte had grown up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where her parents were
                        college professors. Her mother taught computer science and her dad mathematics. Everything about
                        her life was perfect until she was ten years old and her parents were killed in an auto
                        accident. Because of this, said the others, she acted like she was
                        better than they were. They were born into their sadness, but hers was the result of an
                        accident. It was almost as
                        if they deserved it and she didn’t.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So are you excited about going to Paris?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s always exciting to see Paris,” Charlotte answered, like she’d been there
                        a thousand times. “It’s my favorite city.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I can’t wait,” said Brooklyn. “I’ve never been. Of course, I’ve never been
                        anywhere. Except New Jersey … and now Scotland.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Charlotte gave her a superior look, and Brooklyn knew that the second step of
                        her plan was complete. The third, and most crucial, was to conceal any hint that she was a
                        hacker too. If Charlotte got even a whiff that Brooklyn knew her way around a computer, she’d be
                        suspicious.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Once they got to the priest hole, Charlotte put her backpack on the table and
                        pulled out her laptop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wait a second. I thought you were going to use Beny,” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I beg your pardon?” said Charlotte.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why do you have your laptop if you’re going to use Beny?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who’s Beny?” asked Charlotte.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The big computer,” Brooklyn answered, pointing at it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“First of all, it’s not a <i class="calibre8">big</i> computer, it’s a <i
                            class="calibre8">super</i>computer,” said Charlotte. “I’m going to access it with my laptop,
                        which contains the data I need for my weather models. Also, his name is <i
                            class="calibre8">Ben</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know,” Brooklyn said, taking a suddenly serious tone. “But it houldn’t be.
                        ‘Ben’ is short for Benjamin or Benedict. It’s an Anglo name. But this computer is named a er
                        Benito Viñes. That’s a Spanish name. And the nickname for Benito is <i
                            class="calibre8">Beny</i>.
                        Spelled with one <i class="calibre8">n</i>, not two.” She smiled and added, “I may not know
                        anything about supercomputers. But I know a lot about Spanish.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre17">Brooklyn had Charlotte right where she wanted her, all
                        distracted and discombobulated. She was not her normal, sharp self. And in the middle of all
                        this, Brooklyn saw her opportunity. She reached into her pocket and pulled out the keylogger
                        that she’d found in her desk the first day. The one that Charlotte had accidentally left behind.
                        She hid it in the palm of her hand just like Rio had taught her and slipped it unnoticed into
                        Charlotte’s backpack.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Charlotte was too good to hack head-on, so this was going to be Brooklyn’s
                        backdoor. She was counting on Charlotte to find it in her backpack and assume that it had always
                        been there, overlooked somehow. If she checked it, she would see that it was hers. She would see
                        that it had her files on it. What she wouldn’t see, however, was the tiny program that Brooklyn
                        installed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">How do you hack a hacker? You don’t. You let them hack themselves.</p>

                    <h2><strong>15. </strong>XUHET</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">The P4 Jean Merieux-Inserm Laboratory</span> in Lyon,
                        France, was one of the most advanced biological research centers in the world. The scientists
                        inside the highly secure facility had to wear futuristic-looking BSL-4&ndash;positive pressure
                        “spacesuits,” because they worked exclusively with the deadliest viruses on the planet. Even the
                        slightest exposure to them could prove fatal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Inside the lab’s most secure room, two scientists prepared a vial of virus
                        identified only as XUHET to be transported to their research colleagues at the Pasteur Institute
                        in Paris. This vial was placed in a specially designed metal case the size of a thick book. The
                        case was airtight, strong enough to withstand a blast of dynamite, and could be opened only with
                        a randomly changing fifteen-digit computer-generated code. Even if it somehow fell into the
                        wrong hands, there was no way for an outsider to open it without destroying its contents.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Soon after the scientists were done, a red-and-white armored truck pulled away
                        from the building and got onto the A6 highway leading to Paris. It was closely followed by a
                        chase car with two agents from the DGSI, the French intelligence agency in charge of
                        counterterrorism.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The highly trained agents were ready to use lethal force to protect the cargo.
                        But even they didn’t know that the truck was a decoy.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre17">The actual case was tucked inside a backpack carried by
                        another agent, who along with his partner was boarding a train for Paris. This was an old-school
                        intelligence trick. If anyone had learned the specimen was being transported, they’d be focused
                        on the armored truck. No one would suspect the pair with long hair and scruffy beards who
                        blended in with all of the other college students backpacking through Europe. The two certainly
                        didn’t look like the assassins that they were.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The train from Lyon to Paris took two hours, and the pair was expected to reach
                        the Pasteur Institute just after noon. When they hadn’t arrived by one thirty, the agent in
                        charge of the operation began to worry. By five o’clock an extensive search was underway at all
                        locations along the agents’ route.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It was two days until their bodies were discovered floating in the Seine. There
                        was no sign of the backpack or the case, though there was one unmistakable clue that hadn’t been
                        washed away by the water.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">On each agent’s forehead was a distinctive purple thumbprint.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Brooklyn stared at her closet</span> and had absolutely
                        no idea what to do. For the first time in her life she was packing. There’d been six previous
                        occasions when all her possessions were dumped into cardboard boxes and dropped off at a new
                        foster home. But that was moving. Never before had she put clothes into a suitcase with the idea
                        that she would return. This was the latest in a whirlwind of first-time-evers that included
                        flying over an ocean, signing the United Kingdom Official Secrets oath, eating baked beans for
                        breakfast, and learning how to use a bobby pin to pick the lock on a pair of military-grade
                        North Korean leg shackles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Not only that but it was also the first time she had clothes to choose from.
                        Monty had taken her shopping in Edinburgh, and together with the clothes Sydney bought for her
                        in New York, she actually had a wardrobe. It was mostly jeans, shorts, and graphic tees, but it
                        was still hard to choose. In the end, she decided to take everything. That way she would have
                        plenty of options when she got to Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What are you doing?” asked Sydney, who walked in to find</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Brooklyn sprawled across the overstuffed suitcase, using her body weight to hold
                        it closed while she zipped it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Packing,” Brooklyn answered sheepishly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Packing what?” she asked.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre17">Brooklyn gave her a look like it may be some sort of
                        trick question. “My suitcase.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Bad news, mate,” Sydney said with a laugh. “That’s <i class="calibre8">our</i>
                        suitcase.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn sat up and sighed. “Yours and mine?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yours and mine <i class="calibre8">and</i> Kat’s,” Sydney answered. “We’re
                        travel triplets. That means we share a room and we share a suitcase. We also only get to bring
                        along one of those little shampoo bottles, so get ready to argue over whose we take.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay then,” said Brooklyn. “How much am I supposed to bring?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">The only one who travels right is the one who travels
                            light</i>,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Wow, there’s a Motherism for everything.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Forget all that tuxedo-and-evening-gown nonsense you see in spy movies,” said
                        Sydney. “When you’re on a real mission, you’ve got to be able to pick up and go in an instant.
                        You can’t do that if you’re lugging around a bunch of suitcases. But we can fix this,” Sydney
                        offered as she dumped the clothes onto the bed. “We just have to start over.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As they started packing the appropriate amount, Brooklyn said, “Kat’s going to
                        hate being a travel triplet with me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What makes you think that?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn gave her an incredulous look. “I’m pretty sure she despises me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nah,” said Sydney. “You got that wrong.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really, because she never says more than two words to me,” replied Brooklyn.
                        “Unless it’s ‘Get out of my seat’ or ‘That’s not supposed to go there.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s just Kat being Kat,” said Sydney. “I told you, she sees he world
                        differently. Sometimes she’ll say something rude, but she doesn’t mean
                        it that way. And sometimes she’ll do something you think is totally mad only to find out later
                        it’s
                        really quite lovely. Like her caper with the chocolate bars.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Her what?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For one week last year, she was obsessed with Cadbury Crunchie chocolate
                        bars,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Never heard of them,” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ve been deprived,” Sydney replied. “You’re going to love the chocolate
                        here. So much better than in the States. Anyway, without warning or explanation, Kat started
                        buying Crunchies like mad. One day, she’d buy ten in a single store. The next day, she’d buy one
                        each from ten different stores.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Does she have that much of a sweet tooth?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She’d only eat one a day,” Sydney answered. “And for the rest, she’d just open
                        the wrapper and offer the chocolate to us. At first we loved it. I mean, who doesn’t love a free
                        Crunchie? But by the end of the week we’d had so many, even Rio was turning her down. And Rio
                        never turns down food.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Did you ask her why she was doing it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“All she’d say was that it was a ‘project for school,’ ” Sydney answered. “We
                        didn’t get the full story for a couple weeks. Turns out, the chocolate company was running a
                        sweepstakes to give away five thousand pounds. Kat was comparing the serial numbers on the
                        outside of the wrappers with the game pieces on the inside. She wanted to see if she could crack
                        the code.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How is that a project for school?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because when she did crack the code and won the five thousand pounds, she
                        donated it all to her old school back in Nepal.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s amazing,” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre17">“It is,” said Sydney. “And so is she. Kat is absolutely
                        amazing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">And if the cost of that is a little social awkwardness, then the price is well
                        worth it.” She paused for a moment before adding, “Besides, I think she’s scared of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn couldn’t believe it. “In what way am I scary?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not scared like that,” said Sydney. “She’s scared you’ll be like Charlotte.
                        It’s difficult for Kat to make friends, but the two of them were thick as thieves. It really
                        helped her come out of her hell. Then one day … Char was gone.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s the question, isn’t it?” said Sydney. “Two and a half years together
                        and she just leaves. No warning. No good-bye. The rest of us went to school one day, but she
                        stayed home. Said she was sick. When we got back, there was no sign of her. Mother had to tell
                        us what happened.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“She didn’t give a reason?” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“None,” said Sydney. “She hasn’t even said a word to me at school.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They talked some more about Charlotte until an urgent voice interrupted them.
                        “You do realize that we’re wheels-up in less than two hours?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Monty stood at the door, her face the picture of impatience.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Is there a reason you’re not getting ready?” she continued. “Is it because
                        you’re trying to drive me crazy? Or is that just a bonus on top of some other goal?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We <i class="calibre8">are</i> getting ready,” Sydney said defensively. “We’re
                        packing.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really? Because it sounds like you’re gossiping,” said Monty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">“Besides, when does it take two of you to pack for one person?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Um … that’s my fault,” Brooklyn said, a bit embarrassed. “I was having trouble
                        figuring out the whole
                        how-much-you’re-supposed-to-bring-on-a-spy-mission thing. I went overboard, and Sydney’s helping
                        me get it back under control.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Monty noticed the pile of clothes on the bed and so ened her tone. “I see.
                        Well, now you know, so hang those up and let’s get a move on. Vauxhall Cross has us under the
                        microscope, and I will not let us fall behind schedule before the mission’s even started.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">If Monty was uncharacteristically gruff, it was because the team found itself
                        facing unprecedented scrutiny. Everything changed the moment the French secret agents were
                        murdered. Once their bodies were discovered with purple thumbprints on their foreheads,
                        Operation Willy Wonka became an MI6 top priority.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">It was so important that the team was about to board a small unmarked plane and
                        fly to a top-secret facility outside of London for a week of mission-specific training alongside
                        British Special Forces.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Before that, however, Brooklyn needed to speak to Mother. She wanted to talk to
                        him in private while they were still at the FARM, so once she was packed, she le the house and
                        crossed the lawn to the airstrip. She found him in the flight tower getting the radar and
                        communication equipment ready for the plane to arrive.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, hello. What brings you up here?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This was her first time inside the tower, and her train of thought was derailed
                        when she saw the furnishings. “You live here?” she asked incredulously, looking around at the
                        sparse furnishings. Other than the air traffic control equipment, there was little more than a
                        metal cot, an electric teakettle, and a bookcase filled with old paperbacks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, I’m the caretaker of the airfield,” he said. “And living in the tower
                        comes with the job. Like the old lighthouse keepers.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“When you said you lived in an apartment in the tower, I assumed it was an
                        actual, you know, <i class="calibre8">apartment</i>,” she
                        said.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre17">“The flat’s one floor below,” he said. “I use it as an
                        office. To be honest, I prefer sleeping up here. The furniture’s not much, but the view’s
                        magnificent.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn couldn’t disagree. Windows wrapped around the entire room, giving it a
                        360-degree panoramic vista that stretched from the North Sea in the east to the sun setting over
                        the highlands in the west.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“A cuppa, a good book, and this view is the best relaxation I know,” he said.
                        “However, I doubt you came here to talk about my accommodations, so …?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right … yeah,” she said as she tried to refocus. She wasn’t sure how to broach
                        this subject, so she just dived right in. “Have you ever heard of the Slater Loan Company?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” he answered without hesitation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She stared at him and shook her head. “It’s amazing how good you are at lying,”
                        she said. “If I didn’t know better, I’d believe you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He paused for a moment and said, “Tell me what you know.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ve been spending a lot of time with Ben. Or Beny, as I like to call him,”
                        she said. “And I’ve been digging around trash cans.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ve been doing what?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s an old hacker’s trick,” she said. “If you put something in the computer’s
                        trash can, it looks like it’s been erased, but it hasn’t. All you’ve got to do is pluck it out
                        again. It’s the perfect place to hide a file you don’t want anyone to see.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“But you saw something?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She pulled a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolded it, and handed it to him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Slater Loan Company,” he said, reading it. “Alton H. Slater, CEO.” He
                        looked up at her. “This is the company you think I know something about?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre17">“Don’t even try to deny it,” she said. “Now, there’s
                        nothing particularly suspicious about this. <i class="calibre8">Except</i> that it was
                        hidden. I mean, why go to all the trouble to scrub and hide that in a trash can unless there <i
                            class="calibre8">is</i> something suspicious about it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Now she was getting excited. “So I started looking around. Remember, I was able
                        to hack into a bank using an old PC in my school computer lab. With Beny, the sky’s the limit,
                        so I found out everything there is to know about the Slater Loan Company.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother was torn. He didn’t want her to discover what she’d learned, but he was
                        amazed at how good she was at this. “So what is there to find out?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not much,” she said. “Even though it’s a loan company, it’s never made any
                        loans. Not one. It just borrows money from one bank and pays it back to another. That’s all it
                        does. Borrow and pay back.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So that tells me that Alton Slater’s a substandard businessman,” he replied.
                        “But it doesn’t mean he’s a villain.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s what I thought too, until I was playing Scrabble with Kat,” she said.
                        “You know Scrabble, the word game.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Quite well,” he answered. “Kat’s been known to crush my soul playing it. Which
                        is hard to take, considering English is my native tongue and she spent the first ten years of
                        her life speaking Nepali.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s good to hear,” said Brooklyn. “I thought she just enjoyed humiliating
                        me. Anyway, she’s been using the game to teach me code-breaking, and she said the most amazing
                        thing. She told me that the world champions of Scrabble are never writers or English teachers
                        like you’d think. They’re always mathematicians. It’s because writers and teachers are obsessed
                        with words but mathematicians just figure out the points. She said the trick was not thinking of
                        the tiles as letters, but as symbols.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre17">Brooklyn reached into her pocket and pulled out a handful
                        of Scrabble tiles, which she spread out on the table. “So I decided to do that with the Slater
                        Loan Company. This is how it’s spelled on the document, ‘Company’ abbreviated as ‘Co.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She arranged the tiles so they spelled:</p>
                    <p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre16"><b class="calibre14">THE SLATER LOAN CO</b></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Now, look at this,” she said. She rearranged them so they spelled:</p>
                    <p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre16"><b class="calibre14">ALTON H SLATER CEO</b></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They’re the exact same letters,” she said. “That can’t be a coincidence.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So, what does that tell you?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That the Slater Loan Company and Alton H. Slater, CEO, are fake,” she said.
                        “They’re anagrams. Someone’s playing a word game, but they’re playing it with real banks and
                        real money. The question we need to ask ourselves is who’s playing the game.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She rearranged the letters again so that they now spelled:</p>
                    <p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre16"><b class="calibre14">CHARLOTTE SLOANE</b></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother let out a deep sigh. “And what does that tell you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn looked up and locked eyes with Mother. “I think Charlotte created a
                        fake company so she could build online relationships with banks and access them without them
                        knowing. I think she either stole or was about to steal a lot of money. <i
                            class="calibre8">That’s</i> what it tells me.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother sat there for a moment and shook his head. “Yes,” he said with a heavy
                        sigh. “That’s exactly what happened. And it wasn’t the first time. She’d done something similar
                        in the States.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-135" class="calibre17">“Charlotte was understandably angry at the world when her
                        parents died,” he replied. “She expressed that anger with behavior that became more and more
                        criminal. First she hacked some businesses, and then she moved on to banks. It took quite a
                        negotiation with the FBI to get her released into my custody.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why’d you go to all that trouble?” Brooklyn asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“For one thing, I know exactly what it’s like to suddenly lose your entire
                        family,” he said. “I thought I understood her. I thought if we put her in a supportive and
                        caring environment, she’d do better.” He looked up at Brooklyn. “I was wrong. And, when I
                        realized that, I told her she could no longer be part of the team.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You kicked her off,” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then why did you tell everyone she quit?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“To protect her,” he said. “And to protect the team. Monty and I caught her
                        before she actually stole any money, thank goodness. That could’ve destroyed everything. And she
                        really is a good person. She has so many wonderful traits. But she couldn’t be part of all this.
                        And, when I let her go, I thought we’d have to cancel this mission. The contest requires five
                        people per team. But then fate delivered us a solution.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Me?” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You,” he said. “I came across the file of a twelve-year-old girl who’d hacked
                        into a government agency, and why? To bring justice.” He shook his head in amazement thinking
                        about it. “There were these two astonishing girls who both did the same hing, but for very
                        different reasons.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So, if you hadn’t been one person short for the competition, I’d be in some
                        supervised group home right now?” she asked, slightly wounded.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-136" class="calibre17">“I knew the moment I saw your file that you belonged with
                        us,” he said. “Nothing would’ve kept me from being in that courtroom that day.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How’d you happen to find it?” she asked. “The file with my case?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The same way I found Charlotte’s,” he answered. “I was looking for Annie. My
                        daughter’s quite the computer whiz, so I always keep an eye out for any young female hackers who
                        get in trouble.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn weighed this for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Do you want me to keep this secret from everyone?” she asked. “The part about
                        you kicking Charlotte off the team?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I won’t ask you to lie to them,” he said. “But I’m not sure it does anybody
                        any good if they find out.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Me neither,” she said. “We’ll just keep it between us.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Thank you,” he answered. “Now we have to get moving.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Ninety minutes later a twin-engine turbo-prop Beechcra King Air B200 with no
                        flight markings landed in total darkness on the grass airstrip that was once RAF Aisling. It was
                        on the ground for less than ten minutes as seven passengers boarded. The last one on was Mother,
                        who pulled up the stairs, locked the hatch, and signaled the pilot that they were ready to go.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The interior of the plane was small enough that Brooklyn could almost reach
                        from side to side. There were a total of eight seats, and she took one in the back row, staring
                        out the window as the plane took off and soared into the moonless night.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">When they encountered turbulence above the North Sea, she clutched her armrest
                        and told herself not to panic. She took a deep breath and counted to ten. But the nervousness
                        didn’t fade.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She had no idea what to expect, but she was positive that the whirlwind of
                        first-time-evers was just beginning.</p>

                    <h2><strong>17. </strong>Goldfinger Avenue</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">The bank robbery taking place</span> twenty miles west
                        of central London was nothing like the cyberattacks committed by Brooklyn and Charlotte. This
                        was an old-fashioned heist, complete with bad guys who carried guns and wore ski masks to hide
                        their faces.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The fact that Brooklyn and the rest of the team witnessed it in person was just
                        a case of being in the wrong place at the right time. They were on their way to training but the
                        street had been blocked off, so all they could do was stand a safe distance away and watch the
                        drama unfold from behind a line of wooden barricades.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I can’t believe we’re actually seeing this,” Brooklyn said to Monty. “How’s it
                        even possible?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Before them four police cars were fanned out in a semicircle in front of the
                        bank entrance. The officers had taken cover behind their vehicles, and everything was at a
                        standstill until one of the robbers leaned out the front door holding a hostage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He shouted something at the cops, but Brooklyn couldn’t make it out. She
                        noticed a police sniper crawling into position on a rooftop across the street and pointed it out
                        to Sydney and Kat who nodded silently, as if speaking aloud might alert the criminals.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Give up now! Before somebody gets hurt!” an officer called over a bullhorn.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-138" class="calibre17">The robbers responded to this demand with a hail of
                        bullets, and soon shots were fired from both sides. Even at this distance, Brooklyn reflexively
                        stepped back to avoid getting hit by any stray gunfire.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Suddenly the shooting stopped as a silver Jaguar convertible came racing down
                        the street. The driver slammed on the brakes, and the rear of the sports car fishtailed all the
                        way around until it slid to a screeching halt against the curb.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Out stepped the driver, dressed in a slick black suit and tie. He deftly pulled
                        a pistol from his shoulder holster, pointed it right at the door to the bank, and … <i
                            class="calibre8">froze</i>. He just stood there
                        for what seemed like an eternity until he finally put his gun back in the holster, turned in the
                        opposite direction, and asked, “What’s my line again?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Cut!” yelled the director as an entire film crew let out a groan of
                        exasperation. This was their third try, and there was no reason to think he’d get it right on
                        the fourth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“ ‘I’m here for queen and country, and I’ve come to make a withdrawal!’ ” the
                        director said into his bullhorn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s it, that’s it!” said the actor. “I’ll get it this time. I promise.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’ll pick it up on the reverse angle when we come back,” the director said,
                        seething with frustration. “That’s lunch!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">A bell sounded, and crewmembers suddenly materialized from everywhere. Brooklyn
                        was amazed at how many people were involved in shooting a movie. It was jarring in a humorous
                        way to watch the men who moments before were playing bank robbers take off their masks and make
                        small talk with the cops who’d just been pointing guns at them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The woman showing the team around the film studio turned to Mother and shook
                        her head. “You’d think he’d be able to remember one bloody
                        sentence,” she said, incredulous. “The name of the movie is <i class="calibre8">Queen and
                            Country</i>.
                        That’s half the line.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Their guide was unlike anyone Brooklyn had ever met. Nearly six feet tall, she
                        had a shock of silver hair, was missing her left pinkie, and walked with a slight limp. Her name
                        was Gertrude Shepherd, but to everyone at Vauxhall Cross she was known simply as Tru. A
                        legendary MI6 operative, she’d served as a field agent for more than twenty-five years, and
                        rumor had it the missing finger and limp were the results of a back-alley knife fight in
                        Bangkok. In reality she lost the finger gardening and the limp was an old skiing injury, but she
                        never let the truth get in the way of her own mythology. Besides, she really had been in a
                        Bangkok knife fight but walked out of that alley unscathed, although the same couldn’t be said
                        of the Chinese spy who’d lured her there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Tru was now a command officer, and among other duties she was Mother’s direct
                        supervisor. She was also the technical advisor for the upcoming spy thriller <i
                            class="calibre8">Queen and Country</i>, which is why the team was at Pinewood Studios just
                        outside of London in the town of Iver Heath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Is that Jonny Lott?” Paris asked excitedly when the forgetful movie star
                        walked past them, headed for his trailer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Tragically, yes,” said Tru.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Who’s Jonny Lott?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“One of the best footballers in the world,” said Rio. “He’s the star of Man U.
                        He’s a star on the national team too.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And unfortunately, he’s the star of this cinematic masterpiece,” said Tru.
                        “That’s what you get when you try to turn a footballer into an action hero. Wonderful to look
                        at. Thick as a post. I imagine you’d have the same level of success if you took the lead from
                        some West End play and put him in goal for Arsenal.” She turned to address the whole group.
                        “Back to the buggies.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre17">They climbed into a pair of golf carts and, with Tru
                        driving one and Mother the other, resumed their caravan across the studio lot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Ever since the 1930s, Pinewood had been home to movies ranging from early
                        Alfred Hitchcock mysteries to massive <i class="calibre8">Star Wars</i> blockbusters. But the
                        series most associated with
                        the studio was evidenced by the fact they drove along 007 Drive before turning onto Goldfinger
                        Avenue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Every James Bond movie has filmed on the lot going back to <i
                            class="calibre8">Dr. No</i> in 1962,” Tru said while she drove. “So Pinewood
                        holds a pecial meaning for creaky old birdwatchers like me. As a goodwill gesture, MI6 makes a
                        senior agent available to offer technical expertise on any films that feature the Secret
                        Intelligence Service.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sitting next to her, Brooklyn was awestruck as they passed the different
                        soundstages. Each had a sign on its door with the name of the movie that was shooting inside.
                        Tru listed off the stars of the films like they were old friends. She parked the buggy by the
                        entrance to Soundstage D next to the props building in the middle of the lot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">City of Light</i>,” Brooklyn said, reading the name of the
                        production off the door. “Who’s starring in that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You are, dear,” said Tru.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’ll show you,” she responded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Tru led them through a green door into a cavernous room 165 feet long by 110
                        feet wide. There were four large sets on the stage, but it was impossible to tell what they were
                        from behind. All the team could see were the backs of fake walls spray-painted with the words
                        <span class="calibre7">PROPERTY DEPARTMENT&mdash;PINEWOOD STUDIOS</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Welcome to Stage D,” said Tru. “Countless films have been shot in this room.
                        If you li up the floor, you can see the water tank that was
                        turned into the Miami Beach swimming pool for <i class="calibre8">Goldfinger</i>. This is where
                        they
                        built the entrance stairs to Hogwarts and King’s Cross station for one of the Harry Potter
                        movies. And, for the next seven days, it’s where you’ll conduct your training.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me get this straight,” said Mother, disbelieving. “After years of
                        admonishing me to maintain a low profile and take every possible precaution to mask my identity
                        as a spy, you’re training my team on Goldfinger Avenue in a soundstage where they literally make
                        James Bond films.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Tru flashed a wide grin, revealing a gap between her middle teeth. “Ingenious,
                        isn’t it?” she said. “Come now, I’ll show you.” She motioned them to follow her around to the
                        other side of the sets and continued talking as they walked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The set designers have re-created key locations you’ll encounter in Paris, and
                        you’re going to spend the next week learning every inch of them,” she said. “Now, if we wanted
                        to do this somewhere else, say, an empty warehouse in Milton Keynes, we would’ve had to haul
                        everything over there in lorries, which would’ve taken time and attracted attention. Then we’d
                        have a group of children going into the warehouse every day alongside hulking Special Forces
                        commandos, which also would’ve attracted attention. But here on the lot, the props were all next
                        door, and anyone walking by will just think you’re making a film. And, to be blunt, since none
                        of you are famous, no one’s going to give you a second look.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That works for anyone walking by,” said Brooklyn. “But what about the people
                        at MI6, with the studio, and whoever’s working on the soundstage? Won’t they find out who we
                        are? Aren’t we supposed to be a secret?”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-142" class="calibre17">“There are exactly four people at MI6 who know about this
                        team,” said Tru. “And only two of us know Mother’s actual identity. Everyone else at Vauxhall
                        Cross thinks we’re making an educational film to be shown in schools across the UK. As for the
                        commandos, they think you’re training for a reality television series called <i
                            class="calibre8">The Spy’s the Limit</i>.” She glanced at
                        Mother. “I came up with that one myself.” She turned back to Brooklyn and said, “Trust me when I
                        say that your anonymity is secure.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Monty marveled at the cleverness of it all. “That’s bloody brilliant.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">Anyone can hide under darkness of night, but the cunning
                            one hides out in plain sight</i>,” recited Tru.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Ooh,” said Paris. “Is that another Motherism?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Motherism?” Tru turned to Mother. “Have you been taking credit for my
                        sayings?” She laughed and turned to the others. “That’s a Truism!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Tru showed them three separate sets: a small auditorium, a laboratory, and a
                        ballroom, each of which was a meticulous copy of a room in the Paris headquarters of Sinclair
                        Scientifica.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“These are the rooms where Stavros Sinclair is scheduled to make appearances
                        during the summit,” said Tru. “If you advance through the competition, you’ll be with him each
                        of those times. That means you’ll be our eyes and ears in these rooms, and I can’t emphasize
                        enough how vital that will be.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What happens if the Purple Thumb attacks?” asked Paris. “Are we supposed to
                        stop them?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No,” Mother interjected. “You’re to alert us to anything that’s going on so
                        that we can come crashing in. They’ve already killed two agents. We’re not putting you in harm’s
                        way for Stavros Sinclair.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-143" class="calibre17">“But you are our first line of defense,” Tru said,
                        sounding much less protective than Mother. “This week we’ll run through a wide variety of
                        simulations, and you’ll see there are scenarios where we think you can protect Stavros without
                        putting yourselves in too much danger.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother and Tru shared a look but neither said anything, and the phrase “too
                        much danger” hung in the air for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The auditorium is where Sinclair will deliver his address opening the summit,”
                        said Sydney. “And the lab’s where we’ll be working on the weather models, but what’s happening
                        in the ballroom?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“On the final night of the summit, the ballroom’s where the top ten teams will
                        assemble so he can announce the winner of the Stavros Challenge,” said Tru.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That explains these three rooms,” said Paris. “But what’s that one?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He pointed to the fourth set, which they hadn’t yet entered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let’s have a look,” said Tru. “Now, you have to understand that Stavros
                        Sinclair is extraordinarily secretive,” she said as they walked. “It took endless arm-twisting
                        to get the French authorities to release the blueprints to make these sets. And while we believe
                        they are exact, we don’t know for certain what’s in here.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They entered the set, which was made up as a computer server room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why don’t you know?” asked Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because the blueprints only show its structure, not what’s inside,” said Tru.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Then what makes you think it’s a server room?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-144" class="calibre17">“Air-conditioning,” she said. “There’s an excessive
                        number of vents coming into the room, as well as a pair of emergency air-conditioners directly
                        above it on the roof. Sinclair Scientifica uses massive computers that constantly need to be
                        cooled, so a server room makes the most sense.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Either that or they’ve got a penguin habitat,” joked Monty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Penguins are cute,” said Brooklyn, “but I’m hoping it’s computers.” She turned
                        to Tru. “What’s our mission in here?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not ours, pet, just yours,” she answered. “We want you to break in, hack into
                        the mainframe, and insert a program our top coders are concocting as we speak.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s barmy!” said Mother. “This was never part of the plan.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It is now,” said Tru. “In fact, it may be the most important part.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So now MI6 spies on companies?” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“This one, yes,” said Tru. “We’re quite concerned about some of the people
                        Sinclair Scientifica has been doing business with. We think they’ve been working alongside Umbra
                        in some instances. If we can get inside the mainframe, then we’ll know more about these people
                        and be able to do our job better. As secretive as the company is, this might be our best
                        chance.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Brooklyn’s only been here a few weeks,” Mother said. “She doesn’t have the
                        training for something like this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I seem to remember a phone call during which you told me she was a true
                        natural like you’d never seen,” said Tru. “I believe the phrase was ‘already better than the
                        other four.’ ”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This stung the others and put Mother on the defensive, which was exactly what
                        Tru wanted. She wasn’t concerned with niceties, only the mission.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Perhaps we can discuss this in private,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-145" class="calibre17">“Why? Because you’re worried about their feelings?” asked
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Mother. “Stop treating them like children.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“They are children,” he replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, they’re agents,” she said curtly. “As are you. I’m your uperior officer,
                        and this is your new directive.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s okay,” Brooklyn said, trying to calm the situation. “I should be able to
                        do this, no worries.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Tru smiled. “Excellent. Although, I assume the difficulty won’t be hacking the
                        computer so much as it will be getting into the room.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why’s that?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because, in order reach it, you’ll need to climb up two stories on the outside
                        of the building.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn tried to mask her reaction to this development. She hated heights.
                        Especially a er the night she’d spent locked on the roof of her foster home. At one point she’d
                        decided to climb to the ground, but when she saw the view over the edge, she instantly got dizzy
                        and backed away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">That same feeling of vertigo was in full force two days later as she dangled in
                        a climbing harness from the ceiling of the soundstage. The set designers had painstakingly
                        re-created a portion of the exterior wall of the Sinclair Scientifica building and Brooklyn was
                        trying to make it from one spot to another using nothing more than the mortar joints between
                        bricks, a rain gutter, and some windowsills.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">In all, she had to cover a distance of twenty-two feet, but after two
                        twelve-hour days the farthest she’d made it was nine.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre17">“I’m sorry,” she said as her hand slipped and she fell
                        for the umpteenth time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s enough for today,” said her climbing coach, a female commando from the
                        Special Air Service. “We’ll pick up again first thing tomorrow.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn hung in the air with sweat dripping down her face and pain radiating
                        from every fingertip. Her body was happy for the break, but her heart and mind understood some
                        harsh realities. She had only five more days to get ready, and when she made the actual climb,
                        she’d be outside in the dark without a harness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Two hours later, she came back to practice by herself. Or at least she thought
                        she was alone. She was about five feet off the ground when a noise from behind startled her,
                        causing her to slip and slam her face against the wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Owww!” she wailed as she reached up to hold her quickly swelling lip. She
                        twisted around in the harness to see Rio.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Oh, that’s just perfect. Of course it’s you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What does that mean?” he asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Let me guess,” she said, her frustration rising. “You’re here to gloat. To
                        make fun of the American who can’t get anything right. Well, go ahead. Hit me with your best
                        shot.” She spread open her arms and swayed in the air.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s not why I’m here,” he said defensively.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No? Then why?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I came here to help you. You shouldn’t climb by yourself. You can get hurt.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right,” she said. “Because that’s what you like to do, help me,” she scoffed.
                        “The only thing you want to help me do is look foolish so you can get your revenge.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s not like that,” he said. “You’ve got me all wrong.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre17">“Really?” she replied. “Have you done one nice thing for
                        me since I arrived? Have you done anything to make me feel welcome?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I came here tonight,” he answered. “Right now. This is me helping you.
                        Welcoming you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I don’t believe you,” she said. “And frankly, I don’t have any time to waste.
                        I’ve got to practice this. So, why don’t you do one of your little magic tricks and make
                        yourself disappear?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Rio stormed out of the room, while Brooklyn turned back to face the wall and
                        started all over again. As she did, a fleeting thought occurred to her. <i class="calibre8">What
                            if he</i> had <i class="calibre8">been trying to help?</i></p>

                    <h2><strong>18. </strong>Le Fantôme</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">There were many in the</span> international law
                        enforcement and intelligence communities who were convinced Le Fantôme was not a real person.
                        They believed he was a creation of Umbra designed to distract anyone trying to unravel the
                        intricate layers of the criminal organization.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They believed this because they’d failed so miserably to capture him. In fact,
                        he was very real, and unlike the evil masterminds in spy movies who lived in island fortresses
                        protected by giant death rays, he spent most of his time in an apartment located in the
                        Montmartre neighborhood of Paris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He had other residences around the globe but considered this one home. He’d
                        chosen it not for any strategic value but because it once belonged to Pierre-Auguste Renoir, his
                        favorite artist. An original Renoir portrait of a young girl in a dark blue coat now hung in the
                        study above his desk. The painting was worth more than twenty million dollars, but its value to
                        Le Fantôme was sentimental, not financial. The girl in the picture reminded him of his twin
                        sister, who’d passed away when they were only eleven years old.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Amazingly, the Renoir wasn’t the most expensive item in the apartment. That
                        honor belonged to a silver case that held a deadly virus with no known antidote.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre17">French authorities believed it was impossible for someone
                        to steal the case and open it without destroying the contents. But that’s because they hadn’t
                        considered the possibility that the person who stole it might also own the company that
                        manufactured it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Opening the case was easy for Le Fantôme, just as it had been simple to disable
                        its hidden tracking mechanism. Once he confirmed that the virus was inside, he placed everything
                        in a wall safe that had also been manufactured by one of his many companies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Despite the fact that he’d spent years planning for this very day, there was no
                        urgency as he spread butter and jam on a fresh baguette he’d purchased from the corner bakery.
                        His most ambitious plot was hours from being set into motion. Still he approached the day as he
                        would any other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He sat by an open window, sipping his coffee, and imagined how Rue Cortot had
                        looked when Monsieur Renoir ate his breakfast here more than a century before. He took a bite
                        and started to read <i class="calibre8">Le Parisien.</i> The front page had multiple
                        stories about the Global Youth Summit on the Environment. One article mentioned that fi y
                        thousand young people from around the world were coming to Paris with the belief that in three
                        days’ time they could change the world.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Le Fantôme took another bite. <i class="calibre8">They have no idea how much
                            the world is going to change in the next three days,</i> he
                        thought to himself. <i class="calibre8">No idea at all.</i></p>

                    <h2><strong>19. </strong>The Eurostar</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Brooklyn stared out the window</span> at a landscape of
                        green, yellow, and brown as the Eurostar raced through the French countryside, going nearly 190
                        miles per hour. But her mind wasn’t on the beauty of the scenery or the impressiveness of the
                        sleek train moving through it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She simply could not stop thinking about the wall. During a week of training,
                        she had only made it to the top twice. There were, however, countless times she found herself
                        dangling in the safety harness, forearms aching, fingertips throbbing, a er yet another failed
                        attempt. What were the odds she’d be able to complete the climb with everything on the line?</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Additionally, there’d been extra pressure ever since Tru said Mother had
                        labeled her “a true natural … already better than the other four.” They never talked about it,
                        but she saw the resentment in their eyes and felt their contempt every time she failed to live
                        up to that standard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Directly across from her and riding backward, Sydney was in a similar funk as
                        she worked on the speech she was giving at the summit’s closing rally. In the past three weeks
                        she’d written eleven different versions and hated each one. She had a yellow legal pad in her
                        lap, and, as she took a crack at attempt number twelve, she mumbled variations of the first line
                        to herself trying to find the perfect words.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-151" class="calibre17"><i class="calibre8">It is time for us to act. … The time
                            has come for us to act. … We must act now before it is too late. … The world is in danger,
                            and
                            we must come together and act.</i> She thought each one was worse than
                        the last, and she punctuated this sentiment with a growl of frustration as she took her pen and
                        crossed through them all.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The two of them were so distracted, neither noticed Mother take the seat next
                        to Sydney. As he watched them, he was equally concerned and entertained. He was also a bit
                        dismayed. Despite their extensive training, they seemed completely unaware he was there. To
                        remedy this, he opened a small red canister of Pringles, took out a potato chip, and crunched it
                        as loudly as he could.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">This startled them both.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How long have you been sitting there?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He finished chewing and swallowed before answering, “Long enough to know that
                        something’s troubling you.” He looked across the table at Brooklyn. “Both of you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The only thing troubling me is that my speech is total rubbish,” said Sydney.
                        “Oh, and the fact that I have to deliver it at the base of the Eiffel Tower in front of tens of
                        thousands of people.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s a reasonable cause for concern.” He turned to Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">“What about you?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Nothing’s bothering me,” she said defensively.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Really?” he chuckled. “Then what were you thinking about as you stared out the
                        window?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Um … just what I read in this book.” She held up a biography of Stavros
                        Sinclair that she had bought in a bookstore at the train station before they left London. “I
                        thought it might help to know more about him.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Which is why you’ve made it all the way to …” He took the book from her and
                        opened it at the bookmark. “… page seven. We’ve been on the
                        train for almost two hours, and you’ve read seven pages. Must be riveting. Which part has you
                        deep in thought? The table of contents?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She gave him a guilty shrug.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I know you’re worried about the climb,” he said. “That’s also reasonable. But,
                        lucky for both of you, I’m quite skilled at problem-solving.” He popped another chip in his
                        mouth and chomped on it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How can you fix my speech?” wondered Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I thought you’d never ask.” He pulled a folded piece of paper out of his
                        pocket and handed it to her. “Read this.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sydney opened it and began to read aloud. “ ‘Some problems are so big they
                        can’t be solved by adults,’ ” she said. “ ‘Luckily, there are young people like us who are ready
                        to face the challenge.’ ” She looked up at him. “This is good. Did you write this?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He laughed. “No. You did. That’s version three from two and a half weeks ago.
                        It was good then, and it’s good now. Your problem isn’t your speech. You just need to have faith
                        in yourself.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Sydney continued to read the speech, and Mother turned his attention back to
                        Brooklyn. “And now you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I have plenty of faith in myself,” said Brooklyn. “I have total faith that I
                        will fall off the side of that building and let everyone down.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’ll do no such thing,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What makes you so sure?” she asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The fact that I’m calling off the climb,” he said. “The mission’s busy enough.
                        We don’t need it.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You can’t just call it off,” Brooklyn protested.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I just did,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What about Tru?” she asked. “She gave you an order. Actually, she called it a
                        <i class="calibre8">directive</i>, which sounds even more
                        official than an order.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre17">“Yes, but once we’re in the field, I’m the alpha, and
                        that means I decide what is and what isn’t part of the mission,” Mother said. “Besides, I can
                        handle Tru.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Would you be <i class="calibre8">handling</i> her if it was Sydney and not
                        me?” asked Brooklyn. “It only took her a couple tries to get to the top.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, but that’s because I spent years sneaking out of and back into the
                        Wallangarra School for Girls,” said Sydney. “I got so good at climbing, some of my friends
                        started calling me the Tree Frog.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Besides, it doesn’t matter,” said Mother. “Sydney doesn’t have your computer
                        skills, so she can’t hack into the mainframe.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Exactly,” said Brooklyn. “Only I can do that. Which means my inability to
                        climb the wall is the reason an important part of the mission is in jeopardy.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“You’re putting too much pressure on yourself,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s true,” said Sydney. “We wouldn’t have been able to go on this mission if
                        it wasn’t for you.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn appreciated the sentiment but still felt like she was letting down the
                        team. Mother was offering her a “get out of jail free” card, and, as tempting as that was, it
                        seemed like cheating.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Just then, Kat slid into the seat next to Brooklyn and said, “I’ve discovered a
                        fascinating anomaly.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There’s a sentence you don’t hear every day,” said Mother. “What is it?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">As Kat spoke, she looked directly at Mother and Sydney, almost as if Brooklyn
                        wasn’t there. “Since this mission is about protecting Stavros Sinclair from the Purple Thumb, I
                        thought I’d look for patterns in their past crime scenes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The police have been doing that for years,” said Mother. “And they’ve gotten
                        nowhere.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-154" class="calibre17">“That’s because they’re looking for similarities in the
                        crimes,” Kat replied. “They think that will help them figure out who’s committing them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And what did you do?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I looked for patterns in the victims.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">He leaned forward, intrigued by this approach. “Go on.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay, you’ve got three of them. Victims, that is. Each is a sponsor of the
                        summit, and each was attacked during the final rally,” Kat said. “Other than that, they have
                        almost no commonalities. Fenix is a small Swedish so ware firm that writes programs to help
                        recycling companies. Fūjin is one of the leading manufacturers of wind energy turbines in Japan.
                        And Fulgora is a Silicon Valley tech startup that develops batteries for electric cars.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“And the pattern is?” asked Mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Their names,” said Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Fenix, Fūjin, and Fulgora,” offered Brooklyn. “They all start with <i
                            class="calibre8">F</i>.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Yes, but that’s an insignificant coincidence,” Kat said, dismissing the
                        observation. “The key is the <i class="calibre8">meaning</i> of
                        their names. Fenix is the Swedish name for the mythological firebird that rises from the ashes.
                        Fūjin is the Japanese god of wind. And Fulgora is the Roman goddess of lightning.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“So you think the Purple Thumb is … <i class="calibre8">anti-mythology</i>?”
                        Sydney asked, totally confused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“No, ignore the Purple Thumb and focus on the victims,” said Kat. “I think
                        Fenix, Fūjin, and Fulgora are all separate parts of the same company. One that likes to name
                        things after gods and other mythological creatures. I think the three victims are actually one
                        victim.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-155" class="calibre17">Mother considered this for a moment. “That would mean
                        instead of random vandalism, the Purple Thumb is targeting a single company,” he said.
                        “Interesting if it’s true, but that’s a pretty big leap to take just based on their names.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s no leap at all,” said Kat. She opened a picture on her computer tablet
                        and handed it across the table to Mother and Sydney. Brooklyn leaned across to get a look. “This
                        is from the crime scene in Stockholm.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s the purple thumbprint on the CEO’s computer monitor,” said Sydney. “We’ve
                        looked at it a hundred times.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“True, but we never considered the Asset Inventory Code,” said Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“How silly of us,” Mother joked. “What’s the Asset Inventory Code?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s the way companies keep track of the things they own, like computers,
                        furniture, and office equipment,” Kat explained.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Mother laughed. “And you know this because …?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Because she’s Kat,” said Sydney. “She knows everything about codes.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat smiled, a bit embarrassed, and said, “It’s the key to everything. Look at
                        the sticker.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">The computer had a sticker on which was printed:</p>
                    <p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre16"><b class="calibre14">FENIX</b></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre16"><b class="calibre14">SS2K FE13 A3C2 D1PK</b></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” Mother said, still not getting it. “What qualifies that as intriguing?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“It’s sixteen characters long,” said Kat. “Do you know how many different
                        combinations there are in a sixteen-character alphanumeric code?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m guessing rather a lot,” said Mother.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-156" class="calibre17">“Slightly less than eight septillion,” she said. “That’s
                        eight followed by twenty-four zeros.” She let this sink in before adding, “But there are fewer
                        than forty employees at Fenix, which makes you wonder: How many different pieces of office
                        furniture do you think they’re planning to buy?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Right,” said Mother. “My interest is officially piqued. What else do you
                        have?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I was able to find AIC codes from each of the crime scenes,” said Kat. “All
                        three companies use sixteen-character coding systems, and in all three of them the first four
                        characters are identical.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">She showed them the police photos and zoomed in so they could see what she was
                        talking about.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Each one starts off with S-S-2-K,” she continued. “There are nearly one
                        million, six hundred eighty thousand different combinations of the first four characters. The
                        chances the same combination would be at each location are astronomical.” She paused for a
                        moment. “Unless it’s all one company with one coding system. Then it makes total sense.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Boom!” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Once I knew that, I started deciphering more of the string,” continued Kat.
                        “The second set of characters tells you the location. Everything at Fenix has FE13: <i
                            class="calibre8">F-E</i>, the first
                        two letters of ‘Fenix,’ which was founded in 2013. And no matter where they were, all of the
                        computers have A3C at the start of the third group. That’s true of the computers in Tokyo, San
                        Francisco, and Stockholm. It has to be one company.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“I’m beyond convinced,” Mother said, marveling at it. “I don’t suppose you
                        figured out which company owns them all.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Brooklyn interrupted and said, “Sinclair Scientifica!”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre17">“Correct,” Kat replied as if she’d just noticed that
                        Brooklyn was also at the table. “How’d you know that?”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“We’ve just spent seven days learning everything we possibly ould about their
                        headquarters in Paris,” said Brooklyn. “A building that’s called … Olympus.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Home of the gods,” said Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Not only that,” Brooklyn said, happy to be noticed, “but the first four
                        characters are S-S-2-K. My guess is that stands for Sinclair Scientifica, which was founded on
                        January 1, 2000.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">They were all surprised by this revelation, especially Kat. Brooklyn held up
                        the biography and said, “That part’s on page three.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">Kat studied her for a moment and nodded. “That’s sound deductive reasoning.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre17">From Kat, that felt like a five-star review, and Brooklyn beamed. Through the
                        window they could see the outskirts of Paris as they neared the Gare du Nord train station.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Why would Sinclair Scientifica keep their ownership of these companies a
                        secret?” asked Sydney.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“There are a lot of reasons,” said Mother. “Some companies do it to avoid
                        government regulation and others to keep their competitors in the dark. There are endless
                        secrets in the business world.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“Well, somebody knew this one,” said Kat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean?” asked Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“The Purple Thumb,” she answered. “Whoever’s committing these crimes knows
                        they’re all part of one company. Maybe that’s why they’re doing it: to send a message. To let
                        Sinclair know they’re onto them.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“That’s extraordinary, Kat,” said Mother. “I don’t know if anyone else could’ve
                        found that pattern.”</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre17">“It has a flaw, though,” said Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“What flaw?” Kat asked defensively.</p>
                    <p class="calibre17">“One crime scene doesn’t fit,” Brooklyn answered. “The two dead agents floating
                        in the Seine. It wasn’t an attack on Sinclair, and it wasn’t during the summit. Why did the
                        Purple Thumb break their pattern? And what are they going to do with the stolen virus?”</p>
