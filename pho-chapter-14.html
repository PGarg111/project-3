                <h3>Chapter 14</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">Once outside, the silence is comforting and warm, like a good bowl of wonton soup on
                    a rainy day. I feel Bảo’s heat beside me, my hand a whisper away from his. During the summer, with
                    tourists flooding in, this part of the neighborhood gets packed with squatting old Vietnamese women,
                    dressed in countryside out ts. It’s not as heavy as Bolsa Avenue tra c, especially when the night
                    market’s up, but it’s still a tourist trap. You’re likely to get bullied into buying jackfruit in
                    Styrofoam trays, rambutan or longan, or&mdash;if the woman’s a <i class="calibre5">really good</i>
                    seller&mdash;durian. Sometimes I wonder if they ever sell all of their items, and when that doesn’t
                    happen, where they go.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The sight of Bảo passing under a lamplight stops me. It’s as if he’s just stepped
                    into a Caravaggio painting. The light throws o shadows, darkening half of his body. The lines of his
                    face seem sharper.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What?” Bảo brushes his hand through his hair. “Do I have something on my face?”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Nothing. The lighting. It was just perfect for a second.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You notice things like that?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I shrug, embarrassed that I was caught staring this time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bảo hops on a nearby cinder block wall, walking down the length before jumping
                    down, back at my side again. “Remember that bowl of phở? How bad it was? It’s probably from&mdash;”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Phở Bác Hồ. My parents hated that place.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Same.” At least our parents seem to agree on one thing&mdash;a universal distaste
                    for anything that refers to Hồ Chí Minh in name. Reminds them too much of the war. The owners made
                    some poor excuse when they opened&mdash;saying they were referring to an elderly relative. But you
                    have to be so ignorant to open something like that here. It closed not long after me and Bảo met.
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre12">“But I never got to see you draw Spider-Man, did I?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Because of our parents.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Something passes in his eyes that makes me shiver. “Did you ever think about what
                    it would have been like if our restaurants weren’t competing against each other?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It’s a loaded question to wrap up our time together, but I answer as honestly as I
                    can.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I think I thought about the idea of you, if that makes sense. But this is different. I finally get a chance to know you&mdash;and you seem nice.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Don’t worry, the nice-guy act disappears once we meet for the fourth time.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Great. I was really sensing asshole vibes back there.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It feels like an hour before we finally get to Ward Street, where our paths diverge.
                    This is what I’ll remember: his bashful wave and the shadows swallowing him up as he heads home.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">When I’m inside the house, only Ba is up. Back problems, most likely. I can smell
                    the Bengay emanating from him again. He sits in the dark living room, TV on, but with the cable o .
                    The static from the screen lights up his sleeping face, a hypnotizing pattern.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, <i class="calibre5">con về rồi</i>?” he asks groggily, stating the obvious.
                    “How was studying?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Dạ</i>. It went well.” The lie leaves me a bit too easily,
                    though I feel the weight of it in my stomach. But it has to be done. I take o my shoes, then make my
                    way to my bedroom. “The test will be easy. Now go to sleep.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ah.” I’ll give him two more hours before he drags himself to bed and wakes up
                    early to start his routine again.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">My mom’s knock wakes me up the next morning. My mouth’s parched, and the light
                    almost hurts my eyes. I remember that I didn’t drink any water after drinking boba. Is it possible
                    to be hungover from too much boba?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre12">I hear Mẹ lightly pad across my room. Her shampoo&mdash;Head
                    &amp; Shoulders, which she shares with Ba&mdash;tickles my nose. The bed sags just a bit when she
                    sits by me, patting my side. This was how she’d wake me and Evie up before heading o to a long day
                    at the restaurant.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Con, dậy đi. Chín giờ rồi</i>,” she whispers, her voice as
                    smooth as the glide of a brushstroke across a well-primed canvas.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I twist my head to the right and check the actual time: eight o’clock, instead of
                    an hour later like she just said.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Five more minutes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mẹ just made <i class="calibre5">bánh patê sô</i>. Just hot out of the oven. It’s
                    only good when it’s eaten hot.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I breathe in hints of her promise. Buttery pu pastry. Tender, flavorful chicken at
                    the center. And then my ultimate favorite: earthy Vietnamese co ee just waiting to be paired o with
                    sweetened condensed milk.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Okay, I’m up.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ knows she has me. I hear a smile in her voice. “See you soon.”</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">Once in the kitchen, I see that it’s not just pastry or co ee that she’s made. She
                    must be experimenting with recipes. Several pots are cooking on the stove, and on the outside patio,
                    there are two larger pots, which tells me whatever she’s cooking there might stink up the house.
                    Various herbs are soaking in tubs of water. At last ve bottles and jars of <i class="calibre5">gia
                        vị</i> are opened on the kitchen table. Ever-methodical in the restaurant kitchen, she’s the
                    complete opposite in our own kitchen.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Still, I love mornings like this.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The pastry is waiting just for me. I sink my teeth into it, fakes falling into my
                    lap. Mẹ has me taste the co ee and milk level, then pours ice over it. As Mẹ busies herself around
                    the kitchen, I FaceTime Evie, who complains that while other parents have sent their kids care
                    packages, Mẹ and Ba haven’t.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Care package, what is that?” Mẹ asks&mdash;or shouts, as the blender breaks down
                    some spices. Evie quickly explains the concept, to which Mẹ says that Vietnamese food, the good
                    kind, can’t ever be mailed.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre12">Meanwhile my hands are getting tired holding the phone so they
                    can see each other.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What about <i class="calibre5">bánh tai heo</i>? I’m craving it.” My sister loves
                    eating pig ears. Not real pig ears, but sugary biscuits that are shaped like them.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Okay, if you want, I will make them.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Don’t do it if you’re too busy.” She points out that Mẹ shouldn’t be cooking on
                    her day o . “Weekends are for fun. For people to do a hobby or something.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, like gardening,” I say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No way. Every time Mẹ tries to grow something, she kills it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Something is wrong with our soil,” Mẹ protests lightly as she grabs something from
                    the drawer.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Evie and I exchange knowing looks. Makes me feel like she’s not hours away. In our
                    small backyard, there’s a graveyard of plants Mẹ tried to grow: tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers. The
                    only thing that has survived are herbs, though it’s only a small selection.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sure, Mẹ. Sure.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Evie says she’s going on a run next and would text later. Once she’s gone, Mẹ asks
                    me worriedly, “Does she sound happy? Does she look thinner to you? Maybe she doesn’t have enough to
                    eat.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">When we moved Evie into the dorms, we had more food than anything else for her.
                    Luckily her roommate is Filipino, so she and her parents merely congratulated my parents on their
                    preparedness. Then Ba told them to stop by our restaurant if they were ever in the area. That was
                    when Evie decided it was time to say goodbye.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mẹ, she’s ne. She seems really happy. Don’t worry.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">“Mà Mẹ là Mẹ. Mẹ phải lo.”</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">I get up from the table, finished with breakfast. I hug my mom from behind. “Yeah,
                    but Evie’s got this. She can take care of herself. You know how she is.” At that, Mẹ only sighs
                    deeply, and my body mimics the movement.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Do you miss her?” she asks me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sometimes.” And that’s the truth of it. I thought it’d be much weirder to go home
                    to a half-empty bedroom. But over the past few weeks, I’ve gotten used to it. I think of my aunt and
                    the packages she sends Mẹ. I look at her longingly staring out the window over the sink, the light
                    showing that Mẹ seems to have a few more gray hairs than I remember. “Do you miss Dì Vàng?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre12">“Sometimes,” she says quietly. She doesn’t elaborate, and I’m
                    wondering if she’s going into one of her moods.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I let go and ask if I can help with anything.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, there’s too much to do. I should do it myself. Why don’t you do your homework
                    and if you have finished, go to your <i class="calibre5">hobby</i>,” Mẹ says, trying to mimic the way
                    Evie says it, but she ends up sounding nasally.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I bite my tongue, feeling like that’s how my parents will always see painting for
                    me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It’s just a suggestion, she probably thinks nothing of it, but the easy dismissal
                    of my hobby makes the taste of <i class="calibre5">patê sô</i> linger uncomfortably on my tongue.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You really should nd something else to do, Mẹ. You work too much.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“And work is good. Work makes money.” As she opens the blender to peer at its
                    contents, she says, “I haven’t had a hobby since I was a teenager. Your age.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What did you like to do?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A wistful look passes through her eyes. “Travel. When I wasn’t at school or helping
                    out around the house, I’d go around Nha Trang to places I’d never been. I would travel to Saigon and
                    Đà Lạt. Oh, Đà Lạt was so beautiful! So romantic!” She laughs. “And when we escaped, my rst wish was
                    that we’d land somewhere in Europe.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Have you traveled since?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, no. Where was the money? <i class="calibre5">Đời sống đã rất là khó.</i> I had
                    to work in factories, the nail salon, wherever I could get work. School wasn’t a priority since we
                    needed money. Traveling was a foolish idea. An impossible idea.” She shakes her head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That is why I’m happy to see Evie nd her way. She will live a life that’s not <i
                        class="calibre5">khó</i>. Unlike I had. Unlike your aunt.” Her tone shifts to one of
                    disapproval. “And soon enough you will have a good life too.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">A good life.</i> A good life only comes if you have
                    security&mdash;that’s what my mom’s basically saying. Anything beyond that is just a pipe dream.</p>
