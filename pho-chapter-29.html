                <h3>Chapter 29</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">The weather is dreary and gray, but it bodes well for tonight, my mom proclaims. It
                    means rain is coming&mdash;the perfect excuse for <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">At home in our kitchen, my mom woke up early to prep. I shu e into the kitchen in
                    my sweats, trying to compute what my eyes are seeing. On every surface available&mdash;the table,
                    the counters, the top of our rice cooker&mdash;sit metal food buckets, each holding the food items
                    that would go in each batch of <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>: shrimp, pork belly, bean sprouts,
                    and more. I see another batter that’s not as yellow; it might be the desserts she’s trying out,
                    something that resembles a crepe, ready for xings of strawberry, Nutella, and banana.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ comes in from outside, raincoat on, her pj’s underneath. She shakes out her wet
                    hair. From her morning shower or from outside, I’m not sure. Behind her on the outside stove,
                    whatever’s inside the pan sizzles and pops.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Need help?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No touching,” Mẹ answers tersely. She tries to clean but all she’s really doing is
                    moving from one bucket to the next. I haven’t seen her fretting like this since she found out about
                    the Mais’ rst Phở Day. And it all makes sense.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mẹ, are you nervous?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Nervous? Mẹ not nervous.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What’s the Vietnamese word for ‘nervous’?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Lo lắng</i>, but Mẹ not <i class="calibre5">lo lắng</i>,” my
                    mom counters. “<i class="calibre5">Chết cha</i>.” She does a double take toward the outdoor stove,
                    cursing when she sees something I can’t. I watch from inside as she scoops the batter from the pan
                    and dumps it onto a plate&mdash;with other failed attempts, I guess.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mẹ,” I say rmly once she gets back in. “What can I do?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre12">Mẹ sighs and glances down at her bowl half full of batter.
                    “I’ve done a couple of batters. But something is not right. I’m about to put in another layer right
                    now. Here, let’s use another pan. Everything else is almost cooked.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She lets the pan sit for a few seconds over the fire before instructing me to douse
                    it with two bottle-squirts of oil. She adds shrimp and pork belly. After waiting a couple more
                    beats, using her chopsticks to mix the batter, she deftly pours in a thin layer and it slides into
                    the pan with a satisfying sizzle.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s tricky, getting the layer just right,” Mẹ says, adding in bean sprouts. “Too
                    much and it won’t be crispy. <i class="calibre5">Không giòn</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How do you know when it’s crispy?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“The edges look as if they want to peel off.” Seconds pass and she has her spatula
                    ready. She folds the pancake in half, the other side golden brown. I grin. If she were in Chef Lê’s
                    kitchen, he’d probably be praising her. <i class="calibre5">This is the shit</i>, he’d say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> slides off easily onto the plate that I’m
                    holding. The rain has let up, but water from the gutter drips by my feet. I’m about to head inside
                    again to actually get a raincoat, when I hear Mẹ speaking.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I used to love <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> as a child. During the monsoon
                    seasons. Your uncle and I would eat this up whenever our parents made them,” she says. “We would
                    leave the door open and watch the rain from the kitchen.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Cậu Cam?” The uncle who I resembled. The one who didn’t make it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“When I cook things like this, I remember him. I’m sure he’d be surprised by how
                    good of a cook I’ve become. He was always so critical of my skills,” she says fondly.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">After a moment, realizing that’s all she’s going to say, I mention, “<i
                        class="calibre5">Everyone</i> says your <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> is the best one, you
                    know.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ tsks, pretending to shun the idea. “I wish people will say that to my face.” But
                    she smiles at me, her hood covering most of her face. I know her, though; I know she likes to hear
                    praise like this. She glances up at the sky, watching for something I can’t see. “I’m hoping the
                    rain doesn’t make everyone stay inside. If so, both restaurants might lose, which can’t be helped.
                    But until then, we think this deal will get a lot of customers. Even more than <i
                        class="calibre5">that</i> restaurant.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Later at the restaurant, Linh texts me.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-188" class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">how are you
                            doing?</b></span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13">you spying on us?</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">why do you think I kissed
                            you?</b></span></p>
                >br>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13">i knew it</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">thinking about you</b></span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="calibre12">I look over my shoulder. My mom’s busy cleaning up.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13">me too</span></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">also you’re going down
                            tonight</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13">oh, it’s going to be like
                            that?</span></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">game on</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">After a few hours of prepping, service is about to begin. The line doesn’t compare
                    to Linh’s, not at this hour, but still, there are people waiting outside the restaurant, umbrellas
                    up. So far, no one looks upset that they’re in the rain. Ba walks down the line, handing out menus
                    for consideration and even some samples of <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>. One guy takes a bite
                    and says, “<i class="calibre5">Dude</i>. This is the best thing I’ve ever tasted. Even my mom
                    doesn’t make it this good.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I only saw the back of my dad’s head, so I have to imagine his reaction to being
                    called a “dude.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Game on, man,” Việt says, standing right next to me as he ties his apron strings
                    behind his back. He was here earlier with us, his parents tagging along as they dropped off a fresh
                    batch of shrimp for tonight’s service.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">In the furry of everything, I remember that Việt doesn’t know about me and Linh yet.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How’s the bet with Ali going?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No changes from last time.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I don’t think it’s necessary anymore.” After making sure no one’s nearby, I tell
                    Việt everything about my visit to Linh in the art room, my note to her, and then our meetup at Chef
                    Lê’s place and our decision to test out our relationship.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-189" class="calibre12">Clearly, I catch him off guard; he blinks but doesn’t say
                    anything for a few beats. Suddenly, he’s thumping me on the back&mdash;channeling Chef Lê’s strength
                    &mdash;congratulating me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“And there’s no better way to test a relationship than competition.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Thanks for the reminder, Việt.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Personally, I don’t think anyone can really win. Both restaurants are doing different specials, so it’s going to draw different people. Don’t tell your mom I said this, though. She
                    wouldn’t like it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Who wouldn’t like what?” Mẹ asks, appearing behind us as she dons a pair of
                    kitchen gloves. “Why are you talking instead of working?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Nothing, we’re just wondering if anyone’s ever going to make <i
                        class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> the way you do. What if the other restaurant tries to copy us?”
                    Việt answers, so sweetly that Mẹ might see through him.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ doesn’t even bat an eyelash as she says, “They’re no good at making <i
                        class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’ve had theirs before or something?” I ask, surprised that she would know how
                    it tasted. Or at least it sounds like it. She used to call their other foods bland, especially the
                    phở, and I always thought it was an assumption on her part. A way to mock them.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ waves her hand. “I just know it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh.” Her quick answer bothers me, though. It’s more of a feeling than anything.
                    But there isn’t time to think about it more, because Ba is shouting for us to get into formation up
                    front and seat everyone he’s about to let in.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">The deal started out as a combination special&mdash;phở plus a free mini pancake. It
                    was going ne until the first ticket for one complete order of <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>
                    emerges, and then another, and then another. Soon enough, we find tables ordering <i
                        class="calibre5">only</i> pancakes and not phở.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The customers are mostly Việt, with a few stragglers who probably spotted a flyer at a Vietnamese market.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre12">One woman&mdash;strikingly blond&mdash;with a hint of some
                    European accent asks me to describe <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> to her. She’s in charge of
                    ordering for her family of ve who look the most out of place in the restaurant&mdash;and I’m
                    guessing Bolsa in general.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Have you ever had a crepe?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Well this is kind of a like a crepe, except it’s mostly savory. Think about the
                    crispiest thing you’ve ever eaten. Got it?” The customer nods, looking like she’s hanging on to my
                    every word. I feel suddenly powerful, and I go with this feeling.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re sitting outside under a storefront’s umbrella. It’s raining, but not
                    pouring, and you can smell soil, gasoline from a motorbike just passing through. Someone places this
                    bright yellow pancake in front of you. It has turmeric, juicy pork belly, soft prawns, and crunchy
                    bean sprouts tucked inside, and you drizzle salty and spicy fish sauce all over it. One bite… and
                    you’re gone.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The customer blinks twice and sits back. “You sold me. One for everyone at the
                    table.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You won’t regret it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Back in the kitchen, I hand over my slip to Mẹ, who does a double take. “Five?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Five,” I repeat with a wide grin.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Did you tell them we put gold in it or something?” she mutters. I catch a hint of
                    a smile as she turns back toward the kitchen line to bark an order.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">Over the years, my parents have had to deal with various levels of nasty customers.
                    Abhorrent. Unconscionable. Sometimes, the criticism comes from other Vietnamese people. The broth’s
                    too bland or the egg rolls haven’t been cooked enough or the <i class="calibre5">nước mắm</i>
                    doesn’t have enough lime. Mẹ’s quick to have a word with them, her voice turning firm when she’s
                    speaking in her language. By the end, they always agree to disagree about the recipes.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre12">“Every Vietnamese person is different. Our family may be different according to region.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But some customers are on a different level. Like today.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Around four in the afternoon, Việt comes up to me by the service window looking,
                    for once, concerned.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What’s up with you?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Dude, it’s ridiculous. Some guy’s saying we haven’t given him enough egg rolls.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How many did he order?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“One side.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“And we gave him two?” At Việt’s nod, I ask, “So what’s the deal?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“He doesn’t believe me, thinks we’re scamming him. He wants to speak to the
                    manager.” I hesitate then. That would be my mom. It’s ne for my mom to berate Vietnamese
                    customers&mdash;somehow she manages to win them over by cracking a joke or two, then she gives them
                    an extra side of something. But in English, she’s different. I can see it in her face when she
                    struggles to find the right word, the right retort. It’s one of her biggest insecurities. Then she
                    loses her cool, getting angry mostly at herself.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I search the room and nd the trouble immediately. His face is sunburned and he has
                    his sunglasses on top of his head. His hair’s all spiked up. While he waits for attention, he leans
                    back, arms crossed, fingers tapping away his impatience. It looks like he’s with his wife or
                    girlfriend and their kids. The woman’s leaning in, whispering something, but he just stares straight
                    ahead, jaw clenched. I wonder how the kids must be feeling.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ makes her way from the front desk to the table&mdash;and steps back when the man
                    rises slowly. He towers over her in a way that reminds me that my mom’s actually under five feet. It’s
                    always her voice and manner that make her seem taller than she is.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Shit. I have a bad feeling about this.” Việt and I get closer to the table.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“&mdash;if you’re dissatisfied with the taste of it, we will happily make another
                    order for you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Jared,” the woman next to him whispers. “Let’s just have our meal. It’s ne.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-192" class="calibre12">“It’s <i class="calibre5">not</i>fine, Beth.” He looks down at
                    my mom. “I wanna know why you’re scamming us.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“A scam?” Mẹ asks.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What, that word not clicking for you? Do you even know English?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What the fuck, man,” Việt whispers to me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mister,” Mẹ starts over, regulating her voice. She speaks slowly, but clearly, “We
                    always serve two egg rolls for each order. Look around at the other tables.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She gestures to other tables, where customers have stopped eating or are trying not
                    to look interested in the drama. The man can’t help but look around too, and he lets his arms fall
                    loose. From my place, I breathe out. There. It’s just a misunderstanding. He’s going to apologize
                    soon, and then everything will go okay.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But that doesn’t happen.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“This place is shit. Shitty food. Shitty owners who can’t even speak fucking
                    English.” His voice is booming and if the customers weren’t listening before, they’re listening now.
                    “I’m not paying for this,” Jared declares.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What&mdash;” My mom’s sputtering now, shocked by his declaration. As am I.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Before another word can be said, the guy forcefully pushes his chair in and barks
                    at his children to get up too, which they do, eyes on the ground. Embarrassed, maybe. I would be.
                    The little girl looks close to tears, even. “Hey,” I jump in. “That’s not cool, man. You already
                    ate, like, everything.” Which is true. The phở, the <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i>&mdash;save for
                    the side order of egg rolls&mdash;are all cleared. But my protest goes unheard. Beth scrabbles for
                    her purse hanging on her chair and almost hesitates to follow Jared. Mouth opening, then closing,
                    she finally heads toward the door.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m the first to move. “What the hell!” I try moving past my mom, planning on calling
                    the police on them, or <i class="calibre5">something</i> that would make them pay, but Mẹ quickly
                    catches me by the wrist.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Con, it’s not worth it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m shaking with anger. “But&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We have to get back to work.” Mẹ gives me a hard look. “There are other customers
                    to take care of. This family won’t make a difference.” To the remaining customers, she turns and
                    smiles diplomatically. “Please, return to your meals. Sorry for the disturbance.” She repeats it in
                    Vietnamese.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre12">My mom saves her complaints about Jared and his family for
                    the kitchen. I’m sure this has happened before but it was the first time I’d seen it in person. I grew
                    up here, living around people who looked like me. We belonged to the same temple, our parents knew
                    each other. I didn’t expect to see someone from the outside look so sure of themselves as they
                    spouted hate.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I lean forward, elbows on a prep table, and say, “Do you think that guy’s going to
                    come back?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, I won’t let him.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Shouldn’t you report him?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“There’s many men like him. Are we going to report all of them?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, but…” I trail o ; I don’t have a real solution. I guess I just don’t like
                    the feeling of some guy treating my parents&mdash;and other owners in the area&mdash;like this. It
                    was more painful than hearing the waiter at photastic ask my dad to repeat himself. This guy
                    basically attacked them. “I don’t know, it just seems wrong.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We are not new to this,” Ba says shortly. “We have lived in other places before
                    Little Saigon. There are much worse people.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“He won’t come back, con. <i class="calibre5">Đồ quỷ</i>.” Somehow she makes swear
                    words sound like a natural part of our language.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“He’s an asshole,” I agree. Now she scolds me for using a bad word, but I press on.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Let’s get back to work.”</p>
