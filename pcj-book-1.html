          <h2>Chapter 1: I ACCIDENTALLY VAPORIZED MY PRE-ALGEBRA TEACHER</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">L</b></span></span></span> <span class="calibre5">OOK.</span> I <span
              class="calibre5">DIDN‚ÄôT WANT TO BE A HALF-BLOOD.</span> If you‚Äôre reading this because you think you might
            be one, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your
            birth, and try to lead a normal life.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Being a half-blood is dangerous. It‚Äôs scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in
            painful, nasty ways.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">If you‚Äôre a normal kid, reading this because you think it‚Äôs fiction, great. Read on. I
            envy
            you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But if you recognize yourself in these pages&mdash;if you feel something stirring
            inside&mdash;stop reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it‚Äôs only a matter of
            time before <i class="calibre7">they</i> sense it too, and they‚Äôll come for you.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1">My name is Percy Jackson.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy,
            a
            private school for troubled kids in upstate New York.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Am I a troubled kid?</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre17">Yeah. You could say that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things really
            started going bad last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to Manhattan&mdash;twenty-eight
            mental-case kids and two teachers on a yellow school bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look
            at
            ancient Greek and Roman stuff.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I know&mdash;it sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He had thinning hair and
            a
            scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be cool,
            but he told stories and joked and let us play games in class. He also had this awesome collection of Roman
            armor and weapons, so he was the only teacher whose class didn‚Äôt put me to sleep.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn‚Äôt get in
            trouble.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Boy, was I wrong.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">See, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade school, when we went
            to
            the Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasn‚Äôt aiming for the
            school
            bus, but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we took a
            behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit the wrong lever on the catwalk and our
            class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that‚Ä¶Well, you get the idea.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">This trip, I was determined to be good.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly, redheaded
            kleptomaniac
            girl, hitting my friend Grover in the back of the head with chunks of peanut-butter-and-ketchup sandwich.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He must‚Äôve
            been
            held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a wispy beard on
            his
            chin. On top of all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE for the rest of his life
            because
            he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs. He walked funny, like every step hurt him, but don‚Äôt let
            that fool you. You should‚Äôve seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Anyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly brown hair,
            and
            she knew I couldn‚Äôt do anything back to her because I was already on probation. The headmaster had
            threatened
            me with death by in-school suspension if anything bad, embarrassing, or even mildly entertaining happened on
            this trip.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-34" class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill her,‚Äù I mumbled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover tried to calm me down. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I like peanut butter.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He dodged another piece of Nancy‚Äôs lunch.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it.‚Äù I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already on probation,‚Äù he reminded me. ‚ÄúYou know who‚Äôll get blamed if anything
            happens.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Looking back on it, I wish I‚Äôd decked Nancy Bobofit right then and there. In-school
            suspension would‚Äôve been nothing compared to the mess I was about to get myself into.</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Mr. Brunner led the museum tour.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He rode up front in his wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey galleries, past
            marble statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three thousand years.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone column with a big sphinx on the top, and
            started telling us how it was a grave marker, a <i class="calibre7">stele</i>, for a girl about our age. He
            told us about the carvings on the sides. I was trying to listen to what he had to say, because it was kind
            of
            interesting, but everybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the other teacher
            chaperone, Mrs. Dodds, would give me the evil eye.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds was this little math teacher from Georgia who always wore
            a
            black leather jacket, even though she was fifty years old. She looked mean enough to ride a Harley right
            into
            your locker. She had come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous
            breakdown.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">From her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil spawn. She
            would
            point her crooked finger at me and say, ‚ÄúNow, honey,‚Äù real sweet, and I knew I was going to get after-school
            detention for a month.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">One time, after she‚Äôd made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until midnight, I
            told Grover I didn‚Äôt think Mrs. Dodds was human. He looked at me, real serious, and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely
            right.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele, and I turned
            around and said, ‚ÄúWill you <i class="calibre7">shut up</i>?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It came out louder than I meant it to.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The whole group laughed. Mr. Brunner stopped his story.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMr. Jackson,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúdid you have a comment?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My face was totally red. I said, ‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. ‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôll tell us what
            this
            picture represents?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually recognized it.
            ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Kronos eating his kids, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Mr. Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. ‚ÄúAnd he did this because‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù I racked my brain to remember. ‚ÄúKronos was the king god, and &mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGod?‚Äù Mr. Brunner asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTitan,‚Äù I corrected myself. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt trust his kids, who were the gods. So, um,
            Kronos ate them, right? But his wife hid baby Zeus, and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. And later, when
            Zeus grew up, he tricked his dad, Kronos, into barfing up his brothers and sisters&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúEeew!‚Äù said one of the girls behind me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú&mdash;and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,‚Äù I continued,
            ‚Äúand
            the gods won.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Some snickers from the group.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-38" class="calibre17">Behind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, ‚ÄúLike we‚Äôre going to
            use
            this in real life. Like it‚Äôs going to say on our job applications, ‚ÄòPlease explain why Kronos ate his
            kids.‚Äô‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd why, Mr. Jackson,‚Äù Brunner said, ‚Äúto paraphrase Miss Bobofit‚Äôs excellent question,
            does this matter in real life?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBusted,‚Äù Grover muttered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Nancy hissed, her face even brighter red than her hair.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">At least Nancy got packed, too. Mr. Brunner was the only one who ever caught her saying
            anything wrong. He had radar ears.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about his question, and shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Mr. Brunner looked disappointed. ‚ÄúWell, half credit, Mr. Jackson. Zeus did
            indeed
            feed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which made him disgorge his other five children, who, of course,
            being immortal gods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titan‚Äôs stomach. The gods
            defeated their father, sliced him to pieces with his own scythe, and scattered his remains in Tartarus, the
            darkest part of the Underworld. On that happy note, it‚Äôs time for lunch. Mrs. Dodds, would you lead us back
            outside?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing each other
            around
            and acting like doofuses.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and I were about to follow when Mr. Brunner said, ‚ÄúMr. Jackson.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I knew that was coming.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I told Grover to keep going. Then I turned toward Mr. Brunner. ‚ÄúSir?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. Brunner had this look that wouldn‚Äôt let you go&mdash;intense brown eyes that could‚Äôve
            been a thousand years old and had seen everything.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou must learn the answer to my question,‚Äù Mr. Brunner told me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAbout the Titans?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAbout real life. And how your studies apply to it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat you learn from me,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis vitally important. I expect you to treat it as
            such.
            I will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he dressed up in a suit of
            Roman
            armor and shouted: ‚ÄúWhat ho!‚Äù and challenged us, sword-point against chalk, to run to the board and name
            every
            Greek and Roman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god they worshipped. But Mr. Brunner
            expected me to be as good as everybody else, despite the fact that I have dyslexia and attention deficit
            disorder and I had never made above a C- in my life. No&mdash;he didn‚Äôt expect me to be <i
              class="calibre7">as
              good</i>; he expected me to be <i class="calibre7">better</i>. And I just couldn‚Äôt learn all those names
            and
            facts, much less spell them correctly.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre17">I mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr. Brunner took one
            long sad look at the stele, like he‚Äôd been at this girl‚Äôs funeral.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He told me to go outside and eat my lunch.</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>

          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1">The class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch the foot traffic
            along Fifth Avenue.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Overhead, a huge storm was brewing, with clouds blacker than I‚Äôd ever seen over the city.
            I
            figured maybe it was global warming or something, because the weather all across New York state had been
            weird
            since Christmas. We‚Äôd had massive snow storms, flooding, wildfires from lightning strikes. I wouldn‚Äôt have
            been surprised if this was a hurricane blowing in.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Nobody else seemed to notice. Some of the guys were pelting pigeons with Lunchables
            crackers. Nancy Bobofit was trying to pickpocket something from a lady‚Äôs purse, and, of course, Mrs. Dodds
            wasn‚Äôt seeing a thing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and I sat on the edge of the fountain, away from the others. We thought that maybe
            if we did that, everybody wouldn‚Äôt know we were from <i class="calibre7">that</i> school&mdash;the school
            for
            loser freaks who couldn‚Äôt make it elsewhere.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDetention?‚Äù Grover asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNot from Brunner. I just wish he‚Äôd lay off me sometimes. I mean&mdash;I‚Äôm
            not a genius.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover didn‚Äôt say anything for a while. Then, when I thought he was going to give me some
            deep philosophical comment to make me feel better, he said, ‚ÄúCan I have your apple?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt have much of an appetite, so I let him take it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I watched the stream of cabs going down Fifth Avenue, and thought about my mom‚Äôs
            apartment,
            only a little ways uptown from where we sat. I hadn‚Äôt seen her since Christmas. I wanted so bad to jump in a
            taxi and head home. She‚Äôd hug me and be glad to see me, but she‚Äôd be disappointed, too. She‚Äôd send me right
            back to Yancy, remind me that I had to try harder, even if this was my sixth school in six years and I was
            probably going to be kicked out again. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stand that sad look she‚Äôd give me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. Brunner parked his wheelchair at the base of the handicapped ramp. He ate celery
            while
            he read a paperback novel. A red umbrella stuck up from the back of his chair, making it look like a
            motorized
            caf√© table.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-41" class="calibre17">I was about to unwrap my sandwich when Nancy Bobofit appeared in
            front
            of me with her ugly friends&mdash;I guess she‚Äôd gotten tired of stealing from the tourists&mdash;and dumped
            her half-eaten lunch in Grover‚Äôs lap.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOops.‚Äù She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if
            somebody
            had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to stay cool. The school counselor had told me a million times, ‚ÄúCount to ten,
            get
            control of your temper.‚Äù But I was so mad my mind went blank. A wave roared in my ears.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I don‚Äôt remember touching her, but the next thing I knew, Nancy was sitting on her butt
            in
            the fountain, screaming, ‚ÄúPercy pushed me!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds materialized next to us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Some of the kids were whispering: ‚ÄúDid you see&mdash;</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú&mdash;the water&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú&mdash;like it grabbed her&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt know what they were talking about. All I knew was that I was in trouble again.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">As soon as Mrs. Dodds was sure poor little Nancy was okay, promising to get her a new
            shirt
            at the museum gift shop, etc., etc., Mrs. Dodds turned on me. There was a triumphant fire in her eyes, as if
            I‚Äôd done something she‚Äôd been waiting for all semester. ‚ÄúNow, honey&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-42" class="calibre17">‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I grumbled. ‚ÄúA month erasing workbooks.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That wasn‚Äôt the right thing to say.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome with me,‚Äù Mrs. Dodds said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Grover yelped.‚ÄúIt was me. <i class="calibre7">I</i> pushed her.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at him, stunned. I couldn‚Äôt believe he was trying to cover for me. Mrs. Dodds
            scared Grover to death.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She glared at him so hard his whiskery chin trembled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, Mr. Underwood,‚Äù she said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou&mdash;<i class="calibre7">will</i>&mdash;stay&mdash;here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover looked at me desperately.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, man,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúThanks for trying.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù Mrs. Dodds barked at me. ‚Äú<i class="calibre7">Now</i>.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Nancy Bobofit smirked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I gave her my deluxe I‚Äôll-kill-you-later stare. Then I turned to face Mrs. Dodds, but she
            wasn‚Äôt there. She was standing at the museum entrance, way at the top of the steps, gesturing impatiently at
            me to come on.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">How‚Äôd she get there so fast?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and the next
            thing
            I know I‚Äôve missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at the blank
            place behind it. The school counselor told me this was part of the ADHD, my brain misinterpreting things.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt so sure.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I went after Mrs. Dodds.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Halfway up the steps, I glanced back at Grover. He was looking pale, cutting his eyes
            between me and Mr. Brunner, like he wanted Mr. Brunner to notice what was going on, but Mr. Brunner was
            absorbed in his novel.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked back up. Mrs. Dodds had disappeared again. She was now inside the building, at
            the
            end of the entrance hall.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Okay, I thought. She‚Äôs going to make me buy a new shirt for Nancy at the gift shop.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But apparently that wasn‚Äôt the plan.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I followed her deeper into the museum. When I finally caught up to her, we were back in
            the
            Greek and Roman section.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-43" class="calibre17">Except for us, the gallery was empty.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds stood with her arms crossed in front of a big marble frieze of the Greek gods.
            She was making this weird noise in her throat, like growling.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Even without the noise, I would‚Äôve been nervous. It‚Äôs weird being alone with a teacher,
            especially Mrs. Dodds. Something about the way she looked at the frieze, as if she wanted to pulverize it‚Ä¶
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been giving us problems, honey,‚Äù she said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I did the safe thing. I said, ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She tugged on the cuffs of her leather jacket. ‚ÄúDid you really think you would get away
            with it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The look in her eyes was beyond mad. It was evil.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She‚Äôs a teacher, I thought nervously. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs going to hurt me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll&mdash;I‚Äôll try harder, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Thunder shook the building.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe are not fools, Percy Jackson,‚Äù Mrs. Dodds said. ‚ÄúIt was only a matter of time before
            we
            found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All I could think of was that the teachers must‚Äôve found the illegal stash of candy I‚Äôd
            been selling out of my dorm room. Or maybe they‚Äôd realized I got my essay on <i class="calibre7">Tom
              Sawyer</i> from the Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade.
            Or
            worse, they were going to make me read the book.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell?‚Äù she demanded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour time is up,‚Äù she hissed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then the weirdest thing happened. Her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals. Her fingers
            stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasn‚Äôt human. She was a
            shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was about to slice me to
            ribbons.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-45" class="calibre17">Then things got even stranger.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. Brunner, who‚Äôd been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his chair
            into
            the doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat ho, Percy!‚Äù he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds lunged at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched the
            ballpoint pen out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn‚Äôt a pen anymore. It was a sword&mdash;Mr.
            Brunner‚Äôs bronze sword, which he always used on tournament day.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She snarled, ‚ÄúDie, honey!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">And she flew straight at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally: I swung
            the
            sword.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she were made of
            water. <i class="calibre7">Hisss!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She exploded into yellow powder, vaporized
            on
            the spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the air, as if
            those two glowing red eyes were still watching me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was alone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was a ballpoint pen in my hand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. Brunner wasn‚Äôt there. Nobody was there but me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My hands were still trembling. My lunch must‚Äôve been contaminated with magic mushrooms or
            something.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Had I imagined the whole thing?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I went back outside.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It had started to rain.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was sitting by the fountain, a museum map tented over his head. Nancy Bobofit was
            still standing there, soaked from her swim in the fountain, grumbling to her ugly friends. When she saw me,
            she said, ‚ÄúI hope Mrs. Kerr whipped your butt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOur <i class="calibre7">teacher.</i> Duh!‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-46" class="calibre17">I blinked. We had no teacher named Mrs. Kerr. I asked Nancy what she
            was talking about.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She just rolled her eyes and turned away.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I asked Grover where Mrs. Dodds was.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He said, ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But he paused first, and he wouldn‚Äôt look at me, so I thought he was messing with me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot funny, man,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúThis is serious.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Thunder boomed overhead.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I saw Mr. Brunner sitting under his red umbrella, reading his book, as if he‚Äôd never
            moved.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I went over to him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He looked up, a little distracted. ‚ÄúAh, that would be my pen. Please bring your own
            writing
            utensil in the future, Mr. Jackson.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I handed Mr. Brunner his pen. I hadn‚Äôt even realized I was still holding it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs Mrs. Dodds?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He stared at me blankly. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-</p>
          <p class="calibre1">algebra teacher.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He frowned and sat forward, looking mildly concerned. ‚ÄúPercy, there is no Mrs. Dodds on
            this trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy. Are you feeling all right?‚Äù

          <h2>Chapter 2: THREE OLD LADIES KNIT THE SOCKS OF DEATH</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">I</b></span></span></span> <span class="calibre5">WAS USED TO THE OCCASIONAL
              WEIRD</span> experience, but usually they were over quickly. This twenty-four/seven hallucination was more
            than I could handle. For the rest of the school year, the entire campus seemed to be playing some kind of
            trick on me. The students acted as if they were completely and totally convinced that Mrs. Kerr&mdash;a
            perky
            blond woman whom I‚Äôd never seen in my life until she got on our bus at the end of the field trip&mdash;had
            been our pre-algebra teacher since Christmas.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Every so often I would spring a Mrs. Dodds reference on somebody, just to see if I could
            trip them up, but they would stare at me like I was a psycho.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It got so I almost believed them&mdash;Mrs. Dodds had never existed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Almost.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But Grover couldn‚Äôt fool me. When I mentioned the name Dodds to him, he would hesitate,
            then claim she didn‚Äôt exist. But I knew he was lying,</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Something was going on. Something <i class="calibre7">had</i> happened at the museum.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt have much time to think about it during the days, but at night, visions of Mrs.
            Dodds with talons and leathery wings would wake me up in a cold sweat.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-47" class="calibre17">The freak weather continued, which didn‚Äôt help my mood. One night, a
            thunderstorm blew out the windows on my dorm room. A few days later, the biggest tornado ever spotted in the
            Hudson Valley touched down only fifty miles from Yancy Academy. One of the current events we studied in
            social
            studies class was the unusual number of small planes that had gone down in sudden squalls in the Atlantic
            that
            year.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I started feeling cranky and irritable most of the time. My grades slipped from Ds to Fs.
            I
            got into more fights with Nancy Bobofit and her friends. I was sent out into the hallway in almost every
            class.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, when our English teacher, Mr. Nicoll, asked me for the millionth time why I was
            too lazy to study for spelling tests, I snapped. I called him an old sot. I wasn‚Äôt even sure what it meant,
            but it sounded good.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The headmaster sent my mom a letter the following week, making it official: I would not
            be
            invited back next year to Yancy Academy,</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Fine, I told myself. Just fine.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was homesick.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to be with my mom in our little apartment on the Upper East Side, even if I had
            to
            go to public school and put up with my obnoxious stepfather and his stupid poker parties.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">And yet‚Ä¶there were things I‚Äôd miss at Yancy. The view of the woods out my dorm window,
            the
            Hudson River in the distance, the smell of pine trees. I‚Äôd miss Grover, who‚Äôd been a good friend, even if he
            was a little strange. I worried how he‚Äôd survive next year without me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôd miss Latin class too&mdash;Mr. Brunner‚Äôs crazy tournament days and his faith that I
            could do well.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As exam week got closer, Latin was the only test I studied for. I hadn‚Äôt forgotten what
            Mr.
            Brunner had told me about this subject being life-and-death for me. I wasn‚Äôt sure why, but I‚Äôd started to
            believe him.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
          <p class="calibre1">The evening before my final, I got so frustrated I threw the <i class="calibre7">Cambridge
              Guide to Greek Mythology</i> across my dorm room. Words had started swimming off the page, circling my
            head,
            the letters doing one-eighties as if they were riding skateboards. There was no way I was going to remember
            the difference between Chiron and Charon, or Polydictes and Polydeuces. And conjugating those Latin verbs?
            Forget it.
          <p id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre17">I paced the room, feeling like ants were crawling around inside my
            shirt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I remembered Mr. Brunner‚Äôs serious expression, his thousand-year-old eyes. <i
              class="calibre7">I will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took a deep breath. I picked up the mythology book. I‚Äôd never asked a teacher for help
            before. Maybe if I talked to Mr. Brunner, he could give me some pointers. At least I could apologize for the
            big fat F I was about to score on his exam. I didn‚Äôt want to leave Yancy Academy with him thinking I hadn‚Äôt
            tried.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I walked downstairs to the faculty offices. Most of them were dark and empty, but Mr.
            Brunner‚Äôs door was ajar, light from his window stretching across the hallway floor.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was three steps from the door handle when I heard voices inside the office. Mr. Brunner
            asked a question. A voice that was definitely Grover‚Äôs said ‚Äú‚Ä¶worried about Percy, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I froze.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôm not usually an eavesdropper, but I dare you to try not listening if you hear your
            best
            friend talking about you to an adult.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I inched closer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú‚Ä¶alone this summer,‚Äù Grover was saying. ‚ÄúI mean, a Kindly One in the <i
              class="calibre7">school</i>! Now that we know for sure, and <i class="calibre7">they</i> know too&mdash;‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe would only make matters worse by rushing him,‚Äù Mr. Brunner said. ‚ÄúWe need the boy to
            mature more.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut he may not have time. The summer solstice deadline&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWill have to be resolved without him, Grover. Let him enjoy his ignorance while he still
            can.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSir, he <i class="calibre7">saw</i> her‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHis imagination,‚Äù Mr. Brunner insisted. ‚ÄúThe Mist over the students and staff will be
            enough to convince him of that.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSir, I‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt fail my duties again.‚Äù Grover‚Äôs voice was choked with emotion. ‚ÄúYou know
            what that would mean.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt failed, Grover,‚Äù Mr. Brunner said kindly. ‚ÄúI should have seen her for what
            she
            was. Now let‚Äôs just worry about keeping Percy alive until next fall&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The mythology book dropped out of my hand and hit the floor with a thud.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. Brunner went silent.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My heart hammering, I picked up the book and backed down the hall.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-50" class="calibre17">A shadow slid across the lighted glass of Brunner‚Äôs office door, the
            shadow of something much taller than my wheelchair-bound teacher, holding something that looked suspiciously
            like an archer‚Äôs bow.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I opened the nearest door and slipped inside.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A few seconds later I heard a slow <i class="calibre7">clop-clop-clop,</i> like muffled
            wood blocks, then a sound like an animal snuffling right outside my door. A large, dark shape paused in
            front
            of the glass, then moved on.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A bead of sweat trickled down my neck.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Somewhere in the hallway, Mr. Brunner spoke. ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúMy nerves haven‚Äôt
            been right since the winter solstice.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMine neither,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúBut I could have sworn‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGo back to the dorm,‚Äù Mr. Brunner told him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a long day of exams tomorrow.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remind me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The lights went out in Mr. Brunner‚Äôs office.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I waited in the dark for what seemed like forever.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, I slipped out into the hallway and made my way back to the dorm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was lying on his bed, studying his Latin exam notes like he‚Äôd been there all
            night.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, bleary-eyed. ‚ÄúYou going to be ready for this test?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt answer.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou look awful.‚Äù He frowned. ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶tired.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned so he couldn‚Äôt read my expression, and started getting ready for bed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôd heard downstairs. I wanted to believe I‚Äôd imagined the whole
            thing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But one thing was clear: Grover and Mr. Brunner were talking about me behind my back.
            They
            thought I was in some kind of danger.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
          <p class="calibre1">The next afternoon, as I was leaving the three-hour Latin exam, my eyes swimming with all
            the Greek and Roman names I‚Äôd misspelled, Mr. Brunner called me back inside.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For a moment, I was worried he‚Äôd found out about my eavesdropping the night before, but
            that didn‚Äôt seem to be the problem.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be discouraged about leaving Yancy. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs for the best.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His tone was kind, but the words still embarrassed me. Even though he was speaking
            quietly,
            the other kids finishing the test could hear. Nancy Bobofit smirked at me and made sarcastic little kissing
            motions with her lips.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I mumbled, ‚ÄúOkay, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶‚Äù Mr. Brunner wheeled his chair back and forth, like he wasn‚Äôt sure what to say.
            ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the right place for you. It was only a matter of time.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My eyes stung.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Here was my favorite teacher, in front of the class, telling me I couldn‚Äôt handle it.
            After
            saying he believed in me all year, now he was telling me I was destined to get kicked out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said, trembling.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù Mr. Brunner said. ‚ÄúOh, confound it all. What I‚Äôm trying to say‚Ä¶you‚Äôre not
            normal,
            Percy. That‚Äôs nothing to be&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I blurted. ‚ÄúThanks a lot, sir, for reminding me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But I was already gone.</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
          <p class="calibre1">On the last day of the term, I shoved my clothes into my suitcase.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-52" class="calibre17">The other guys were joking around, talking about their vacation
            plans.
            One of them was going on a hiking trip to Switzerland. Another was cruising the Caribbean for a month. They
            were juvenile delinquents, like me, but they were <i class="calibre7">rich</i> juvenile delinquents. Their
            daddies were executives, or ambassadors, or celebrities. I was a nobody, from a family of nobodies.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They asked me what I‚Äôd be doing this summer and I told them I was going back to the city.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">What I didn‚Äôt tell them was that I‚Äôd have to get a summer job walking dogs or selling
            magazine subscriptions, and spend my free time worrying about where I‚Äôd go to school in the fall.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù one of the guys said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They went back to their conversation as if I‚Äôd never existed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The only person I dreaded saying good-bye to was Grover, but as it turned out, I didn‚Äôt
            have to. He‚Äôd booked a ticket to Manhattan on the same Greyhound as I had, so there we were, together again,
            heading into the city.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">During the whole bus ride, Grover kept glancing nervously down the aisle, watching the
            other passengers. It occurred to me that he‚Äôd always acted nervous and fidgety when we left Yancy, as if he
            expected something bad to happen. Before, I‚Äôd always assumed he was worried about getting teased. But there
            was nobody to tease him on the Greyhound.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúLooking for the Kindly Ones?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover nearly jumped out of his seat. ‚ÄúWha&mdash;what do you mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I confessed about eavesdropping on him and Mr. Brunner the night before the exam.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover‚Äôs eye twitched. ‚ÄúHow much did you hear?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶not much. What‚Äôs the summer solstice deadline?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He winced. ‚ÄúLook, Percy‚Ä¶I was just worried for you, see? I mean, hallucinating about
            demon
            math teachers‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd I was telling Mr. Brunner that maybe you were overstressed or something, because
            there
            was no such person as Mrs. Dodds, and‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover, you‚Äôre a really, really bad liar.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His ears turned pink.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">From his shirt pocket, he fished out a grubby business card. ‚ÄúJust take this, okay? In
            case
            you need me this summer.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-53" class="calibre17">The card was in fancy script, which was murder on my dyslexic eyes,
            but I finally made out something like:</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre26"><b>Grover Underwood</b></span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre26"><b>Keeper</b></span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre26"><b>Half-Blood Hill</b></span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre26"><b>Long Island, New York</b></span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre26"><b>(800) 009-0009</b></span></p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Half&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it aloud!‚Äù he yelped. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my, um‚Ä¶summer address.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My heart sank. Grover had a summer home. I‚Äôd never considered that his family might be as
            rich as the others at Yancy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said glumly. ‚ÄúSo, like, if I want to come visit your mansion.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He nodded. ‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶or if you need me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy would I need you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It came out harsher than I meant it to.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover blushed right down to his Adam‚Äôs apple. ‚ÄúLook, Percy, the truth is, I&mdash;I kind
            of have to protect you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All year long, I‚Äôd gotten in fights, keeping bullies away from him. I‚Äôd lost sleep
            worrying
            that he‚Äôd get beaten up next year without me. And here he was acting like he was the one who defended <i
              class="calibre7">me</i>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhat exactly are you protecting me from?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was a huge grinding noise under our feet. Black smoke poured from the dashboard and
            the whole bus filled with a smell like rotten eggs. The driver cursed and limped the Greyhound over to the
            side of the highway.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre17">After a few minutes clanking around in the engine compartment, the
            driver announced that we‚Äôd all have to get off. Grover and I filed outside with everybody else.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We were on a stretch of country road&mdash;no place you‚Äôd notice if you didn‚Äôt break down
            there. On our side of the highway was nothing but maple trees and litter from passing cars. On the other
            side,
            across four lanes of asphalt shimmering with afternoon heat, was an old-fashioned fruit stand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The stuff on sale looked really good: heaping boxes of bloodred cherries and apples,
            walnuts and apricots, jugs of cider in a claw-foot tub full of ice. There were no customers, just three old
            ladies sitting in rocking chairs in the shade of a maple tree, knitting the biggest pair of socks I‚Äôd ever
            seen.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I mean these socks were the size of sweaters, but they were clearly socks. The lady on
            the
            right knitted one of them. The lady on the left knitted the other. The lady in the middle held an enormous
            basket of electric-blue yarn.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All three women looked ancient, with pale faces wrinkled like fruit leather, silver hair
            tied back in white bandannas, bony arms sticking out of bleached cotton dresses.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The weirdest thing was, they seemed to be looking right at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked over at Grover to say something about this and saw that the blood had drained
            from
            his face. His nose was twitching.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHey, man&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTell me they‚Äôre not looking at you. They are, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah. Weird, huh? You think those socks would fit me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot funny, Percy. Not funny at all.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The old lady in the middle took out a huge pair of scissors&mdash;gold and silver,
            long-bladed, like shears. I heard Grover catch his breath.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting on the bus,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a thousand degrees in there.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù He pried open the door and climbed inside, but I stayed back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Across the road, the old ladies were still watching me. The middle one cut the yarn, and
            I
            swear I could hear that <i class="calibre7">snip</i> across four lanes of traffic. Her two friends balled up
            the electric-blue socks, leaving me wondering who they could possibly be for&mdash;Sasquatch or Godzilla.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">At the rear of the bus, the driver wrenched a big chunk of smoking metal out of the
            engine
            compartment. The bus shuddered, and the engine roared back to life.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre17">The passengers cheered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDarn right!‚Äù yelled the driver. He slapped the bus with his hat. ‚ÄúEverybody back on
            board!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Once we got going, I started feeling feverish, as if I‚Äôd caught the flu.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover didn‚Äôt look much better. He was shivering and his teeth were chattering.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat are you not telling me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He dabbed his forehead with his shirt sleeve. ‚ÄúPercy, what did you see back at the fruit
            stand?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou mean the old ladies? What is it about them, man? They‚Äôre not like‚Ä¶Mrs. Dodds, are
            they?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His expression was hard to read, but I got the feeling that the fruit-stand ladies were
            something much, much worse than Mrs. Dodds. He said, ‚ÄúJust tell me what you saw.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe middle one took out her scissors, and she cut the yarn.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He closed his eyes and made a gesture with his fingers that might‚Äôve been crossing
            himself,
            but it wasn‚Äôt. It was something else, something almost&mdash;older.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He said, ‚ÄúYou saw her snip the cord.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah. So?‚Äù But even as I said it, I knew it was a big deal.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis is not happening,‚Äù Grover mumbled. He started chewing at his thumb. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want
            this to be like the last time.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat last time?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAlways sixth grade. They never get past sixth.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover,‚Äù I said, because he was really starting to scare me. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking
            about?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLet me walk you home from the bus station. Promise me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">This seemed like a strange request to me, but I promised he could.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIs this like a superstition or something?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">No answer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover&mdash;that snipping of the yarn. Does that mean somebody is going to die?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He looked at me mournfully, like he was already picking the kind of flowers I‚Äôd like best
            on my coffin.</p>

          <h2>Chapter 3: GROVER UNEXPECTEDLY LOSES HIS PANTS</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">C</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">ONFESSION
              TIME:</span> I <span class="calibre5">DITCHED</span> G<span class="calibre5">ROVER</span> as
            soon as we got to the bus terminal. I know, I know. It was rude. But Grover was freaking me out,
            looking at me like I was a dead man, muttering ‚ÄúWhy does this always happen?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy does it
            always have to be sixth grade?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Whenever he got upset, Grover‚Äôs bladder acted up, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised when, as we
            got off the bus, he made me promise to wait for him, then made a beeline for the restroom. Instead
            of waiting, I got my suitcase, slipped outside, and caught the first taxi uptown.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúEast One-hundred-and-fourth and First,‚Äù I told the driver.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">A word about my mother, before you meet her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her name is Sally Jackson and she‚Äôs the best person in the world, which just proves
            my theory that the best people have the rottenest luck. Her own parents died in a plane crash when
            she was five, and she was raised by an uncle who didn‚Äôt care much about her. She wanted to be a
            novelist, so she spent high school working to save enough money for a college with a good
            creative-writing program. Then her uncle got cancer, and she quit school her senior year to take
            care of him. After he died, she was left with no money, no family, and no diploma.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-59" class="calibre17">The only good break she ever got was meeting my dad.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I don‚Äôt have any memories of him, just this sort of warm glow, maybe the barest
            trace of his smile. My mom doesn‚Äôt like to talk about him because it makes her sad. She has no
            pictures.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">See, they weren‚Äôt married. She told me he was rich and important, and their
            relationship was a secret. Then one day, he set sail across the Atlantic on some important journey,
            and he never came back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Lost at sea, my mom told me. Not dead. Lost at sea.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She worked odd jobs, took night classes to get her high school diploma, and raised
            me on her own. She never complained or got mad. Not even once. But I knew I wasn‚Äôt an easy kid.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, she married Gabe Ugliano, who was nice the first thirty seconds we knew
            him, then showed his true colors as a world-class jerk. When I was young, I nicknamed him Smelly
            Gabe. I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs the truth. The guy reeked like moldy garlic pizza wrapped in gym shorts.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Between the two of us, we made my mom‚Äôs life pretty hard. The way Smelly Gabe
            treated her, the way he and I got along‚Ä¶well, when I came home is a good example.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">I walked into our little apartment, hoping my mom would be home from work. Instead,
            Smelly Gabe was in the living room, playing poker with his buddies. The television blared ESPN.
            Chips and beer cans were strewn all over the carpet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Hardly looking up, he said around his cigar, ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre home.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my mom?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWorking,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou got any cash?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That was it. No <i class="calibre7">Welcome back. Good to see you. How has your
              life been the last six months?</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe had put on weight. He looked like a tuskless walrus in thrift-store clothes.
            He had about three hairs on his head, all combed over his bald scalp, as if that made him handsome
            or something.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-60" class="calibre17">He managed the Electronics Mega-Mart in Queens, but he stayed
            home most of the time. I don‚Äôt know why he hadn‚Äôt been fired long before. He just kept on collecting
            paychecks, spending the money on cigars that made me nauseous, and on beer, of course. Always beer.
            Whenever I was home, he expected me to provide his gambling funds. He called that our ‚Äúguy secret.‚Äù
            Meaning, if I told my mom, he would punch my lights out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any cash,‚Äù I told him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He raised a greasy eyebrow.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe could sniff out money like a bloodhound, which was surprising, since his own
            smell should‚Äôve covered up everything else.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou took a taxi from the bus station,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúProbably paid with a twenty. Got
            six, seven bucks in change. Somebody expects to live under this roof, he ought to carry his own
            weight. Am I right, Eddie?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Eddie, the super of the apartment building, looked at me with a twinge of sympathy.
            ‚ÄúCome on, Gabe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe kid just got here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAm I <i class="calibre7">right</i>?‚Äù Gabe repeated.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Eddie scowled into his bowl of pretzels. The other two guys passed gas in harmony.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said. I dug a wad of dollars out of my pocket and threw the money on the
            table. ‚ÄúI hope you lose.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour report card came, brain boy!‚Äù he shouted after me. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt act so
            snooty!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I slammed the door to my room, which really wasn‚Äôt my room. During school months,
            it was Gabe‚Äôs ‚Äústudy.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt study anything in there except old car magazines, but he loved
            shoving my stuff in the closet, leaving his muddy boots on my windowsill, and doing his best to make
            the place smell like his nasty cologne and cigars and stale beer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I dropped my suitcase on the bed. Home sweet home.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe‚Äôs smell was almost worse than the nightmares about Mrs. Dodds, or the sound of
            that old fruit lady‚Äôs shears snipping the yarn.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But as soon as I thought that, my legs felt weak. I remembered Grover‚Äôs look of
            panic&mdash;how he‚Äôd made me promise I wouldn‚Äôt go home without him. A sudden chill rolled through
            me. I felt like someone&mdash;something&mdash;was looking for me right now, maybe pounding its way
            up the stairs, growing long, horrible talons.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I heard my mom‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúPercy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She opened the bedroom door, and my fears melted.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre17">My mother can make me feel good just by walking into the room.
            Her eyes sparkle and change color in the light. Her smile is warm as a quilt. She‚Äôs got a few gray
            streaks mixed in with her long brown hair, but I never think of her as old. When she looks at me,
            it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs seeing all the good things about me, none of the bad. I‚Äôve never heard her raise her
            voice or say an unkind word to anyone, not even me or Gabe.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-63" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, Percy.‚Äù She hugged me tight. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it. You‚Äôve
            grown since Christmas!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her red-white-and-blue Sweet on America uniform smelled like the best things in the
            world: chocolate, licorice, and all the other stuff she sold at the candy shop in Grand Central.
            She‚Äôd brought me a huge bag of ‚Äúfree samples,‚Äù the way she always did when I came home.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We sat together on the edge of the bed. While I attacked the blueberry sour
            strings, she ran her hand through my hair and demanded to know everything I hadn‚Äôt put in my
            letters. She didn‚Äôt mention anything about my getting expelled. She didn‚Äôt seem to care about that.
            But was I okay? Was her little boy doing all right?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I told her she was smothering me, and to lay off and all that, but secretly, I was
            really, really glad to see her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">From the other room, Gabe yelled, ‚ÄúHey, Sally&mdash;how about some bean dip, huh?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre17">I gritted my teeth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mom is the nicest lady in the world. She should‚Äôve been married to a
            millionaire, not to some jerk like Gabe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For her sake, I tried to sound upbeat about my last days at Yancy Academy. I told
            her I wasn‚Äôt too down about the expulsion. I‚Äôd lasted almost the whole year this time. I‚Äôd made some
            new friends. I‚Äôd done pretty well in Latin. And honestly, the fights hadn‚Äôt been as bad as the
            headmaster said. I liked Yancy Academy. I really did. I put such a good spin on the year, I almost
            convinced myself. I started choking up, thinking about Grover and Mr. Brunner. Even Nancy Bobofit
            suddenly didn‚Äôt seem so bad.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Until that trip to the museum‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù my mom asked. Her eyes tugged at my conscience, trying to pull out the
            secrets. ‚ÄúDid something scare you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo, Mom.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I felt bad lying. I wanted to tell her about Mrs. Dodds and the three old ladies
            with the yarn, but I thought it would sound stupid.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She pursed her lips. She knew I was holding back, but she didn‚Äôt push me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI have a surprise for you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to the beach.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My eyes widened. ‚ÄúMontauk?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThree nights&mdash;same cabin.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She smiled. ‚ÄúAs soon as I get changed.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt believe it. My mom and I hadn‚Äôt been to Montauk the last two summers,
            because Gabe said there wasn‚Äôt enough money.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe appeared in the doorway and growled, ‚ÄúBean dip, Sally? Didn‚Äôt you hear me?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to punch him, but I met my mom‚Äôs eyes and I understood she was offering me
            a deal: be nice to Gabe for a little while. Just until she was ready to leave for Montauk. Then we
            would get out of here.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI was on my way, honey,‚Äù she told Gabe. ‚ÄúWe were just talking about the trip.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe‚Äôs eyes got small. ‚ÄúThe trip? You mean you were serious about that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt let us go.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOf course he will,‚Äù my mom said evenly. ‚ÄúYour stepfather is just worried about
            money. That‚Äôs all. Besides,‚Äù she added, ‚ÄúGabriel won‚Äôt have to settle for bean dip. I‚Äôll make him
            enough seven-layer dip for the whole weekend. Guacamole. Sour cream. The works.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre17">Gabe softened a bit. ‚ÄúSo this money for your trip‚Ä¶it comes out
            of your clothes budget, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, honey,‚Äù my mother said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd you won‚Äôt take my car anywhere but there and back.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be very careful.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe scratched his double chin. ‚ÄúMaybe if you hurry with that seven-layer dip‚Ä¶And
            maybe if the kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Maybe if I kick you in your soft spot, I thought. And make you sing soprano for a
            week.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But my mom‚Äôs eyes warned me not to make him mad.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Why did she put up with this guy? I wanted to scream. Why did she care what he
            thought?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry I interrupted your incredibly important
            poker game. Please go back to it right now.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe‚Äôs eyes narrowed. His tiny brain was probably trying to detect sarcasm in my
            statement.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah, whatever,‚Äù he decided.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He went back to his game.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThank you, Percy,‚Äù my mom said. ‚ÄúOnce we get to Montauk, we‚Äôll talk more
            about‚Ä¶whatever you‚Äôve forgotten to tell me, okay?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For a moment, I thought I saw anxiety in her eyes&mdash;the same fear I‚Äôd seen in
            Grover during the bus ride&mdash;as if my mom too felt an odd chill in the air.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But then her smile returned, and I figured I must have been mistaken. She ruffled
            my hair and went to make Gabe his seven-layer dip.</p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1">An hour later we were ready to leave.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe took a break from his poker game long enough to watch me lug my mom‚Äôs bags to
            the car. He kept griping and groaning about losing her cooking&mdash;and more important, his ‚Äô78
            Camaro&mdash;for the whole weekend.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot a scratch on this car, brain boy,‚Äù he warned me as I loaded the last bag. ‚ÄúNot
            one little scratch.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Like I‚Äôd be the one driving. I was twelve. But that didn‚Äôt matter to Gabe. If a
            seagull so much as pooped on his paint job, he‚Äôd find a way to blame me.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre17">Watching him lumber back toward the apartment building, I got
            so mad I did something I can‚Äôt explain. As Gabe reached the doorway, I made the hand gesture I‚Äôd
            seen Grover make on the bus, a sort of warding-off-evil gesture, a clawed hand over my heart, then a
            shoving movement toward Gabe. The screen door slammed shut so hard it whacked him in the butt and
            sent him flying up the staircase as if he‚Äôd been shot from a cannon. Maybe it was just the wind, or
            some freak accident with the hinges, but I didn‚Äôt stay long enough to find out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got in the Camaro and told my mom to step on it.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Our rental cabin was on the south shore, way out at the tip of Long Island. It was a
            little pastel box with faded curtains, half sunken into the dunes. There was always sand in the
            sheets and spiders in the cabinets, and most of the time the sea was too cold to swim in.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I loved the place.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We‚Äôd been going there since I was a baby. My mom had been going even longer. She
            never exactly said, but I knew why the beach was special to her. It was the place where she‚Äôd met my
            dad.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As we got closer to Montauk, she seemed to grow younger, years of worry and work
            disappearing from her face. Her eyes turned the color of the sea.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We got there at sunset, opened all the cabin‚Äôs windows, and went through our usual
            cleaning routine. We walked on the beach, fed blue corn chips to the seagulls, and munched on blue
            jelly beans, blue saltwater taffy, and all the other free samples my mom had brought from work.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I guess I should explain the blue food.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">See, Gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing. They had this fight, which
            seemed like a really small thing at the time. But ever since, my mom went out of her way to eat
            blue. She baked blue birthday cakes. She mixed blueberry smoothies. She bought blue-corn tortilla
            chips and brought home blue candy from the shop. This&mdash;along with keeping her maiden name,
            Jackson, rather than calling herself Mrs. Ugliano&mdash;was proof that she wasn‚Äôt totally suckered
            by Gabe. She did have a rebellious streak, like me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When it got dark, we made a fire. We roasted hot dogs and marshmallows. Mom told me
            stories about when she was a kid, back before her parents died in the plane crash. She told me about
            the books she wanted to write someday, when she had enough money to quit the candy shop.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre17">Eventually, I got up the nerve to ask about what was always on
            my mind whenever we came to Montauk&mdash;my father. Mom‚Äôs eyes went all misty. I figured she would
            tell me the same things she always did, but I never got tired of hearing them.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe was kind, Percy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTall, handsome, and powerful. But gentle, too. You
            have his black hair, you know, and his green eyes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mom fished a blue jelly bean out of her candy bag. ‚ÄúI wish he could see you, Percy.
            He would be so proud.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wondered how she could say that. What was so great about me? A dyslexic,
            hyperactive boy with a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the sixth time in six years.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow old was I?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶when he left?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She watched the flames. ‚ÄúHe was only with me for one summer, Percy. Right here at
            this beach. This cabin.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶he knew me as a baby.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo, honey. He knew I was expecting a baby, but he never saw you. He had to leave
            before you were born.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to square that with the fact that I seemed to remember‚Ä¶something about my
            father. A warm glow. A smile.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I had always assumed he knew me as a baby. My mom had never said it outright, but
            still, I‚Äôd felt it must be true. Now, to be told that he‚Äôd never even seen me‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I felt angry at my father. Maybe it was stupid, but I resented him for going on
            that ocean voyage, for not having the guts to marry my mom. He‚Äôd left us, and now we were stuck with
            Smelly Gabe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAre you going to send me away again?‚Äù I asked her. ‚ÄúTo another boarding school?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">She pulled a marshmallow from the fire.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, honey.‚Äù Her voice was heavy. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶I think we‚Äôll have to do
            something.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause you don‚Äôt want me around?‚Äù I regretted the words as soon as they were out.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mom‚Äôs eyes welled with tears. She took my hand, squeezed it tight. ‚ÄúOh, Percy,
            no. I&mdash;I <i class="calibre7">have</i> to, honey. For your own good. I have to send you away.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre17">Her words reminded me of what Mr. Brunner had said&mdash;that
            it was best for me to leave Yancy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not normal,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou say that as if it‚Äôs a bad thing, Percy. But you don‚Äôt realize how important
            you are. I thought Yancy Academy would be far enough away. I thought you‚Äôd finally be safe.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSafe from what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She met my eyes, and a flood of memories came back to me&mdash;all the weird, scary
            things that had ever happened to me, some of which I‚Äôd tried to forget.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">During third grade, a man in a black trench coat had stalked me on the playground.
            When the teachers threatened to call the police, he went away growling, but no one believed me when
            I told them that under his broad-brimmed hat, the man only had one eye, right in the middle of his
            head.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before that&mdash;a really early memory. I was in preschool, and a teacher
            accidentally put me down for a nap in a cot that a snake had slithered into. My mom screamed when
            she came to pick me up and found me playing with a limp, scaly rope I‚Äôd somehow managed to strangle
            to death with my meaty toddler hands.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In every single school, something creepy had happened, something unsafe, and I was
            forced to move.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I knew I should tell my mom about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs. Dodds
            at the art museum, about my weird hallucination that I had sliced my math teacher into dust with a
            sword. But I couldn‚Äôt make myself tell her. I had a strange feeling the news would end our trip to
            Montauk, and I didn‚Äôt want that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried to keep you as close to me as I could,‚Äù my mom said. ‚ÄúThey told me that
            was a mistake. But there‚Äôs only one other option, Percy&mdash;the place your father wanted to send
            you. And I just‚Ä¶I just can‚Äôt stand to do it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy father wanted me to go to a special school?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot a school,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúA summer camp.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My head was spinning. Why would my dad&mdash;who hadn‚Äôt even stayed long enough to
            see me born&mdash;talk to my mom about a summer camp? And if it was so important, why hadn‚Äôt she
            ever mentioned it before?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Percy,‚Äù she said, seeing the look in my eyes. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt talk about
            it. I&mdash;I couldn‚Äôt send you to that place. It might mean saying good-bye to you for good.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-69" class="calibre17">‚ÄúFor good? But if it‚Äôs only a summer camp‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She turned toward the fire, and I knew from her expression that if I asked her any
            more questions she would start to cry.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">That night I had a vivid dream.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was storming on the beach, and two beautiful animals, a white horse and a golden
            eagle, were trying to kill each other at the edge of the surf. The eagle swooped down and slashed
            the horse‚Äôs muzzle with its huge talons. The horse reared up and kicked at the eagle‚Äôs wings. As
            they fought, the ground rumbled, and a monstrous voice chuckled somewhere beneath the earth, goading
            the animals to fight harder.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I ran toward them, knowing I had to stop them from killing each other, but I was
            running in slow motion. I knew I would be too late. I saw the eagle dive down, its beak aimed at the
            horse‚Äôs wide eyes, and I screamed, <i class="calibre7">No</i>!</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I woke with a start.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Outside, it really was storming, the kind of storm that cracks trees and blows down
            houses. There was no horse or eagle on the beach, just lightning making false daylight, and
            twenty-foot waves pounding the dunes like artillery.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre17">With the next thunderclap, my mom woke. She sat up, eyes wide,
            and said, ‚ÄúHurricane.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I knew that was crazy. Long Island never sees hurricanes this early in the summer.
            But the ocean seemed to have forgotten. Over the roar of the wind, I heard a distant bellow, an
            angry, tortured sound that made my hair stand on end.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then a much closer noise, like mallets in the sand. A desperate voice&mdash;
            someone yelling, pounding on our cabin door.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mother sprang out of bed in her nightgown and threw open the lock.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover stood framed in the doorway against a backdrop of pouring rain. But he
            wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶he wasn‚Äôt exactly Grover.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSearching all night,‚Äù he gasped. ‚ÄúWhat were you thinking?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mother looked at me in terror&mdash;not scared of Grover, but of why he‚Äôd come.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù she said, shouting to be heard over the rain. ‚ÄúWhat happened at school?
            What didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was frozen, looking at Grover. I couldn‚Äôt understand what I was seeing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúO Zeu kai alloi theoi!‚Äù</i> he yelled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right behind me!
            Didn‚Äôt you tell her?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was too shocked to register that he‚Äôd just cursed in ancient Greek, and I‚Äôd
            understood him perfectly. I was too shocked to wonder how Grover had gotten here by himself in the
            middle of the night. Because Grover didn‚Äôt have his pants on&mdash;and where his legs should
            be‚Ä¶where his legs should be‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mom looked at me sternly and talked in a tone she‚Äôd never used before: ‚Äú<i
              class="calibre7">Percy</i>. Tell me <i class="calibre7">now</i>!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stammered something about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs. Dodds, and
            my mom stared at me, her face deathly pale in the flashes of lightning.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She grabbed her purse, tossed me my rain jacket, and said, ‚ÄúGet to the car. Both of
            you. <i class="calibre7">Go!</i>‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover ran for the Camaro&mdash;but he wasn‚Äôt running, exactly. He was trotting,
            shaking his shaggy hindquarters, and suddenly his story about a muscular disorder in his legs made
            sense to me. I understood how he could run so fast and still limp when he walked.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-71" class="calibre17">Because where his feet should be, there were no feet. There
            were cloven hooves.</p>

          <h2>Chapter 4: MY MOTHER TEACHES ME BULLFIGHTING</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">W</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">E TORE THROUGH THE NIGHT</span>
            along dark country roads. Wind slammed against the Camaro. Rain lashed the windshield. I didn‚Äôt know how my
            mom could see anything, but she kept her foot on the gas.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Every time there was a flash of lightning, I looked at Grover sitting next to me in the
            backseat and I wondered if I‚Äôd gone insane, or if he was wearing some kind of shag-carpet pants. But, no,
            the
            smell was one I remembered from kindergarten field trips to the petting zoo&mdash;lanolin, like from wool.
            The
            smell of a wet barnyard animal.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All I could think to say was, ‚ÄúSo, you and my mom‚Ä¶know each other?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover‚Äôs eyes flitted to the rearview mirror, though there were no cars behind us. ‚ÄúNot
            exactly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI mean, we‚Äôve never met in person. But she knew I was watching you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWatching me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúKeeping tabs on you. Making sure you were okay. But I wasn‚Äôt faking being your friend,‚Äù
            he
            added hastily. ‚ÄúI <i class="calibre7">am</i> your friend.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶what <i class="calibre7">are</i> you, exactly?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt matter right now.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover let out a sharp, throaty <i class="calibre7">‚ÄúBlaa-ha-ha!‚Äù</i></p>
          <p id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre17">I‚Äôd heard him make that sound before, but I‚Äôd always assumed it was
            a
            nervous laugh. Now I realized it was more of an irritated bleat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGoat!‚Äù he cried.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm a <i class="calibre7">goat</i> from the waist down.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou just said it didn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">Blaa-ha-ha!</i> There are satyrs who would trample you underhoof for
            such an insult!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhoa. Wait. Satyrs. You mean like‚Ä¶Mr. Brunner‚Äôs myths?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWere those old ladies at the fruit stand a <i class="calibre7">myth</i>, Percy? Was Mrs.
            Dodds a myth?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo you <i class="calibre7">admit</i> there was a Mrs. Dodds!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen why&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe less you knew, the fewer monsters you‚Äôd attract,‚Äù Grover said, like that should be
            perfectly obvious. ‚ÄúWe put Mist over the humans‚Äô eyes. We hoped you‚Äôd think the Kindly One was a
            hallucination. But it was no good. You started to realize who you are.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho I&mdash;wait a minute, what do you mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The weird bellowing noise rose up again somewhere behind us, closer than before. Whatever
            was chasing us was still on our trail.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù my mom said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs too much to explain and not enough time. We have to get
            you
            to safety.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSafety from what? Who‚Äôs after me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, nobody much,‚Äù Grover said, obviously still miffed about the donkey comment. ‚ÄúJust
            the
            Lord of the Dead and a few of his blood-thirstiest minions.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSorry, Mrs. Jackson. Could you drive faster, please?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to wrap my mind around what was happening, but I couldn‚Äôt do it. I knew this
            wasn‚Äôt
            a dream. I had no imagination. I could never dream up something this weird.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mom made a hard left. We swerved onto a narrower road, racing past darkened farmhouses
            and wooded hills and <span class="calibre5">PICK YOUR OWN STRAWBERRIES</span> signs on white picket fences.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe summer camp I told you about.‚Äù My mother‚Äôs voice was tight; she
            was trying for my sake not to be scared. ‚ÄúThe place your father wanted to send you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe place you didn‚Äôt want me to go.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPlease, dear,‚Äù my mother begged. ‚ÄúThis is hard enough. Try to understand. You‚Äôre in
            danger.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause some old ladies cut yarn.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThose weren‚Äôt old ladies,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúThose were the Fates. Do you know what it
            means&mdash;the fact they appeared in front of you? They only do that when you‚Äôre about to‚Ä¶when someone‚Äôs
            about to die.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhoa. You said ‚Äòyou.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo I didn‚Äôt. I said ‚Äòsomeone.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou meant ‚Äòyou.‚Äô As in me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI meant <i class="calibre7">you</i>, like ‚Äòsomeone.‚Äô Not you, <i
              class="calibre7">you</i>.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBoys!‚Äù my mom said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She pulled the wheel hard to the right, and I got a glimpse of a figure she‚Äôd swerved to
            avoid&mdash;a dark fluttering shape now lost behind us in the storm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there,‚Äù my mother said, ignoring my question. ‚ÄúAnother mile. Please.
            Please.
            Please.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt know where <i class="calibre7">there</i> was, but I found myself leaning forward
            in the car, anticipating, wanting us to arrive.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Outside, nothing but rain and darkness&mdash;the kind of empty countryside you get way
            out
            on the tip of Long Island. I thought about Mrs. Dodds and the moment when she‚Äôd changed into the thing with
            pointed teeth and leathery wings. My limbs went numb from delayed shock. She really <i
              class="calibre7">hadn‚Äôt</i> been human. She‚Äôd meant to kill me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I thought about Mr. Brunner‚Ä¶and the sword he had thrown me. Before I could ask
            Grover
            about that, the hair rose on the back of my neck. There was a blinding flash, a jaw-rattling <i
              class="calibre7">boom!</i>, and our car exploded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I remember feeling weightless, like I was being crushed, fried, and hosed down all the at
            the same time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I peeled my forehead off the back of the driver‚Äôs seat and said, ‚ÄúOw.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy!‚Äù my mom shouted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-74" class="calibre17">I tried to shake off the daze. I wasn‚Äôt dead. The car hadn‚Äôt really
            exploded. We‚Äôd swerved into a ditch. Our driver‚Äôs-side doors were wedged in the mud. The roof had cracked
            open
            like an eggshell and rain was pouring in.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-75" class="calibre3"><img src="images/000120.jpg" alt="" class="calibre32" /></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Lightning. That was the only explanation. We‚Äôd been blasted right off the road. Next to
            me
            in the backseat was a big motionless lump. ‚ÄúGrover!‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-76" class="calibre17">He was slumped over, blood trickling from the side of his mouth. I
            shook his furry hip, thinking, No! Even if you are half barnyard animal, you‚Äôre my best friend and I don‚Äôt
            want you to die!</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then he groaned ‚ÄúFood,‚Äù and I knew there was hope.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù my mother said, ‚Äúwe have to‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice faltered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked back. In a flash of lightning, through the mud-spattered rear windshield, I saw
            a
            figure lumbering toward us on the shoulder of the road. The sight of it made my skin crawl. It was a dark
            silhouette of a huge guy, like a football player. He seemed to be holding a blanket over his head. His top
            half was bulky and fuzzy. His upraised hands made it look like he had horns.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWho is&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù my mother said, deadly serious. ‚ÄúGet out of the car.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mother threw herself against the driver‚Äôs-side door. It was jammed shut in the mud. I
            tried mine. Stuck too. I looked up desperately at the hole in the roof. It might‚Äôve been an exit, but the
            edges were sizzling and smoking.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúClimb out the passenger‚Äôs side!‚Äù my mother told me. ‚ÄúPercy&mdash;you have to run. Do you
            see that big tree?</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Another flash of lightning, and through the smoking hole in the roof I saw the tree she
            meant: a huge, White House Christmas tree&ndash;sized pine at the crest of the nearest hill.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the property line,‚Äù my mom said. ‚ÄúGet over that hill and you‚Äôll see a big
            farmhouse
            down in the valley. Run and don‚Äôt look back. Yell for help. Don‚Äôt stop until you reach the door.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre coming too.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her face was pale, her eyes as sad as when she looked at the ocean.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúYou <i class="calibre7">are</i> coming with me. Help me carry Grover.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFood!‚Äù Grover moaned, a little louder.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The man with the blanket on his head kept coming toward us, making his grunting, snorting
            noises. As he got closer, I realized he <i class="calibre7">couldn‚Äôt</i> be holding a blanket over his head,
            because his hands&mdash;huge meaty hands&mdash;were swinging at his sides. There was no blanket. Meaning the
            bulky, fuzzy mass that was too big to be his head‚Ä¶was his head. And the points that looked like horns‚Ä¶</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-77" class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt want <i class="calibre7">us</i>,‚Äù my mother told me. ‚ÄúHe
            wants you. Besides, I can‚Äôt cross the property line.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time, Percy. Go. Please.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got mad then&mdash;mad at my mother, at Grover the goat, at the thing with horns that
            was
            lumbering toward us slowly and deliberately like, like a bull.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I climbed across Grover and pushed the door open into the rain. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going together.
            Come
            on, Mom.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI told you&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMom! I am not leaving you. Help me with Grover.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt wait for her answer. I scrambled outside, dragging Grover from the car. He was
            surprisingly light, but I couldn‚Äôt have carried him very far if my mom hadn‚Äôt come to my aid.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Together, we draped Grover‚Äôs arms over our shoulders and started stumbling uphill through
            wet waist-high grass.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Glancing back, I got my first clear look at the monster. He was seven feet tall, easy,
            his
            arms and legs like something from the cover of <i class="calibre7">Muscle Man</i> magazine&mdash;bulging
            biceps and triceps and a bunch of other ‚Äôceps, all stuffed like baseballs under vein-webbed skin. He wore no
            clothes except underwear &mdash;I mean, bright white Fruit of the Looms&mdash;which would‚Äôve looked funny,
            except that the top half of his body was so scary. Coarse brown hair started at about his belly button and
            got
            thicker as it reached his shoulders.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His neck was a mass of muscle and fur leading up to his enormous head, which had a snout
            as
            long as my arm, snotty nostrils with a gleaming brass ring, cruel black eyes, and horns&mdash;enormous
            black-and-white horns with points you just couldn‚Äôt get from an electric sharpener.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I recognized the monster, all right. He had been in one of the first stories Mr. Brunner
            told us. But he couldn‚Äôt be real.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I blinked the rain out of my eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPasiphae‚Äôs son,‚Äù my mother said. ‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd known how badly they want to kill you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs the Min&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say his name,‚Äù she warned. ‚ÄúNames have power.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The pine tree was still way too far&mdash;a hundred yards uphill at least.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I glanced behind me again.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man hunched over our car, looking in the windows&mdash;or not looking, exactly.
            More like snuffling, nuzzling. I wasn‚Äôt sure why he bothered, since we were only about fifty feet away.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-78" class="calibre17">‚ÄúFood?‚Äù Grover moaned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúMom, what‚Äôs he doing? Doesn‚Äôt he see us?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHis sight and hearing are terrible,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe goes by smell. But he‚Äôll figure out
            where we are soon enough.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As if on cue, the bull-man bellowed in rage. He picked up Gabe‚Äôs Camaro by the torn roof,
            the chassis creaking and groaning. He raised the car over his head and threw it down the road. It slammed
            into
            the wet asphalt and skidded in a shower of sparks for about half a mile before coming to a stop. The gas
            tank
            exploded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Not a scratch,</i> I remembered Gabe saying.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Oops.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù my mom said. ‚ÄúWhen he sees us, he‚Äôll charge. Wait until the last second, then
            jump
            out of the way&mdash;directly sideways. He can‚Äôt change directions very well once he‚Äôs charging. Do you
            understand?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow do you know all this?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve been worried about an attack for a long time. I should have expected this. I was
            selfish, keeping you near me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúKeeping me near you? But&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Another bellow of rage, and the bull-man started tromping uphill.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He‚Äôd smelled us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The pine tree was only a few more yards, but the hill was getting steeper and slicker,
            and
            Grover wasn‚Äôt getting any lighter.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man closed in. Another few seconds and he‚Äôd be on top of us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mother must‚Äôve been exhausted, but she shouldered Grover. ‚ÄúGo, Percy! Separate!
            Remember
            what I said.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre3"><img src="images/000121.jpg" alt="" class="calibre4" /></p>
          <p id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt want to split up, but I had the feeling she was
            right&mdash;it was our only chance. I sprinted to the left, turned, and saw the creature bearing down on me.
            His black eyes glowed with hate. He reeked like rotten meat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He lowered his head and charged, those razor-sharp horns aimed straight at my chest.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The fear in my stomach made me want to bolt, but that wouldn‚Äôt work. I could never outrun
            this thing. So I held my ground, and at the last moment, I jumped to the side.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man stormed past like a freight train, then bellowed with frustration and
            turned,
            but not toward me this time, toward my mother, who was setting Grover down in the grass.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We‚Äôd reached the crest of the hill. Down the other side I could see a valley, just as my
            mother had said, and the lights of a farmhouse glowing yellow through the rain. But that was half a mile
            away.
            We‚Äôd never make it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man grunted, pawing the ground. He kept eyeing my mother, who was now retreating
            slowly downhill, back toward the road, trying to lead the monster away from Grover.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRun, Percy!‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go any farther. Run!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But I just stood there, frozen in fear, as the monster charged her. She tried to
            sidestep,
            as she‚Äôd told me to do, but the monster had learned his lesson. His hand shot out and grabbed her by the
            neck
            as she tried to get away. He lifted her as she struggled, kicking and pummeling the air.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMom!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She caught my eyes, managed to choke out one last word: ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then, with an angry roar, the monster closed his fists around my mother‚Äôs neck, and she
            dissolved before my eyes, melting into light, a shimmering golden form, as if she were a holographic
            projection. A blinding flash, and she was simply‚Ä¶gone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Anger replaced my fear. Newfound strength burned in my limbs&mdash;the same rush of
            energy
            I‚Äôd gotten when Mrs. Dodds grew talons.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man bore down on Grover, who lay helpless in the grass. The monster hunched
            over,
            snuffling my best friend as if he were about to lift Grover up and make him dissolve too.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt allow that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stripped off my red rain jacket.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I screamed, waving the jacket, running to one side of the
            monster. ‚ÄúHey, stupid! Ground beef!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRaaaarrrrr!‚Äù The monster turned toward me, shaking his meaty fists.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I had an idea&mdash;a stupid idea, but better than no idea at all. I put my back to the
            big
            pine tree and waved my red jacket in front of the bull-man, thinking I‚Äôd jump out of the way at the last
            moment.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But it didn‚Äôt happen like that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man charged too fast, his arms out to grab me whichever way I tried to dodge.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Time slowed down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My legs tensed. I couldn‚Äôt jump sideways, so I leaped straight up, kicking off from the
            creature‚Äôs head, using it as a springboard, turning in midair, and landing on his neck.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">How did I do that? I didn‚Äôt have time to figure it out. A millisecond later, the
            monster‚Äôs
            head slammed into the tree and the impact nearly knocked my teeth out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man staggered around, trying to shake me. I locked my arms around his horns to
            keep from being thrown. Thunder and lightning were still going strong. The rain was in my eyes. The smell of
            rotten meat burned my nostrils.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The monster shook himself around and bucked like a rodeo bull. He should have just backed
            up into the tree and smashed me flat, but I was starting to realize that this thing had only one gear:
            forward.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Meanwhile, Grover started groaning in the grass. I wanted to yell at him to shut up, but
            the way I was getting tossed around, if I opened my mouth I‚Äôd bite my own tongue off.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFood!‚Äù Grover moaned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man wheeled toward him, pawed the ground again, and got ready to charge. I
            thought
            about how he had squeezed the life out of my mother, made her disappear in a flash of light, and rage filled
            me like high-octane fuel. I got both hands around one horn and I pulled backward with all my might. The
            monster tensed, gave a surprised grunt, then&mdash;<i class="calibre7">snap</i>!</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man screamed and flung me through the air. I landed flat on my back in the
            grass.
            My head smacked against a rock. When I sat up, my vision was blurry, but I had a horn in my hands, a ragged
            bone weapon the size of a knife.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The monster charged.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Without thinking, I rolled to one side and came up kneeling. As the monster barreled
            past,
            I drove the broken horn straight into his side, right up under his furry rib cage.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bull-man roared in agony. He flailed, clawing at his chest, then began to
            disintegrate&mdash;not like my mother, in a flash of golden light, but like crumbling sand, blown away in
            chunks by the wind, the same way Mrs. Dodds had burst apart.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The monster was gone.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre17">The rain had stopped. The storm still rumbled, but only in the
            distance. I smelled like livestock and my knees were shaking. My head felt like it was splitting open. I was
            weak and scared and trembling with grief. I‚Äôd just seen my mother vanish. I wanted to lie down and cry, but
            there was Grover, needing my help, so I managed to haul him up and stagger down into the valley, toward the
            lights of the farmhouse. I was crying, calling for my mother, but I held on to Grover&mdash;I wasn‚Äôt going
            to
            let him go.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The last thing I remember is collapsing on a wooden porch, looking up at a ceiling fan
            circling above me, moths flying around a yellow light, and the stern faces of a familiar-looking bearded man
            and a pretty girl, her blond hair curled like a princess‚Äôs. They both looked down at me, and the girl said,
            ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the one. He must be.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSilence, Annabeth,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still conscious. Bring him inside.‚Äù</p>

          <h2>Chapter 5: I PLAY PINOCHLE WITH A HORSE</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">I</b></span></span></span> <span class="calibre5">HAD WEIRD DREAMS
              FULL OF BARNYARD</span> animals. Most of them wanted to kill me. The rest wanted food.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I must‚Äôve woken up several times, but what I heard and saw made no sense, so I just
            passed out again. I remember lying in a soft bed, being spoon-fed something that tasted like
            buttered popcorn, only it was pudding. The girl with curly blond hair hovered over me, smirking as
            she scraped drips off my chin with the spoon.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When she saw my eyes open, she asked, ‚ÄúWhat will happen at the summer solstice?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I managed to croak, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She looked around, as if afraid someone would overhear. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? What was
            stolen? We‚Äôve only got a few weeks!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I mumbled, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Somebody knocked on the door, and the girl quickly filled my mouth with pudding.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">The next time I woke up, the girl was gone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A husky blond dude, like a surfer, stood in the corner of the bedroom keeping watch
            over me. He had blue eyes&mdash;at least a dozen of them&mdash;on his cheeks, his forehead, the
            backs of his hands.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre17">When I finally came around for good, there was nothing weird
            about my surroundings, except that they were nicer than I was used to. I was sitting in a deck chair
            on a huge porch, gazing across a meadow at green hills in the distance. The breeze smelled like
            strawberries. There was a blanket over my legs, a pillow behind my neck. All that was great, but my
            mouth felt like a scorpion had been using it for a nest. My tongue was dry and nasty and every one
            of my teeth hurt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">On the table next to me was a tall drink. It looked like iced apple juice, with a
            green straw and a paper parasol stuck through a maraschino cherry.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My hand was so weak I almost dropped the glass once I got my fingers around it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù a familiar voice said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was leaning against the porch railing, looking like he hadn‚Äôt slept in a
            week. Under one arm, he cradled a shoe box. He was wearing blue jeans, Converse hi-tops, and a
            bright orange T-shirt that said <span class="calibre5">CAMP HALF-</span><span class="calibre5">BLOOD</span>
            . Just plain old Grover. Not the goat boy.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre17">So maybe I‚Äôd had a nightmare. Maybe my mom was okay. We were
            still on vacation, and we‚Äôd stopped here at this big house for some reason. And‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou saved my life,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶well, the least I could do‚Ä¶I went back to the
            hill. I thought you might want this.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Reverently, he placed the shoe box in my lap.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Inside was a black-and-white bull‚Äôs horn, the base jagged from being broken off,
            the tip splattered with dried blood. It hadn‚Äôt been a nightmare.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Minotaur,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm, Percy, it isn‚Äôt a good idea&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they call him in the Greek myths, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I demanded. ‚ÄúThe
            Minotaur. Half man, half bull.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shifted uncomfortably. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been out for two days. How much do you
            remember?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy mom. Is she really‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He looked down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared across the meadow. There were groves of trees, a winding stream, acres of
            strawberries spread out under the blue sky. The valley was surrounded by rolling hills, and the
            tallest one, directly in front of us, was the one with the huge pine tree on top. Even that looked
            beautiful in the sunlight.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mother was gone. The whole world should be black and cold. Nothing should look
            beautiful.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Grover sniffled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a failure. I‚Äôm&mdash;I‚Äôm the worst satyr in the
            world.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He moaned, stomping on his foot so hard it came off. I mean, the Converse hi-top
            came off. The inside was filled with Styrofoam, except for a hoof-shaped hole.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, Styx!‚Äù he mumbled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Thunder rolled across the clear sky.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As he struggled to get his hoof back in the fake foot, I thought, Well, that
            settles it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was a satyr. I was ready to bet that if I shaved his curly brown hair, I‚Äôd
            find tiny horns on his head. But I was too miserable to care that satyrs existed, or even minotaurs.
            All that meant was my mom really had been squeezed into nothingness, dissolved into yellow light.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was alone. An orphan. I would have to live with‚Ä¶Smelly Gabe? No. That would never
            happen. I would live on the streets first. I would pretend I was seventeen and join the army. I‚Äôd do
            something.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre17">Grover was still sniffling. The poor kid&mdash;poor goat,
            satyr, whatever&mdash; looked as if he expected to be hit.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt your fault.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, it was. I was supposed to <i class="calibre7">protect</i> you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDid my mother ask you to protect me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo. But that‚Äôs my job. I‚Äôm a keeper. At least‚Ä¶I was.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut why‚Ä¶‚Äù I suddenly felt dizzy, my vision swimming.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt strain yourself,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He helped me hold my glass and put the straw to my lips.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I recoiled at the taste, because I was expecting apple juice. It wasn‚Äôt that at
            all. It was chocolate-chip cookies. Liquid cookies. And not just any cookies&mdash;my mom‚Äôs homemade
            blue chocolate-chip cookies, buttery and hot, with the chips still melting. Drinking it, my whole
            body felt warm and good, full of energy. My grief didn‚Äôt go away, but I felt as if my mom had just
            brushed her hand against my cheek, given me a cookie the way she used to when I was small, and told
            me everything was going to be okay.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before I knew it, I‚Äôd drained the glass. I stared into it, sure I‚Äôd just had a warm
            drink, but the ice cubes hadn‚Äôt even melted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWas it good?‚Äù Grover asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I nodded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat did it taste like?‚Äù He sounded so wistful, I felt guilty.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve let you taste.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His eyes got wide. ‚ÄúNo! That‚Äôs not what I meant. I just‚Ä¶wondered.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúChocolate-chip cookies,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMy mom‚Äôs. Homemade.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He sighed. ‚ÄúAnd how do you feel?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLike I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good. I don‚Äôt think you could risk drinking any
            more of that stuff.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He took the empty glass from me gingerly, as if it were dynamite, and set it back
            on the table. ‚ÄúCome on. Chiron and Mr. D are waiting.‚Äù</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The porch wrapped all the way around the farmhouse.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My legs felt wobbly, trying to walk that far. Grover offered to carry the Minotaur
            horn, but I held on to it. I‚Äôd paid for that souvenir the hard way. I wasn‚Äôt going to let it go.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre17">As we came around the opposite end of the house, I caught my
            breath.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We must‚Äôve been on the north shore of Long Island, because on this side of the
            house, the valley marched all the way up to the water, which glittered about a mile in the distance.
            Between here and there, I simply couldn‚Äôt process everything I was seeing. The landscape was dotted
            with buildings that looked like ancient Greek architecture&mdash;an open-air pavilion, an
            amphitheater, a circular arena&mdash;except that they all looked brand new, their white marble
            columns sparkling in the sun. In a nearby sandpit, a dozen high school&ndash;age kids and satyrs
            played volleyball. Canoes glided across a small lake. Kids in bright orange T-shirts like Grover‚Äôs
            were chasing each other around a cluster of cabins nestled in the woods. Some shot targets at an
            archery range. Others rode horses down a wooded trail, and, unless I was hallucinating, some of
            their horses had wings.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Down at the end of the porch, two men sat across from each other at a card table.
            The blond-haired girl who‚Äôd spoon-fed me popcorn-flavored pudding was leaning on the porch rail next
            to them.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The man facing me was small, but porky. He had a red nose, big watery eyes, and
            curly hair so black it was almost purple. He looked like those paintings of baby angels&mdash;what
            do you call them, hubbubs? No, cherubs. That‚Äôs it. He looked like a cherub who‚Äôd turned middle-aged
            in a trailer park. He wore a tiger-pattern Hawaiian shirt, and he would‚Äôve fit right in at one of
            Gabe‚Äôs power parties, except I got the feeling this guy could‚Äôve out-gambled even my stepfather.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Mr. D,‚Äù Grover murmured to me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the camp
            director. Be polite. The girl, that‚Äôs Annabeth Chase. She‚Äôs just a camper, but she‚Äôs been here
            longer than just about anybody. And you already know Chiron‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre17">He pointed at the guy whose back was to me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">First, I realized he was sitting in the wheelchair. Then I recognized the tweed
            jacket, the thinning brown hair, the scraggly beard.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMr. Brunner!‚Äù I cried.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Latin teacher turned and smiled at me. His eyes had that mischievous glint they
            sometimes got in class when he pulled a pop quiz and made all the multiple choice answers <i
              class="calibre7">B</i>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh, good, Percy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow we have four for pinochle.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He offered me a chair to the right of Mr. D, who looked at me with bloodshot eyes
            and heaved a great sigh. ‚ÄúOh, I suppose I must say it. Welcome to Camp Half-Blood. There. Now, don‚Äôt
            expect me to be glad to see you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUh, thanks.‚Äù I scooted a little farther away from him because, if there was one
            thing I had learned from living with Gabe, it was how to tell when an adult has been hitting the
            happy juice. If Mr. D was a stranger to alcohol, I was a satyr.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnnabeth?‚Äù Mr. Brunner called to the blond girl.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She came forward and Mr. Brunner introduced us. ‚ÄúThis young lady nursed you back to
            health, Percy. Annabeth, my dear, why don‚Äôt you go check on Percy‚Äôs bunk? We‚Äôll be putting him in
            cabin eleven for now.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúSure, Chiron.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She was probably my age, maybe a couple inches taller, and a whole lot more
            athletic looking. With her deep tan and her curly blond hair, she was almost exactly what I thought
            a stereotypical California girl would look like, except her eyes ruined the image. They were
            startling gray, like storm clouds: pretty, but intimidating, too, as if she were analyzing the best
            way to take me down in a fight.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me. I imagined she was
            going to say, <i class="calibre7">You killed a minotaur!</i> or <i class="calibre7">Wow, you‚Äôre so
              awesome!</i> or something like that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Instead she said, ‚ÄúYou drool when you sleep.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then she sprinted off down the lawn, her blond hair flying behind her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I said, anxious to change the subject. ‚ÄúYou, uh, work here, Mr. Brunner?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot Mr. Brunner,‚Äù the ex&ndash;Mr. Brunner said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that was a pseudonym.
            You may call me Chiron.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Totally confused, I looked at the director. ‚ÄúAnd Mr.
            D‚Ä¶does that stand for something?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. D stopped shuffling the cards. He looked at me like I‚Äôd just belched loudly.
            ‚ÄúYoung man, names are powerful things. You don‚Äôt just go around using them for no reason.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh. Right. Sorry.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI must say, Percy,‚Äù Chiron-Brunner broke in, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to see you alive. It‚Äôs been
            a long time since I‚Äôve made a house call to a potential camper. I‚Äôd hate to think I‚Äôve wasted my
            time.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHouse call?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy year at Yancy Academy, to instruct you. We have satyrs at most schools, of
            course, keeping a lookout. But Grover alerted me as soon as he met you. He sensed you were something
            special, so I decided to come upstate. I convinced the other Latin teacher to‚Ä¶ah, take a leave of
            absence.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to remember the beginning of the school year. It seemed like so long ago,
            but I did have a fuzzy memory of there being another Latin teacher my first week at Yancy. Then,
            without explanation, he had disappeared and Mr. Brunner had taken the class.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou came to Yancy just to teach me?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron nodded. ‚ÄúHonestly, I wasn‚Äôt sure about you at first. We contacted your
            mother, let her know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for Camp Half-Blood. But
            you still had so much to learn. Nevertheless, you made it here alive, and that‚Äôs always the first
            test.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover,‚Äù Mr. D said impatiently, ‚Äúare you playing or not?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù Grover trembled as he took the fourth chair, though I didn‚Äôt know why
            he should be so afraid of a pudgy little man in a tiger-print Hawaiian shirt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou <i class="calibre7">do</i> know how to play pinochle?‚Äù Mr. D eyed me
            suspiciously.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid not,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid not, <i class="calibre7">sir</i>,‚Äù he said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I repeated. I was liking the camp director less and less.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he told me, ‚Äúit is, along with gladiator fighting and Pac-Man, one of the
            greatest games ever invented by humans. I would expect all <i class="calibre7">civilized</i> young
            men to know the rules.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the boy can learn,‚Äù Chiron said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhat is this place? What am I doing here? Mr. Brun&mdash;
            Chiron&mdash;why would you go to Yancy Academy just to teach me?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre17">Mr. D snorted. ‚ÄúI asked the same question.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The camp director dealt the cards. Grover flinched every time one landed in his
            pile.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron smiled at me sympathetically, the way he used to in Latin class, as if to
            let me know that no matter what my average was, <i class="calibre7">I</i> was his star student. He
            expected <i class="calibre7">me</i> to have the right answer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDid your mother tell you nothing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShe said‚Ä¶‚Äù I remembered her sad eyes, looking out over the sea. ‚ÄúShe told me she
            was afraid to send me here, even though my father had wanted her to. She said that once I was here,
            I probably couldn‚Äôt leave. She wanted to keep me close to her.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTypical,‚Äù Mr. D said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how they usually get killed. Young man, are you
            bidding or not?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He explained, impatiently, how you bid in pinochle, and so I did.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid there‚Äôs too much to tell,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid our usual
            orientation film won‚Äôt be sufficient.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOrientation film?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Chiron decided. ‚ÄúWell, Percy. You know your friend Grover is a satyr. You
            know‚Äù&mdash;he pointed to the horn in the shoe box&mdash;‚Äúthat you have killed the Minotaur. No
            small feat, either, lad. What you may not know is that great powers are at work in your life.
            Gods&mdash;the forces you call the Greek gods&mdash;are very much alive.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at the others around the table.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I waited for somebody to yell, <i class="calibre7">Not!</i> But all I got was Mr. D
            yelling, ‚ÄúOh, a royal marriage. Trick! Trick!‚Äù He cackled as he tallied up his points.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMr. D,‚Äù Grover asked timidly, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not going to eat it, could I have your
            Diet Coke can?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúEh? Oh, all right.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover bit a huge shard out of the empty aluminum can and chewed it mournfully.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I told Chiron. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs such a thing as God.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, now,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúGod&mdash;capital <i class="calibre7">G</i>, God. That‚Äôs
            a different matter altogether. We shan‚Äôt deal with the metaphysical.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMetaphysical? But you were just talking about&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh, gods, plural, as in, great beings that control the forces of nature and human
            endeavors: the immortal gods of Olympus. That‚Äôs a smaller matter.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre17">‚ÄúSmaller?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, quite. The gods we discussed in Latin class.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúZeus,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHera. Apollo. You mean them.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">And there it was again&mdash;distant thunder on a cloudless day.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYoung man,‚Äù said Mr. D, ‚ÄúI would really be less casual about throwing those names
            around, if I were you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre stories,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre&mdash;myths, to explain lightning and the
            seasons and stuff. They‚Äôre what people believed before there was science.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúScience!‚Äù Mr. D scoffed. ‚ÄúAnd tell me, Perseus Jackson‚Äù&mdash;I flinched when he
            said my real name, which I never told anybody&mdash;‚Äúwhat will people think of your ‚Äòscience‚Äô two
            thousand years from now?‚Äù Mr. D continued. ‚ÄúHmm? They will call it primitive mumbo jumbo. That‚Äôs
            what. Oh, I love mortals&mdash;they have absolutely no sense of perspective. They think they‚Äôve come
            <i class="calibre7">so-o-o</i> far. And have they, Chiron? Look at this boy and tell me.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt liking Mr. D much, but there was something about the way he called me
            mortal, as if‚Ä¶he wasn‚Äôt. It was enough to put a lump in my throat, to suggest why Grover was
            dutifully minding his cards, chewing his soda can, and keeping his mouth shut.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Chiron said, ‚Äúyou may choose to believe or not, but the fact is that <i
              class="calibre7">immortal</i> means immortal. Can you imagine that for a moment, never dying?
            Never fading? Existing, just as you are, for all time?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was about to answer, off the top of my head, that it sounded like a pretty good
            deal, but the tone of Chiron‚Äôs voice made me hesitate.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou mean, whether people believed in you or not,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Chiron agreed. ‚ÄúIf you were a god, how would you like being called a
            myth, an old story to explain lightning? What if I told you, Perseus Jackson, that someday people
            would call <i class="calibre7">you</i> a myth, just created to explain how little boys can get over
            losing their mothers?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My heart pounded. He was trying to make me angry for some reason, but I wasn‚Äôt
            going to let him. I said, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt like it. But I don‚Äôt believe in gods.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôd better,‚Äù Mr. D murmured. ‚ÄúBefore one of them incinerates you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover said, ‚ÄúP-please, sir. He‚Äôs just lost his mother. He‚Äôs in shock.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA lucky thing, too,‚Äù Mr. D grumbled, playing a card. ‚ÄúBad enough I‚Äôm confined to
            this miserable job, working with boys who don‚Äôt even believe!‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre17">He waved his hand and a goblet appeared on the table, as if
            the sunlight had bent, momentarily, and woven the air into glass. The goblet filled itself with red
            wine.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My jaw dropped, but Chiron hardly looked up.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMr. D,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúyour restrictions.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. D looked at the wine and feigned surprise.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDear me.‚Äù He looked at the sky and yelled, ‚ÄúOld habits! Sorry!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">More thunder.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. D waved his hand again, and the wineglass changed into a fresh can of Diet
            Coke. He sighed unhappily, popped the top of the soda, and went back to his card game.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron winked at me. ‚ÄúMr. D offended his father a while back, took a fancy to a
            wood nymph who had been declared off-limits.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA wood nymph,‚Äù I repeated, still staring at the Diet Coke can like it was from
            outer space.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Mr. D confessed. ‚ÄúFather loves to punish me. The first time, Prohibition.
            Ghastly! Absolutely horrid ten years! The second time&mdash;well, she really was pretty, and I
            couldn‚Äôt stay away&mdash;the second time, he sent me here. Half-Blood Hill. Summer camp for brats
            like you. ‚ÄòBe a better influence,‚Äô he told me. ‚ÄòWork with youths rather than tearing them down.‚Äô Ha!
            Absolutely unfair.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. D sounded about six years old, like a pouting little kid.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶‚Äù I stammered, ‚Äúyour father is‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">Di immortales,</i> Chiron,‚Äù Mr. D said. ‚ÄúI thought you taught
            this boy the basics. My father is Zeus, of course.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I ran through D names from Greek mythology. Wine. The skin of a tiger. The satyrs
            that all seemed to work here. The way Grover cringed, as if Mr. D were his master.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Dionysus,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe god of wine.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. D rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúWhat do they say, these days, Grover? Do the children say,
            ‚ÄòWell, duh!‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúY-yes, Mr. D.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen, well, duh! Percy Jackson. Did you think I was Aphrodite, perhaps?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a god.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, child.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA god. You.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre17">He turned to look at me straight on, and I saw a kind of
            purplish fire in his eyes, a hint that this whiny, plump little man was only showing me the tiniest
            bit of his true nature. I saw visions of grape vines choking unbelievers to death, drunken warriors
            insane with battle lust, sailors screaming as their hands turned to flippers, their faces elongating
            into dolphin snouts. I knew that if I pushed him, Mr. D would show me worse things. He would plant a
            disease in my brain that would leave me wearing a straitjacket in a rubber room for the rest of my
            life.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWould you like to test me, child?‚Äù he said quietly.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo. No, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The fire died a little. He turned back to his card game. ‚ÄúI believe I win.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot quite, Mr. D,‚Äù Chiron said. He set down a straight, tallied the points, and
            said, ‚ÄúThe game goes to me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought Mr. D was going to vaporize Chiron right out of his wheelchair, but he
            just sighed through his nose, as if he were used to being beaten by the Latin teacher. He got up,
            and Grover rose, too.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù Mr. D said. ‚ÄúI believe I‚Äôll take a nap before the sing-along tonight.
            But first, Grover, we need to talk, <i class="calibre7">again</i>, about your less-than-perfect
            performance on this assignment.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover‚Äôs face beaded with sweat. ‚ÄúY-yes, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. D turned to me. ‚ÄúCabin eleven, Percy Jackson. And mind your manners.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He swept into the farmhouse, Grover following miserably.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWill Grover be okay?‚Äù I asked Chiron.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron nodded, though he looked a bit troubled. ‚ÄúOld Dionysus isn‚Äôt really mad. He
            just hates his job. He‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ah, grounded, I guess you would say, and he can‚Äôt stand waiting
            another century before he‚Äôs allowed to go back to Olympus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMount Olympus,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me there really is a palace there?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell now, there‚Äôs Mount Olympus in Greece. And then there‚Äôs the home of the gods,
            the convergence point of their powers, which did indeed use to be on Mount Olympus. It‚Äôs still
            called Mount Olympus, out of respect to the old ways, but the palace moves, Percy, just as the gods
            do.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou mean the Greek gods are here? Like‚Ä¶in <i class="calibre7">America</i>?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe what?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome now, Percy. What you call ‚ÄòWestern civilization.‚Äô Do you
            think it‚Äôs just an abstract concept? No, it‚Äôs a living force. A collective consciousness that has
            burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it. You might even say they are the
            source of it, or at least, they are tied so tightly to it that they couldn‚Äôt possible fade, not
            unless all of Western civilization were obliterated. The fire started in Greece. Then, as you well
            know&mdash;or as I hope you know, since you passed my course&mdash;the heart of the fire moved to
            Rome, and so did the gods. Oh, different names, perhaps&mdash; Jupiter for Zeus, Venus for
            Aphrodite, and so on&mdash;but the same forces, the same gods.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd then they died.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDied? No. Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to
            Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several
            centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.
            Every place they‚Äôve ruled, for the last three thousand years, you can see them in paintings, in
            statues, on the most important buildings. And yes, Percy, of course they are now in your United
            States. Look at your symbol, the eagle of Zeus. Look at the statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller
            Center, the Greek facades of your government buildings in Washington. I defy you to find any
            American city where the Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places. Like it or
            not&mdash;and believe me, plenty of people weren‚Äôt very fond of Rome, either&mdash;America is now
            the heart of the flame. It is the great power of the West. And so Olympus is here. And we are here.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was all too much, especially the fact that I seemed to be included in Chiron‚Äôs
            <i class="calibre7">we</i>, as if I were part of some club.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho are you, Chiron? Who‚Ä¶who am I?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron smiled. He shifted his weight as if he were going to get up out of his
            wheelchair, but I knew that was impossible. He was paralyzed from the waist down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the question we all want answered, isn‚Äôt it?
            But for now, we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven. There will be new friends to meet. And plenty
            of time for lessons tomorrow. Besides, there will be s‚Äômores at the campfire tonight, and I simply
            adore chocolate.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">And then he did rise from his wheelchair. But there was something odd about the way
            he did it. His blanket fell away from his legs, but the legs didn‚Äôt move. His waist kept getting
            longer, rising above his belt. At first, I thought he was wearing very long, white velvet underwear,
            but as he kept rising out of the chair, taller than any man, I realized that the velvet underwear
            wasn‚Äôt underwear; it was the front of an animal, muscle and sinew under coarse white fur. And the
            wheelchair wasn‚Äôt a chair. It was some kind of container, an enormous box on wheels, and it must‚Äôve
            been magic, because there‚Äôs no way it could‚Äôve held all of him. A leg came out, long and
            knobby-kneed, with a huge polished hoof. Then another front leg, then hindquarters, and then the box
            was empty, nothing but a metal shell with a couple of fake human legs attached.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre17">I stared at the horse who had just sprung from the
            wheelchair: a huge white stallion. But where its neck should be was the upper body of my Latin
            teacher, smoothly grafted to the horse‚Äôs trunk.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat a relief,‚Äù the centaur said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd been cooped up in there so long, my
            fetlocks had fallen asleep. Now, come, Percy Jackson. Let‚Äôs meet the other campers.‚Äù</p>

          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">O</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">NCE</span> I
            <span class="calibre5">GOT OVER THE FACT THAT</span> my Latin teacher was a horse, we had a nice
            tour, though I was careful not to walk behind him. I‚Äôd done pooper-scooper patrol in the Macy‚Äôs
            Thanksgiving Day Parade a few times, and, I‚Äôm sorry, I did not trust Chiron‚Äôs back end the way I
            trusted his front.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">We passed the volleyball pit. Several of the campers nudged each other. One pointed
            to the minotaur horn I was carrying. Another said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs <i class="calibre7">him</i>.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Most of the campers were older than me. Their satyr friends were bigger than
            Grover, all of them trotting around in orange <span class="calibre5">CAMP HALF-BLOOD</span>
            T-shirts, with nothing else to cover their bare shaggy hindquarters. I wasn‚Äôt normally shy, but the
            way they stared at me made me uncomfortable. I felt like they were expecting me to do a flip or
            something.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked back at the farmhouse. It was a lot bigger than I‚Äôd realized&mdash; four
            stories tall, sky blue with white trim, like an upscale seaside resort. I was checking out the brass
            eagle weather vane on top when something caught my eye, a shadow in the uppermost window of the
            attic gable. Something had moved the curtain, just for a second, and I got the distinct impression I
            was being watched.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up there?‚Äù I asked Chiron.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He looked where I was pointing, and his smile faded. ‚ÄúJust the attic.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomebody lives there?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said with finality. ‚ÄúNot a single living thing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got the feeling he was being truthful. But I was also sure something had moved
            that curtain.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome along, Percy,‚Äù Chiron said, his lighthearted tone now a little forced. ‚ÄúLots
            to see.‚Äù</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">We walked through the strawberry fields, where campers were picking bushels of
            berries while a satyr played a tune on a reed pipe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron told me the camp grew a nice crop for export to New York restaurants and
            Mount Olympus. ‚ÄúIt pays our expenses,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAnd the strawberries take almost no effort.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">He said Mr. D had this effect on fruit-bearing plants: they just went crazy when he
            was around. It worked best with wine grapes, but Mr. D was restricted from growing those, so they
            grew strawberries instead.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I watched the satyr playing his pipe. His music was causing lines of bugs to leave
            the strawberry patch in every direction, like refugees fleeing a fire. I wondered if Grover could
            work that kind of magic with music. I wondered if he was still inside the farmhouse, getting chewed
            out by Mr. D.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover won‚Äôt get in too much trouble, will he?‚Äù I asked Chiron. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶he was a
            good protector. Really.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron sighed. He shed his tweed jacket and draped it over his horse‚Äôs back like a
            saddle. ‚ÄúGrover has big dreams, Percy. Perhaps bigger than are reasonable. To reach his goal, he
            must first demonstrate great courage by succeeding as a keeper, finding a new camper and bringing
            him safely to Half-Blood Hill.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut he did that!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI might agree with you,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúBut it is not my place to judge. Dionysus
            and the Council of Cloven Elders must decide. I‚Äôm afraid they might not see this assignment as a
            success. After all, Grover lost you in New York. Then there‚Äôs the unfortunate‚Ä¶ah‚Ä¶fate of your
            mother. And the fact that Grover was unconscious when you dragged him over the property line. The
            council might question whether this shows any courage on Grover‚Äôs part.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre17">I wanted to protest. None of what happened was Grover‚Äôs
            fault. I also felt really, really guilty. If I hadn‚Äôt given Grover the slip at the bus station, he
            might not have gotten in trouble.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôll get a second chance, won‚Äôt he?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron winced. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that <i class="calibre7">was</i> Grover‚Äôs second chance,
            Percy. The council was not anxious to give him another, either, after what happened the first time,
            five years ago. Olympus knows, I advised him to wait longer before trying again. He‚Äôs still so small
            for his age‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow old is he?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, twenty-eight.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat! And he‚Äôs in sixth grade?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSatyrs mature half as fast as humans, Percy. Grover has been the equivalent of a
            middle school student for the past six years.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs horrible.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúQuite,‚Äù Chiron agreed. ‚ÄúAt any rate, Grover is a late bloomer, even by satyr
            standards, and not yet very accomplished at woodland magic. Alas, he was anxious to pursue his
            dream. Perhaps now he will find some other career‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat happened the first time? Was it really so bad?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron looked away quickly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move along, shall we?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre17">But I wasn‚Äôt quite ready to let the subject drop. Something
            had occurred to me when Chiron talked about my mother‚Äôs fate, as if he were intentionally avoiding
            the word <i class="calibre7">death</i>. The beginnings of an idea&mdash;a tiny, hopeful fire&mdash;
            started forming in my mind.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúChiron,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf the gods and Olympus and all that are real‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, child?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDoes that mean the Underworld is real, too?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron‚Äôs expression darkened.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, child.‚Äù He paused, as if choosing his words carefully. ‚ÄúThere is a place
            where spirits go after death. But for now‚Ä¶until we know more‚Ä¶I would urge you to put that out of
            your mind.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòuntil we know more‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome, Percy. Let‚Äôs see the woods.‚Äù</p>

          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">As we got closer, I realized how huge the forest was. It took up at least a quarter
            of the valley, with trees so tall and thick, you could imagine nobody had been in there since the
            Native Americans.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron said, ‚ÄúThe woods are stocked, if you care to try your luck, but go armed.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúStocked with what?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúArmed with what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see. Capture the flag is Friday night. Do you have your own sword and
            shield?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy own&mdash;?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you do. I think a size five will do. I‚Äôll visit
            the armory later.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to ask what kind of summer camp had an armory, but there was too much else
            to think about, so the tour continued. We saw the archery range, the canoeing lake, the stables
            (which Chiron didn‚Äôt seem to like very much), the javelin range, the sing-along amphitheater, and
            the arena where Chiron said they held sword and spear fights.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSword and spear fights?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCabin challenges and all that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúNot lethal. Usually. Oh, yes, and
            there‚Äôs the mess hall.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron pointed to an outdoor pavilion framed in white Grecian columns on a hill
            overlooking the sea. There were a dozen stone picnic tables. No roof. No walls.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you do when it rains?‚Äù I asked,</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre17">Chiron looked at me as if I‚Äôd gone a little weird. ‚ÄúWe still
            have to eat, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù I decided to drop the subject.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, he showed me the cabins. There were twelve of them, nestled in the woods
            by the lake. They were arranged in a U, with two at the base and five in a row on either side. And
            they were without doubt the most bizarre collection of buildings I‚Äôd ever seen.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Except for the fact that each had a large brass number above the door (odds on the
            left side, evens on the right), they looked absolutely nothing alike. Number nine had smokestacks,
            like a tiny factory. Number four had tomato vines on the walls and a roof made out of real grass.
            Seven seemed to be made of solid gold, which gleamed so much in the sunlight it was almost
            impossible to look at. They all faced a commons area about the size of a soccer field, dotted with
            Greek statues, fountains, flower beds, and a couple of basketball hoops (which were more my speed).
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">In the center of the field was a huge stone-lined firepit. Even though it was a
            warm afternoon, the hearth smoldered. A girl about nine years old was tending the flames, poking the
            coals with a stick.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The pair of cabins at the head of the field, numbers one and two, looked like
            his-and-hers mausoleums, big white marble boxes with heavy columns in front. Cabin one was the
            biggest and bulkiest of the twelve. Its polished bronze doors shimmered like a hologram, so that
            from different angles lightning bolts seemed to streak across them. Cabin two was more graceful
            somehow, with slimmer columns garlanded with pomegranates and flowers. The walls were carved with
            images of peacocks.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre17">‚ÄúZeus and Hera?‚Äù I guessed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù Chiron said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTheir cabins look empty.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSeveral of the cabins are. That‚Äôs true. No one ever stays in one or two.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Okay. So each cabin had a different god, like a mascot. Twelve cabins for the
            twelve Olympians. But why would some be empty?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stopped in front of the first cabin on the left, cabin three.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It wasn‚Äôt high and mighty like cabin one, but long and low and solid. The outer
            walls were rough gray stone studded with pieces of seashell and coral, as if the slabs had been hewn
            straight from the bottom of the ocean floor. I peeked inside the open doorway and Chiron said, ‚ÄúOh,
            I wouldn‚Äôt do that!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before he could pull me back, I caught the salty scent of the interior, like the
            wind on the shore at Montauk. The interior walls glowed like abalone. There were six empty bunk beds
            with silk sheets turned down. But there was no sign anyone had ever slept there. The place felt so
            sad and lonely, I was glad when Chiron put his hand on my shoulder and said, ‚ÄúCome along, Percy.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Most of the other cabins were crowded with campers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Number five was bright red&mdash;a real nasty paint job, as if the color had been
            splashed on with buckets and fists. The roof was lined with barbed wire. A stuffed wild boar‚Äôs head
            hung over the doorway, and its eyes seemed to follow me. Inside I could see a bunch of mean-looking
            kids, both girls and boys, arm wrestling and arguing with each other while rock music blared. The
            loudest was a girl maybe thirteen or fourteen. She wore a size XXXL <span class="calibre5">CAMP
              HALF-BLOOD</span> T-shirt under a camouflage jacket. She zeroed in on me and gave me an evil
            sneer. She reminded me of Nancy Bobofit, though the camper girl was much bigger and tougher looking,
            and her hair was long and stringy, and brown instead of red.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I kept walking, trying to stay clear of Chiron‚Äôs hooves. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen any other
            centaurs,‚Äù I observed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Chiron sadly. ‚ÄúMy kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk, I‚Äôm afraid. You
            might encounter them in the wilderness, or at major sporting events. But you won‚Äôt see any here.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou said your name was Chiron. Are you really‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He smiled down at me. ‚Äú<i class="calibre7">The</i> Chiron from the stories? Trainer
            of Hercules and all that? Yes, Percy, I am.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut shouldn‚Äôt you be dead?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre17">Chiron paused, as if the question intrigued him. ‚ÄúI honestly
            don‚Äôt know about <i class="calibre7">should</i> be. The truth is, I <i class="calibre7">can‚Äôt</i> be
            dead. You see, eons ago the gods granted my wish. I could continue the work I loved. I could be a
            teacher of heroes as long as humanity needed me. I gained much from that wish‚Ä¶and I gave up much.
            But I‚Äôm still here, so I can only assume I‚Äôm still needed.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about being a teacher for three thousand years. It wouldn‚Äôt have made my
            Top Ten Things to Wish For list.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt it ever get boring?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHorribly depressing, at times, but never boring.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy depressing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron seemed to turn hard of hearing again.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, look,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnnabeth is waiting for us.‚Äù</p>

          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The blond girl I‚Äôd met at the Big House was reading a book in front of the last
            cabin on the left, number eleven.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When we reached her, she looked me over critically, like she was still thinking
            about how much I drooled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to see what she was reading, but I couldn‚Äôt make out the title. I thought
            my dyslexia was acting up. Then I realized the title wasn‚Äôt even English. The letters looked Greek
            to me. I mean, literally Greek. There were pictures of temples and statues and different kinds of
            columns, like those in an architecture book.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnnabeth,‚Äù Chiron said, ‚ÄúI have masters‚Äô archery class at noon. Would you take
            Percy from here?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCabin eleven,‚Äù Chiron told me, gesturing toward the doorway. ‚ÄúMake yourself at
            home.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Out of all the cabins, eleven looked the most like a regular summer camp cabin,
            with the emphasis on <i class="calibre7">old</i>. The threshold was worn down, the brown paint
            peeling. Over the doorway was one of those doctor‚Äôs symbols, a winged pole with two snakes wrapped
            around it. What did they call it‚Ä¶? A caduceus.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Inside, it was packed with people, both boys and girls, way more than the number of
            bunk beds. Sleeping bags were spread all over on the floor. It looked like a gym where the Red Cross
            had set up an evacuation center.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre17">Chiron didn‚Äôt go in. The door was too low for him. But when
            the campers saw him they all stood and bowed respectfully.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, then,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúGood luck, Percy. I‚Äôll see you at dinner.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He galloped away toward the archery range.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stood in the doorway, looking at the kids. They weren‚Äôt bowing anymore. They were
            staring at me, sizing me up. I knew this routine. I‚Äôd gone though it at enough schools.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Annabeth prompted. ‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">So naturally I tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself. There
            were some snickers from the campers, but none of them said anything.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth announced, ‚ÄúPercy Jackson, meet cabin eleven.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRegular or undetermined?‚Äù somebody asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt know what to say, but Annabeth said, ‚ÄúUndetermined.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Everybody groaned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A guy who was a little older than the rest came forward. ‚ÄúNow, now, campers. That‚Äôs
            what we‚Äôre here for. Welcome, Percy. You can have that spot on the floor, right over there.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The guy was about nineteen, and he looked pretty cool. He was tall and muscular,
            with short-cropped sandy hair and a friendly smile. He wore an orange tank top, cutoffs, sandals,
            and a leather necklace with five different-colored clay beads. The only thing unsettling about his
            appearance was a thick white scar that ran from just beneath his right eye to his jaw, like an old
            knife slash.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis is Luke,‚Äù Annabeth said, and her voice sounded
            different somehow. I glanced over and could‚Äôve sworn she was blushing. She saw me looking, and her
            expression hardened again. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your counselor for now.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFor now?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre undetermined,‚Äù Luke explained patiently. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know what cabin to put
            you in, so you‚Äôre here. Cabin eleven takes all newcomers, all visitors. Naturally, we would. Hermes,
            our patron, is the god of travelers.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at the tiny section of floor they‚Äôd given me. I had nothing to put there
            to mark it as my own, no luggage, no clothes, no sleeping bag. Just the Minotaur‚Äôs horn. I thought
            about setting that down, but then I remembered that Hermes was also the god of thieves.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked around at the campers‚Äô faces, some sullen and suspicious, some grinning
            stupidly, some eyeing me as if they were waiting for a chance to pick my pockets.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow long will I be here?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood question,‚Äù Luke said. ‚ÄúUntil you‚Äôre determined.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow long will that take?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The campers all laughed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Annabeth told me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you the volleyball court.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve already seen it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She grabbed my wrist and dragged me outside. I could hear the kids of cabin eleven
            laughing behind me.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">When we were a few feet away, Annabeth said, ‚ÄúJackson, you have to do better than
            that.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She rolled her eyes and mumbled under her breath, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I thought you
            were the one.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your problem?‚Äù I was getting angry now. ‚ÄúAll I know is, I kill some bull
            guy&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk like that!‚Äù Annabeth told me. ‚ÄúYou know how many kids at this camp wish
            they‚Äôd had your chance?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTo get killed?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTo fight the Minotaur! What do you think we train for?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre17">I shook my head. ‚ÄúLook, if the thing I fought really was <i
              class="calibre7">the</i> Minotaur, the same one in the stories‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs only one.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd he died, like, a gajillion years ago, right? Theseus killed him in the
            labyrinth. So‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMonsters don‚Äôt die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don‚Äôt die.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, thanks. That clears it up.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have souls like you and me. You can dispel them for a while, maybe even
            for a whole lifetime if you‚Äôre lucky. But they are primal forces. Chiron calls them archetypes.
            Eventually, they re-form.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about Mrs. Dodds. ‚ÄúYou mean if I killed one, accidentally, with a
            sword&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Fur‚Ä¶I mean, your math teacher. That‚Äôs right. She‚Äôs still out there. You just
            made her very, very mad.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow did you know about Mrs. Dodds?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou talk in your sleep.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou almost called her something. A Fury? They‚Äôre Hades‚Äôs torturers, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth glanced nervously at the ground, as if she expected it to open up and
            swallow her. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt call them by name, even here. We call them the Kindly Ones, if we have
            to speak of them at all.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLook, is there anything we <i class="calibre7">can</i> say without it thundering?‚Äù
            I sounded whiny, even to myself, but right then I didn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúWhy do I have to stay in cabin
            eleven, anyway? Why is everybody so crowded together? There are plenty of empty bunks right over
            there.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I pointed to the first few cabins, and Annabeth turned pale. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt just choose
            a cabin, Percy. It depends on who your parents are. Or‚Ä¶your parent.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She stared at me, waiting for me to get it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy mom is Sally Jackson,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe works at the candy store in Grand Central
            Station. At least, she used to.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about your mom, Percy. But that‚Äôs not what I mean. I‚Äôm talking about
            your other parent. Your dad.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead. I never knew him.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre17">Annabeth sighed. Clearly, she‚Äôd had this conversation before
            with other kids. ‚ÄúYour father‚Äôs not dead, Percy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow can you say that? You know him?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo, of course not.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen how can you say&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause I know <i class="calibre7">you</i>. You wouldn‚Äôt be here if you weren‚Äôt
            one of us.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know anything about me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo?‚Äù She raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúI bet you moved around from school to school. I bet
            you were kicked out of a lot of them.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDiagnosed with dyslexia. Probably ADHD, too.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to swallow my embarrassment. ‚ÄúWhat does that have to do with anything?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTaken together, it‚Äôs almost a sure sign. The letters float off the page when you
            read, right? That‚Äôs because your mind is hardwired for ancient Greek. And the ADHD&mdash;you‚Äôre
            impulsive, can‚Äôt sit still in the classroom. That‚Äôs your battlefield reflexes. In a real fight,
            they‚Äôd keep you alive. As for the attention problems, that‚Äôs because you see too much, Percy, not
            too little. Your senses are better than a regular mortal‚Äôs. Of course the teachers want you
            medicated. Most of them are monsters. They don‚Äôt want you seeing them for what they are.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou sound like‚Ä¶you went through the same thing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMost of the kids here did. If you weren‚Äôt like us, you couldn‚Äôt have survived the
            Minotaur, much less the ambrosia and nectar.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAmbrosia and nectar.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe food and drink we were giving you to make you better. That stuff would‚Äôve
            killed a normal kid. It would‚Äôve turned your blood to fire and your bones to sand and you‚Äôd be dead.
            Face it. You‚Äôre a half-blood.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A half-blood.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was reeling with so many questions I didn‚Äôt know where to start.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then a husky voice yelled, ‚ÄúWell! A newbie!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked over. The big girl from the ugly red cabin was sauntering toward us. She
            had three other girls behind her, all big and ugly and mean looking like her, all wearing camo
            jackets.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúClarisse,‚Äù Annabeth sighed. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go polish your spear or something?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre17">‚ÄúSure, Miss Princess,‚Äù the big girl said. ‚ÄúSo I can run you
            through with it Friday night.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúErre es korakas!‚Äù</i> Annabeth said, which I somehow
            understood was Greek for ‚ÄúGo to the crows!‚Äù though I had a feeling it was a worse curse than it
            sounded. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt stand a chance.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll pulverize you,‚Äù Clarisse said, but her eye twitched. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt sure
            she could follow through on the threat. She turned toward me. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this little runt?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy Jackson,‚Äù Annabeth said, ‚Äúmeet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I blinked. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶the war god?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Clarisse sneered. ‚ÄúYou got a problem with that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, recovering my wits. ‚ÄúIt explains the bad smell.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Clarisse growled. ‚ÄúWe got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhatever. Come on, I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúClarisse&mdash;‚Äù Annabeth tried to say.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúStay out of it, Wise Girl.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth looked pained, but she did stay out of it, and I didn‚Äôt really want her
            help. I was the new kid. I had to earn my own rep.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I handed Annabeth my minotaur horn and got ready to fight, but before I knew it,
            Clarisse had me by the neck and was dragging me toward a cinder-block building that I knew
            immediately was the bathroom.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was kicking and punching. I‚Äôd been in plenty of fights before, but this big girl
            Clarisse had hands like iron. She dragged me into the girls‚Äô bathroom. There was a line of toilets
            on one side and a line of shower stalls down the other. It smelled just like any public bathroom,
            and I was thinking &mdash;as much as I <i class="calibre7">could</i> think with Clarisse ripping my
            hair out&mdash;that if this place belonged to the gods, they should‚Äôve been able to afford classier
            johns.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Clarisse‚Äôs friends were all laughing, and I was trying to find the strength I‚Äôd
            used to fight the Minotaur, but it just wasn‚Äôt there.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLike he‚Äôs ‚ÄòBig Three‚Äô material,‚Äù Clarisse said as she pushed me toward one of the
            toilets. ‚ÄúYeah, right. Minotaur probably fell over laughing, he was so stupid looking.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her friends snickered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth stood in the corner, watching through her fingers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Clarisse bent me over on my knees and started pushing my head toward the toilet
            bowl. It reeked like rusted pipes and, well, like what goes into toilets. I strained to keep my head
            up. I was looking at the scummy water, thinking, I will not go into that. I won‚Äôt.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre17">Then something happened. I felt a tug in the pit of my
            stomach. I heard the plumbing rumble, the pipes shudder. Clarisse‚Äôs grip on my hair loosened. Water
            shot out of the toilet, making an arc straight over my head, and the next thing I knew, I was
            sprawled on the bathroom tiles with Clarisse screaming behind me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned just as water blasted out of the toilet again, hitting Clarisse straight
            in the face so hard it pushed her down onto her butt. The water stayed on her like the spray from a
            fire hose, pushing her backward into a shower stall.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She struggled, gasping, and her friends started coming toward her. But then the
            other toilets exploded, too, and six more streams of toilet water blasted them back. The showers
            acted up, too, and together all the fixtures sprayed the camouflage girls right out of the bathroom,
            spinning them around like pieces of garbage being washed away.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As soon as they were out the door, I felt the tug in my gut lessen, and the water
            shut off as quickly as it had started.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The entire bathroom was flooded. Annabeth hadn‚Äôt been spared. She was dripping wet,
            but she hadn‚Äôt been pushed out the door. She was standing in exactly the same place, staring at me
            in shock.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked down and realized I was sitting in the only dry spot in the whole room.
            There was a circle of dry floor around me. I didn‚Äôt have one drop of water on my clothes. Nothing.
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-118" class="calibre17">I stood up, my legs shaky.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúHow did you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We walked to the door. Outside, Clarisse and her friends were sprawled in the mud,
            and a bunch of other campers had gathered around to gawk. Clarisse‚Äôs hair was flattened across her
            face. Her camouflage jacket was sopping and she smelled like sewage. She gave me a look of absolute
            hatred. ‚ÄúYou are dead, new boy. You are totally dead.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I probably should have let it go, but I said, ‚ÄúYou want to gargle with toilet water
            again, Clarisse? Close your mouth.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her friends had to hold her back. They dragged her toward cabin five, while the
            other campers made way to avoid her flailing feet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth stared at me. I couldn‚Äôt tell whether she was just grossed out or angry at
            me for dousing her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I demanded. ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthat I want you on my team for capture the flag.‚Äù</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 7: MY DINNER GOES UP IN SMOKE</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">W</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">ORD OF THE
              BATHROOM INCIDENT</span> spread immediately. Wherever I went, campers pointed at me and murmured
            something about toilet water. Or maybe they were just staring at Annabeth, who was still pretty much
            dripping wet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She showed me a few more places: the metal shop (where kids were forging their own
            swords), the arts-and-crafts room (where satyrs were sandblasting a giant marble statue of a
            goat-man), and the climbing wall, which actually consisted of two facing walls that shook violently,
            dropped boulders, sprayed lava, and clashed together if you didn‚Äôt get to the top fast enough.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally we returned to the canoeing lake, where the trail led back to the cabins.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve got training to do,‚Äù Annabeth said flatly. ‚ÄúDinner‚Äôs at seven-thirty. Just
            follow your cabin to the mess hall.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnnabeth, I‚Äôm sorry about the toilets.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt my fault.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre17">She looked at me skeptically, and I realized it <i
              class="calibre7">was</i> my fault. I‚Äôd made water shoot out of the bathroom fixtures. I didn‚Äôt
            understand how. But the toilets had responded to me. I had become one with the plumbing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou need to talk to the Oracle,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot who. What. The Oracle. I‚Äôll ask Chiron.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared into the lake, wishing somebody would give me a straight answer for once.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt expecting anybody to be looking back at me from the bottom, so my heart
            skipped a beat when I noticed two teenage girls sitting cross-legged at the base of the pier, about
            twenty feet below. They wore blue jeans and shimmering green T-shirts, and their brown hair floated
            loose around their shoulders as minnows darted in and out. They smiled and waved as if I were a
            long-lost friend.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. I waved back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt encourage them,‚Äù Annabeth warned. ‚ÄúNaiads are terrible flirts.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNaiads,‚Äù I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. I want to go home
            now.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth frowned. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you get it, Percy? You <i class="calibre7">are</i> home.
            This is the only safe place on earth for kids like us.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou mean, mentally disturbed kids?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI mean <i class="calibre7">not human</i>. Not totally human, anyway. Half-human.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHalf-human and half-what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI think you know.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt want to admit it, but I was afraid I did. I felt a tingling in my limbs, a
            sensation I sometimes felt when my mom talked about my dad,</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGod,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHalf-god.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth nodded. ‚ÄúYour father isn‚Äôt dead, Percy. He‚Äôs one of the Olympians.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶crazy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIs it? What‚Äôs the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around
            falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they‚Äôve changed their habits in
            the last few millennia?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut those are just&mdash;‚Äù I almost said <i class="calibre7">myths</i> again. Then
            I remembered Chiron‚Äôs warning that in two thousand years, <i class="calibre7">I</i> might be
            considered a myth. ‚ÄúBut if all the kids here are half-gods&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDemigods,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the official term. Or half-bloods.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-120" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen who‚Äôs your dad?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her hands tightened around the pier railing. I got the feeling I‚Äôd just trespassed
            on a sensitive subject.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy dad is a professor at West Point,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen him since I was
            very small. He teaches American history.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs human.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How
            sexist is that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your mom, then?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCabin six.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMeaning?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth straightened. ‚ÄúAthena. Goddess of wisdom and battle.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Okay, I thought. Why not?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd my dad?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUndetermined,‚Äù Annabeth said, ‚Äúlike I told you before. Nobody knows.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúExcept my mother. She knew.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMaybe not, Percy. Gods don‚Äôt always reveal their identities.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy dad would have. He loved her.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth gave me a cautious look. She didn‚Äôt want to burst my bubble. ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre
            right. Maybe he‚Äôll send a sign. That‚Äôs the only way to know for sure: your father has to send you a
            sign claiming you as his son. Sometimes it happens.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou mean sometimes it doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth ran her palm along the rail. ‚ÄúThe gods are busy. They have a lot of kids
            and they don‚Äôt always‚Ä¶Well, sometimes they don‚Äôt care about us, Percy. They ignore us.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about some of the kids I‚Äôd seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked
            sullen and depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come. I‚Äôd known kids like
            that at Yancy Academy, shuffled off to boarding school by rich parents who didn‚Äôt have the time to
            deal with them. But gods should behave better.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm stuck here,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it? For the rest of my life?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt depends,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúSome campers only stay for the summer. If you‚Äôre a
            child of Aphrodite or Demeter, you‚Äôre probably not a real powerful force. The monsters might ignore
            you, so you can get by with a few months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of
            the year. But for some of us, it‚Äôs too dangerous to leave. We‚Äôre year-rounders. In the mortal world,
            we attract monsters. They sense us. They come to challenge us. Most of the time, they‚Äôll ignore us
            until we‚Äôre old enough to cause trouble&mdash;about ten or eleven years old, but after that, most
            demigods either make their way here, or they get killed off. A few manage to survive in the outside
            world and become famous. Believe me, if I told you the names, you‚Äôd know them. Some don‚Äôt even
            realize they‚Äôre demigods. But very, very few are like that.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-121" class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo monsters can‚Äôt get in here?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth shook her head. ‚ÄúNot unless they‚Äôre intentionally stocked in the woods or
            specially summoned by somebody on the inside.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy would anybody want to summon a monster?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPractice fights. Practical jokes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPractical jokes?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe point is, the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out. From the
            outside, mortals look into the valley and see nothing unusual, just a strawberry farm.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶you‚Äôre a year-rounder?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth nodded. From under the collar of her T-shirt, she pulled a leather
            necklace with five clay beads of different colors. It was just like Luke‚Äôs, except Annabeth‚Äôs also
            had a big gold ring strung on it, like a college ring.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here since I was seven,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEvery August, on the last day of
            summer session, you get a bead for surviving another year. I‚Äôve been here longer than most of the
            counselors, and they‚Äôre all in college.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy did you come so young?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She twisted the ring on her necklace. ‚ÄúNone of your business.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-122" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I stood there for a minute in uncomfortable silence.
            ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶I could just walk out of here right now if I wanted to?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt would be suicide, but you could, with Mr. D‚Äôs or Chiron‚Äôs permission. But they
            wouldn‚Äôt give permission until the end of the summer session unless‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUnless?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou were granted a quest. But that hardly ever happens. The last time‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her voice trailed off. I could tell from her tone that the last time hadn‚Äôt gone
            well.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBack in the sick room,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhen you were feeding me that stuff&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAmbrosia.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah. You asked me something about the summer solstice.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth‚Äôs shoulders tensed. ‚ÄúSo you <i class="calibre7">do</i> know something?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no. Back at my old school, I overheard Grover and Chiron talking about it.
            Grover mentioned the summer solstice. He said something like we didn‚Äôt have much time, because of
            the deadline. What did that mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She clenched her fists. ‚ÄúI wish I knew. Chiron and the satyrs, they know, but they
            won‚Äôt tell me. Something is wrong in Olympus, something pretty major. Last time I was there,
            everything seemed so <i class="calibre7">normal</i>.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been to Olympus?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSome of us year-rounders&mdash;Luke and Clarisse and I and a few others&mdash; we
            took a field trip during winter solstice. That‚Äôs when the gods have their big annual council.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶how did you get there?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Long Island Railroad, of course. You get off at Penn Station. Empire State
            Building, special elevator to the six hundredth floor.‚Äù She looked at me like she was sure I must
            know this already. ‚ÄúYou <i class="calibre7">are</i> a New Yorker, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, sure.‚Äù As far as I knew, there were only a hundred and two floors in the
            Empire State Building, but I decided not to point that out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRight after we visited,‚Äù Annabeth continued, ‚Äúthe weather got weird, as if the
            gods had started fighting. A couple of times since, I‚Äôve overheard satyrs talking. The best I can
            figure out is that something important was stolen. And if it isn‚Äôt returned by summer solstice,
            there‚Äôs going to be trouble. When you came, I was hoping‚Ä¶I mean&mdash;Athena can get along with just
            about anybody, except for Ares. And of course she‚Äôs got the rivalry with Poseidon. But, I mean,
            aside from that, I thought we could work together. I thought you might know something.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-123" class="calibre17">I shook my head. I wished I could help her, but I felt too
            hungry and tired and mentally overloaded to ask any more questions.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to get a quest,‚Äù Annabeth muttered to herself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm <i class="calibre7">not</i>
            too young. If they would just tell me the problem‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I could smell barbecue smoke coming from somewhere nearby. Annabeth must‚Äôve heard
            my stomach growl. She told me to go on, she‚Äôd catch me later. I left her on the pier, tracing her
            finger across the rail as if drawing a battle plan.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Back at cabin eleven, everybody was talking and horsing around, waiting for dinner.
            For the first time, I noticed that a lot of the campers had similar features: sharp noses, upturned
            eyebrows, mischievous smiles. They were the kind of kids that teachers would peg as troublemakers.
            Thankfully, nobody paid much attention to me as I walked over to my spot on the floor and plopped
            down with my minotaur horn.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The counselor, Luke, came over. He had the Hermes family resemblance, too. It was
            marred by that scar on his right cheek, but his smile was intact.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFound you a sleeping bag,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd here, I stole you some toiletries from
            the camp store.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was kidding about the stealing part.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo prob.‚Äù Luke sat next to me, pushed his back against the wall. ‚ÄúTough first
            day?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong here,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even believe in gods.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how we all started. Once you start believing in them? It
            doesn‚Äôt get any easier.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bitterness in his voice surprised me, because Luke seemed like a pretty
            easygoing guy. He looked like he could handle just about anything.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo your dad is Hermes?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He pulled a switchblade out of his back pocket, and for a second I thought he was
            going to gut me, but he just scraped the mud off the sole of his sandal. ‚ÄúYeah. Hermes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe wing-footed messenger guy.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him. Messengers. Medicine. Travelers, merchants,
            thieves. Anybody who uses the roads. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here, enjoying cabin eleven‚Äôs hospitality.
            Hermes isn‚Äôt picky about who he sponsors.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I figured Luke didn‚Äôt mean to call me a nobody. He just had a lot on his mind.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou ever meet your dad?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOnce.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I waited, thinking that if he wanted to tell me, he‚Äôd tell me. Apparently, he
            didn‚Äôt. I wondered if the story had anything to do with how he got his scar.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke looked up and managed a smile. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, Percy. The campers here,
            they‚Äôre mostly good people. After all, we‚Äôre extended family, right? We take care of each other.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">He seemed to understand how lost I felt, and I was grateful for that, because an
            older guy like him&mdash;even if he was a counselor&mdash;should‚Äôve steered clear of an uncool
            middle-schooler like me. But Luke had welcomed me into the cabin. He‚Äôd even stolen me some
            toiletries, which was the nicest thing anybody had done for me all day.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre17">I decided to ask him my last big question, the one that had
            been bothering me all afternoon. ‚ÄúClarisse, from Ares, was joking about me being ‚ÄòBig Three‚Äô
            material. Then Annabeth‚Ä¶twice, she said I might be ‚Äòthe one.‚Äô She said I should talk to the Oracle.
            What was that all about?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke folded his knife. ‚ÄúI hate prophecies.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His face twisted around the scar. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I messed things up for everybody
            else. The last two years, ever since my trip to the Garden of the Hesperides went sour, Chiron
            hasn‚Äôt allowed any more quests. Annabeth‚Äôs been dying to get out into the world. She pestered Chiron
            so much he finally told her he already knew her fate. He‚Äôd had a prophecy from the Oracle. He
            wouldn‚Äôt tell her the whole thing, but he said Annabeth wasn‚Äôt destined to go on a quest yet. She
            had to wait until‚Ä¶somebody special came to the camp.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomebody special?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, kid,‚Äù Luke said. ‚ÄúAnnabeth wants to think every new camper
            who comes through here is the omen she‚Äôs been waiting for. Now, come on, it‚Äôs dinnertime.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The moment he said it, a horn blew in the distance. Somehow, I knew it was a conch
            shell, even though I‚Äôd never heard it before.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke yelled, ‚ÄúEleven, fall in!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The whole cabin, about twenty of us, filed into the commons yard. We lined up in
            order of seniority, so of course I was dead last. Campers came from the other cabins, too, except
            for the last three empty cabins at the end, and cabin eight, which had looked normal in the daytime,
            but was now starting to glow silver as the sun went down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We marched up the hill to the mess hall pavilion. Satyrs joined us from the meadow.
            Naiads emerged from the canoeing lake. A few other girls came out of the woods&mdash;and when I say
            out of the woods, I mean <i class="calibre7">straight</i> out of the woods. I saw one girl, about
            nine or ten years old, melt from the side of a maple tree and come skipping up the hill.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In all, there were maybe a hundred campers, a few dozen satyrs, and a dozen
            assorted wood nymphs and naiads.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">At the pavilion, torches blazed around the marble columns. A central fire burned in
            a bronze brazier the size of a bathtub. Each cabin had its own table, covered in white cloth trimmed
            in purple. Four of the tables were empty, but cabin eleven‚Äôs was way overcrowded. I had to squeeze
            onto the edge of a bench with half my butt hanging off.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre17">I saw Grover sitting at table twelve with Mr. D, a few
            satyrs, and a couple of plump blond boys who looked just like Mr. D. Chiron stood to one side, the
            picnic table being way too small for a centaur.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth sat at table six with a bunch of serious-looking athletic kids, all with
            gray eyes and honey-blond hair.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Clarisse sat behind me at Ares‚Äôs table. She‚Äôd apparently gotten over being hosed
            down, because she was laughing and belching right alongside her friends.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, Chiron pounded his hoof against the marble floor of the pavilion, and
            everybody fell silent. He raised a glass. ‚ÄúTo the gods!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Everybody else raised their glasses. ‚ÄúTo the gods!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Wood nymphs came forward with platters of food: grapes, apples, strawberries,
            cheese, fresh bread, and yes, barbecue! My glass was empty, but Luke said, ‚ÄúSpeak to it. Whatever
            you want&mdash;nonalcoholic, of course.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúCherry Coke.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The glass filled with sparkling caramel liquid.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I had an idea. ‚Äú<i class="calibre7">Blue</i> Cherry Coke.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The soda turned a violent shade of cobalt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took a cautious sip. Perfect.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I drank a toast to my mother.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She‚Äôs not gone, I told myself. Not permanently, anyway. She‚Äôs in the Underworld.
            And if that‚Äôs a real place, then someday‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHere you go, Percy,‚Äù Luke said, handing me a platter of smoked brisket.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I loaded my plate and was about to take a big bite when I noticed everybody getting
            up, carrying their plates toward the fire in the center of the pavilion. I wondered if they were
            going for dessert or something.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Luke told me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As I got closer, I saw that everyone was taking a portion of their meal and
            dropping it into the fire, the ripest strawberry, the juiciest slice of beef, the warmest, most
            buttery roll.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke murmured in my ear, ‚ÄúBurnt offerings for the gods. They like the smell.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His look warned me not to take this lightly, but I couldn‚Äôt help wondering why an
            immortal, all-powerful being would like the smell of burning food.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre17">Luke approached the fire, bowed his head, and tossed in a
            cluster of fat red grapes. ‚ÄúHermes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was next.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wished I knew what god‚Äôs name to say.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, I made a silent plea. <i class="calibre7">Whoever you are, tell me.
              Please.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I scraped a big slice of brisket into the flames.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When I caught a whiff of the smoke, I didn‚Äôt gag.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It smelled nothing like burning food. It smelled of hot chocolate and fresh-baked
            brownies, hamburgers on the grill and wildflowers, and a hundred other good things that shouldn‚Äôt
            have gone well together, but did. I could almost believe the gods could live off that smoke.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When everybody had returned to their seats and finished eating their meals, Chiron
            pounded his hoof again for our attention.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mr. D got up with a huge sigh. ‚ÄúYes, I suppose I‚Äôd better say hello to all you
            brats. Well, hello. Our activities director, Chiron, says the next capture the flag is Friday. Cabin
            five presently holds the laurels.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A bunch of ugly cheering rose from the Ares table.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPersonally,‚Äù Mr. D continued, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt care less, but congratulations. Also, I
            should tell you that we have a new camper today. Peter Johnson.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron murmured something.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúEr, Percy Jackson,‚Äù Mr. D corrected. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Hurrah, and all that. Now run
            along to your silly campfire. Go on.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Everybody cheered. We all headed down toward the amphitheater, where Apollo‚Äôs cabin
            led a sing-along. We sang camp songs about the gods and ate s‚Äômores and joked around, and the funny
            thing was, I didn‚Äôt feel that anyone was staring at me anymore. I felt that I was home.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Later in the evening, when the sparks from the campfire were curling into a starry
            sky, the conch horn blew again, and we all filed back to our cabins. I didn‚Äôt realize how exhausted
            I was until I collapsed on my borrowed sleeping bag.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My fingers curled around the Minotaur‚Äôs horn. I thought about my mom, but I had
            good thoughts: her smile, the bedtime stories she would read me when I was a kid, the way she would
            tell me not to let the bedbugs bite.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When I closed my eyes, I fell asleep instantly.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That was my first day at Camp Half-Blood.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wish I‚Äôd known how briefly I would get to enjoy my new home.</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 8: WE CAPTURE A FLAG</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">T</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">HE NEXT FEW
              DAYS</span> I <span class="calibre5">SETTLED INTO</span> a routine that felt almost normal, if
            you don‚Äôt count the fact that I was getting lessons from satyrs, nymphs, and a centaur.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Each morning I took Ancient Greek from Annabeth, and we talked about the gods and
            goddesses in the present tense, which was kind of weird. I discovered Annabeth was right about my
            dyslexia: Ancient Greek wasn‚Äôt that hard for me to read. At least, no harder than English. After a
            couple of mornings, I could stumble through a few lines of Homer without too much headache.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The rest of the day, I‚Äôd rotate through outdoor activities, looking for something I
            was good at. Chiron tried to teach me archery, but we found out pretty quick I wasn‚Äôt any good with
            a bow and arrow. He didn‚Äôt complain, even when he had to desnag a stray arrow out of his tail.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre17">Foot racing? No good either. The wood-nymph instructors left
            me in the dust. They told me not to worry about it. They‚Äôd had centuries of practice running away
            from lovesick gods. But still, it was a little humiliating to be slower than a tree.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">And wrestling? Forget it. Every time I got on the mat, Clarisse would pulverize me.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more where that came from, punk,‚Äù she‚Äôd mumble in my ear.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The only thing I really excelled at was canoeing, and that wasn‚Äôt the kind of
            heroic skill people expected to see from the kid who had beaten the Minotaur.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I knew the senior campers and counselors were watching me, trying to decide who my
            dad was, but they weren‚Äôt having an easy time of it. I wasn‚Äôt as strong as the Ares kids, or as good
            at archery as the Apollo kids. I didn‚Äôt have Hephaestus‚Äôs skill with metalwork or&mdash;gods
            forbid&mdash;Dionysus‚Äôs way with vine plants. Luke told me I might be a child of Hermes, a kind of
            jack-of-all-trades, master of none. But I got the feeling he was just trying to make me feel better.
            He really didn‚Äôt know what to make of me either.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Despite all that, I liked camp. I got used to the morning fog over the beach, the
            smell of hot strawberry fields in the afternoon, even the weird noises of monsters in the woods at
            night. I would eat dinner with cabin eleven, scrape part of my meal into the fire, and try to feel
            some connection to my real dad. Nothing came. Just that warm feeling I‚Äôd always had, like the memory
            of his smile. I tried not to think too much about my mom, but I kept wondering: if gods and monsters
            were real, if all this magical stuff was possible, surely there was some way to save her, to bring
            her back‚Ä¶.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I started to understand Luke‚Äôs bitterness and how he seemed to resent his father,
            Hermes. So okay, maybe gods had important things to do. But couldn‚Äôt they call once in a while, or
            thunder, or something? Dionysus could make Diet Coke appear out of thin air. Why couldn‚Äôt my dad,
            whoever he was, make a phone appear?</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Thursday afternoon, three days after I‚Äôd arrived at Camp Half-Blood, I had my first
            sword-fighting lesson. Everybody from cabin eleven gathered in the big circular arena, where Luke
            would be our instructor.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We started with basic stabbing and slashing, using some straw-stuffed dummies in
            Greek armor. I guess I did okay. At least, I understood what I was supposed to do and my reflexes
            were good.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre17">The problem was, I couldn‚Äôt find a blade that felt right in
            my hands. Either they were too heavy, or too light, or too long. Luke tried his best to fix me up,
            but he agreed that none of the practice blades seemed to work for me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We moved on to dueling in pairs. Luke announced he would be my partner, since this
            was my first time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood luck,‚Äù one of the campers told me. ‚ÄúLuke‚Äôs the best swordsman in the last
            three hundred years.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôll go easy on me,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The camper snorted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke showed me thrusts and parries and shield blocks the hard way. With every
            swipe, I got a little more battered and bruised. ‚ÄúKeep your guard up, Percy,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, then whap me
            in the ribs with the flat of his blade. ‚ÄúNo, not that far up!‚Äù <i class="calibre7">Whap!</i>
            ‚ÄúLunge!‚Äù <i class="calibre7">Whap!</i> ‚ÄúNow, back!‚Äù <i class="calibre7">Whap!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">By the time he called a break, I was soaked in sweat. Everybody swarmed the drinks
            cooler. Luke poured ice water on his head, which looked like such a good idea, I did the same.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Instantly, I felt better. Strength surged back into my arms. The sword didn‚Äôt feel
            so awkward.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay, everybody circle up!‚Äù Luke ordered. ‚ÄúIf Percy doesn‚Äôt mind, I want to give
            you a little demo.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Great, I thought. Let‚Äôs all watch Percy get pounded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Hermes guys gathered around. They were suppressing smiles. I figured they‚Äôd
            been in my shoes before and couldn‚Äôt wait to see how Luke used me for a punching bag. He told
            everybody he was going to demonstrate a disarming technique: how to twist the enemy‚Äôs blade with the
            flat of your own sword so that he had no choice but to drop his weapon.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis is difficult,‚Äù he stressed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had it used against me. No laughing at
            Percy, now. Most swordsmen have to work years to master this technique.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He demonstrated the move on me in slow motion. Sure enough, the sword clattered out
            of my hand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNow in real time,‚Äù he said, after I‚Äôd retrieved my weapon. ‚ÄúWe keep sparring until
            one of us pulls it off. Ready, Percy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I nodded, and Luke came after me. Somehow, I kept him from getting a shot at the
            hilt of my sword. My senses opened up. I saw his attacks coming. I countered. I stepped forward and
            tried a thrust of my own. Luke deflected it easily, but I saw a change in his face. His eyes
            narrowed, and he started to press me with more force.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre17">The sword grew heavy in my hand. The balance wasn‚Äôt right. I
            knew it was only a matter of seconds before Luke took me down, so I figured, What the heck?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried the disarming maneuver.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My blade hit the base of Luke‚Äôs and I twisted, putting my whole weight into a
            downward thrust.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Clang.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke‚Äôs sword rattled against the stones. The tip of my blade was an inch from his
            undefended chest.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The other campers were silent.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I lowered my sword. ‚ÄúUm, sorry.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For a moment, Luke was too stunned to speak.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù His scarred face broke into a grin. ‚ÄúBy the gods, Percy, why are you
            sorry? Show me that again!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt want to. The short burst of manic energy had completely abandoned me. But
            Luke insisted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">This time, there was no contest. The moment our swords connected, Luke hit my hilt
            and sent my weapon skidding across the floor.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After a long pause, somebody in the audience said, ‚ÄúBeginner‚Äôs luck?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke wiped the sweat off his brow. He appraised me with an entirely new interest.
            ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I wonder what Percy could do with a balanced sword‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Friday afternoon, I was sitting with Grover at the lake, resting from a near-death
            experience on the climbing wall. Grover had scampered to the top like a mountain goat, but the lava
            had almost gotten me. My shirt had smoking holes in it. The hairs had been singed off my forearms.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">We sat on the pier, watching the naiads do underwater basket-weaving, until I got
            up the nerve to ask Grover how his conversation had gone with Mr. D.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His face turned a sickly shade of yellow.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust great.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo your career‚Äôs still on track?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He glanced at me nervously. ‚ÄúChiron t-told you I want a searcher‚Äôs license?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no.‚Äù I had no idea what a searcher‚Äôs license was, but it didn‚Äôt seem like the
            right time to ask. ‚ÄúHe just said you had big plans, you know‚Ä¶ and that you needed credit for
            completing a keeper‚Äôs assignment. So did you get it?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre17">Grover looked down at the naiads. ‚ÄúMr. D suspended judgment.
            He said I hadn‚Äôt failed or succeeded with you yet, so our fates were still tied together. If you got
            a quest and I went along to protect you, and we both came back alive, then maybe he‚Äôd consider the
            job complete.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My spirits lifted. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs not so bad, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">Blaa-ha-ha!</i> He might as well have transferred me to
            stable-cleaning duty. The chances of you getting a quest‚Ä¶and even if you did, why would you want <i
              class="calibre7">me</i> along?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôd want you along!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover stared glumly into the water. ‚ÄúBasket-weaving‚Ä¶Must be nice to have a useful
            skill.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to reassure him that he had lots of talents, but that just made him look
            more miserable. We talked about canoeing and swordplay for a while, then debated the pros and cons
            of the different gods. Finally, I asked him about the four empty cabins.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNumber eight, the silver one, belongs to Artemis,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe vowed to be a
            maiden forever. So of course, no kids. The cabin is, you know, honorary. If she didn‚Äôt have one,
            she‚Äôd be mad.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah, okay. But the other three, the ones at the end. Are those the Big Three?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover tensed. We were getting close to a touchy subject. ‚ÄúNo. One of them, number
            two, is Hera‚Äôs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another honorary thing. She‚Äôs the goddess of marriage, so of
            course she wouldn‚Äôt go around having affairs with mortals. That‚Äôs her husband‚Äôs job. When we say the
            Big Three, we mean the three powerful brothers, the sons of Kronos.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúZeus, Poseidon, Hades.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRight. You know. After the great battle with the Titans, they took over the world
            from their dad and drew lots to decide who got what.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúZeus got the sky,‚Äù I remembered. ‚ÄúPoseidon the sea, Hades the Underworld.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut Hades doesn‚Äôt have a cabin here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo. He doesn‚Äôt have a throne on Olympus, either. He sort of does his own thing
            down in the Underworld. If he did have a cabin here‚Ä¶‚Äù Grover shuddered. ‚ÄúWell, it wouldn‚Äôt be
            pleasant. Let‚Äôs leave it at that.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-135" class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut Zeus and Poseidon&mdash;they both had, like, a bazillion
            kids in the myths. Why are their cabins empty?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shifted his hooves uncomfortably. ‚ÄúAbout sixty years ago, after World War
            II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn‚Äôt sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful.
            They were affecting the course of human events too much, causing too much carnage. World War II, you
            know, that was basically a fight between the sons of Zeus and Poseidon on one side, and the sons of
            Hades on the other. The winning side, Zeus and Poseidon, made Hades swear an oath with them: no more
            affairs with mortal women. They all swore on the River Styx.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Thunder boomed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the most serious oath you can make.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover nodded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd the brothers kept their word&mdash;no kids?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover‚Äôs face darkened. ‚ÄúSeventeen years ago, Zeus fell off the wagon. There was
            this TV starlet with a big fluffy eighties hairdo&mdash;he just couldn‚Äôt help himself. When their
            child was born, a little girl named Thalia‚Ä¶well, the River Styx is serious about promises. Zeus
            himself got off easy because he‚Äôs immortal, but he brought a terrible fate on his daughter.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut that isn‚Äôt fair! It wasn‚Äôt the little girl‚Äôs fault.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover hesitated. ‚ÄúPercy, children of the Big Three have powers greater than other
            half-bloods. They have a strong aura, a scent that attracts monsters. When Hades found out about the
            girl, he wasn‚Äôt too happy about Zeus breaking his oath. Hades let the worst monsters out of Tartarus
            to torment Thalia. A satyr was assigned to be her keeper when she was twelve, but there was nothing
            he could do. He tried to escort her here with a couple of other half-bloods she‚Äôd befriended. They
            almost made it. They got all the way to the top of that hill.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He pointed across the valley, to the pine tree where I‚Äôd fought the minotaur. ‚ÄúAll
            three Kindly Ones were after them, along with a horde of hellhounds. They were about to be overrun
            when Thalia told her satyr to take the other two half-bloods to safety while she held off the
            monsters. She was wounded and tired, and she didn‚Äôt want to live like a hunted animal. The satyr
            didn‚Äôt want to leave her, but he couldn‚Äôt change her mind, and he had to protect the others. So
            Thalia made her final stand alone, at the top of that hill. As she died, Zeus took pity on her. He
            turned her into that pine tree. Her spirit still helps protect the borders of the valley. That‚Äôs why
            the hill is called Half-Blood Hill.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-136" class="calibre17">I stared at the pine in the distance.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The story made me feel hollow, and guilty too. A girl my age had sacrificed herself
            to save her friends. She had faced a whole army of monsters. Next to that, my victory over the
            Minotaur didn‚Äôt seem like much. I wondered, if I‚Äôd acted differently, could I have saved my mother?
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúhave heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOrpheus. Hercules. Houdini.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd have they ever returned somebody from the dead?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo. Never. Orpheus came close‚Ä¶.Percy, you‚Äôre not seriously thinking &mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI was just wondering. So‚Ä¶a satyr is always assigned to guard a
            demigod?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover studied me warily. I hadn‚Äôt persuaded him that I‚Äôd really dropped the
            Underworld idea. ‚ÄúNot always. We go undercover to a lot of schools. We try to sniff out the
            half-bloods who have the makings of great heroes. If we find one with a very strong aura, like a
            child of the Big Three, we alert Chiron. He tries to keep an eye on them, since they could cause
            really huge problems.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd you found me. Chiron said you thought I might be something special.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover looked as if I‚Äôd just led him into a trap. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶Oh, listen, don‚Äôt think
            like that. If you <i class="calibre7">were</i>&mdash;you know&mdash;you‚Äôd never <i class="calibre7">ever</i>
            be allowed a quest, and I‚Äôd never get my license. You‚Äôre probably a
            child of Hermes. Or maybe even one of the minor gods, like Nemesis, the god of revenge. Don‚Äôt worry,
            okay?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got the idea he was reassuring himself more than me.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">That night after dinner, there was a lot more excitement than usual.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">At last, it was time for capture the flag.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When the plates were cleared away, the conch horn sounded and we all stood at our
            tables.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-138" class="calibre17">Campers yelled and cheered as Annabeth and two of her
            siblings ran into the pavilion carrying a silk banner. It was about ten feet long, glistening gray,
            with a painting of a barn owl above an olive tree. From the opposite side of the pavilion, Clarisse
            and her buddies ran in with another banner, of identical size, but gaudy red, painted with a bloody
            spear and a boar‚Äôs head.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre17">I turned to Luke and yelled over the noise, ‚ÄúThose are the
            flags?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAres and Athena always lead the teams?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot always,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut often.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo, if another cabin captures one, what do you do&mdash;repaint the flag?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He grinned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see. First we have to get one.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhose side are we on?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He gave me a sly look, as if he knew something I didn‚Äôt. The scar on his face made
            him look almost evil in the torchlight. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made a temporary alliance with Athena. Tonight, we
            get the flag from Ares. And <i class="calibre7">you</i> are going to help.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The teams were announced. Athena had made an alliance with Apollo and Hermes, the
            two biggest cabins. Apparently, privileges had been traded &mdash;shower times, chore schedules, the
            best slots for activities&mdash;in order to win support.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares had allied themselves with everybody else: Dionysus, Demeter, Aphrodite, and
            Hephaestus. From what I‚Äôd seen, Dionysus‚Äôs kids were actually good athletes, but there were only two
            of them. Demeter‚Äôs kids had the edge with nature skills and outdoor stuff, but they weren‚Äôt very
            aggressive. Aphrodite‚Äôs sons and daughters I wasn‚Äôt too worried about. They mostly sat out every
            activity and checked their reflections in the lake and did their hair and gossiped. Hephaestus‚Äôs
            kids weren‚Äôt pretty, and there were only four of them, but they were big and burly from working in
            the metal shop all day. They might be a problem. That, of course, left Ares‚Äôs cabin: a dozen of the
            biggest, ugliest, meanest kids on Long Island, or anywhere else on the planet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron hammered his hoof on the marble.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHeroes!‚Äù he announced. ‚ÄúYou know the rules. The creek is the boundary line. The
            entire forest is fair game. All magic items are allowed. The banner must be prominently displayed,
            and have no more than two guards. Prisoners may be disarmed, but may not be bound or gagged. No
            killing or maiming is allowed. I will serve as referee and battlefield medic. Arm yourselves!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He spread his hands, and the tables were suddenly covered with equipment: helmets,
            bronze swords, spears, oxhide shields coated in metal.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really supposed to use these?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-141" class="calibre17">Luke looked at me as if I were crazy. ‚ÄúUnless you want to get
            skewered by your friends in cabin five. Here&mdash;Chiron thought these would fit. You‚Äôll be on
            border patrol.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My shield was the size of an NBA backboard, with a big caduceus in the middle. It
            weighed about a million pounds. I could have snowboarded on it fine, but I hoped nobody seriously
            expected me to run fast. My helmet, like all the helmets on Athena‚Äôs side, had a blue horsehair
            plume on top. Ares and their allies had red plumes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth yelled, ‚ÄúBlue team, forward!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We cheered and shook our swords and followed her down the path to the south woods.
            The red team yelled taunts at us as they headed off toward the north.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I managed to catch up with Annabeth without tripping over my equipment. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She kept marching.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúGot any magic items you can loan me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her hand drifted toward her pocket, as if she were afraid I‚Äôd stolen something.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúJust watch Clarisse‚Äôs spear,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want that thing touching you.
            Otherwise, don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôll take the banner from Ares. Has Luke given you your job?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBorder patrol, whatever that means.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy. Stand by the creek, keep the reds away. Leave the rest to me. Athena
            always has a plan.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She pushed ahead, leaving me in the dust.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúGlad you wanted me on your team.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was a warm, sticky night. The woods were dark, with fireflies popping in and out
            of view. Annabeth stationed me next to a little creek that gurgled over some rocks, then she and the
            rest of the team scattered into the trees.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Standing there alone, with my big blue-</p>
          <p class="calibre1">feathered helmet and my huge shield, I felt like an idiot. The bronze sword, like
            all the swords I‚Äôd tried so far, seemed balanced wrong. The leather grip pulled on my hands like a
            bowling ball.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was no way anybody would actually attack me, would they? I mean, Olympus had
            to have liability issues, right?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Far away, the conch horn blew. I heard whoops and yells in the woods, the clanking
            of metal, kids fighting. A blue-plumed ally from Apollo raced past me like a deer, leaped through
            the creek, and disappeared into enemy territory.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-142" class="calibre17">Great, I thought. I‚Äôll miss all the fun, as usual.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I heard a sound that sent a chill up my spine, a low canine growl, somewhere
            close by.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I raised my shield instinctively; I had the feeling something was stalking me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then the growling stopped. I felt the presence retreating.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">On the other side of the creek, the underbrush exploded. Five Ares warriors came
            yelling and screaming out of the dark.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCream the punk!‚Äù Clarisse screamed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her ugly pig eyes glared through the slits of her helmet. She brandished a
            five-foot-long spear, its barbed metal tip flickering with red light. Her siblings had only the
            standard-issue bronze swords&mdash;not that that made me feel any better.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They charged across the stream. There was no help in sight. I could run. Or I could
            defend myself against half the Ares cabin.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I managed to sidestep the first kid‚Äôs swing, but these guys were not as stupid as
            the Minotaur. They surrounded me, and Clarisse thrust at me with her spear. My shield deflected the
            point, but I felt a painful tingling all over my body. My hair stood on end. My shield arm went numb
            and the air burned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Electricity. Her stupid spear was electric. I fell back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Another Ares guy slammed me in the chest with the butt of his sword and I hit the
            dirt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They could‚Äôve kicked me into jelly, but they were too busy laughing.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-144" class="calibre17">‚ÄúGive him a haircut,‚Äù Clarisse said. ‚ÄúGrab his hair.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I managed to get to my feet. I raised my sword, but Clarisse slammed it aside with
            her spear as sparks flew. Now both my arms felt numb.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, wow,‚Äù Clarisse said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared of this guy. Really scared.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe flag is that way,‚Äù I told her. I wanted to sound angry, but I was afraid it
            didn‚Äôt come out that way.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù one of her siblings said. ‚ÄúBut see, we don‚Äôt care about the flag. We care
            about a guy who made our cabin look stupid.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou do that without my help,‚Äù I told them. It probably wasn‚Äôt the smartest thing
            to say.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Two of them came at me. I backed up toward the creek, tried to raise my shield, but
            Clarisse was too fast. Her spear stuck me straight in the ribs. If I hadn‚Äôt been wearing an armored
            breastplate, I would‚Äôve been shish-ke-babbed. As it was, the electric point just about shocked my
            teeth out of my mouth. One of her cabinmates slashed his sword across my arm, leaving a good-size
            cut.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Seeing my own blood made me dizzy&mdash;warm and cold at the same time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo maiming,‚Äù I managed to say.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOops,‚Äù the guy said. ‚ÄúGuess I lost my dessert privilege.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He pushed me into the creek and I landed with a splash. They all laughed. I figured
            as soon as they were through being amused, I would die. But then something happened. The water
            seemed to wake up my senses, as if I‚Äôd just had a bag of my mom‚Äôs double-espresso jelly beans.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Clarisse and her cabinmates came into the creek to get me, but I stood to meet
            them. I knew what to do. I swung the flat of my sword against the first guy‚Äôs head and knocked his
            helmet clean off. I hit him so hard I could see his eyes vibrating as he crumpled into the water.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ugly Number Two and Ugly Number Three came at me. I slammed one in the face with my
            shield and used my sword to shear off the other guy‚Äôs horsehair plume. Both of them backed up quick.
            Ugly Number Four didn‚Äôt look really anxious to attack, but Clarisse kept coming, the point of her
            spear crackling with energy. As soon as she thrust, I caught the shaft between the edge of my shield
            and my sword, and I snapped it like a twig.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh!‚Äù she screamed. ‚ÄúYou idiot! You corpse-breath worm!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She probably would‚Äôve said worse, but I smacked her between the eyes with my
            sword-butt and sent her stumbling backward out of the creek.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-145" class="calibre17">Then I heard yelling, elated screams, and I saw Luke racing
            toward the boundary line with the red team‚Äôs banner lifted high. He was flanked by a couple of
            Hermes guys covering his retreat, and a few Apollos behind them, fighting off the Hephaestus kids.
            The Ares folks got up, and Clarisse muttered a dazed curse.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA trick!‚Äù she shouted. ‚ÄúIt was a trick.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They staggered after Luke, but it was too late. Everybody converged on the creek as
            Luke ran across into friendly territory. Our side exploded into cheers. The red banner shimmered and
            turned to silver. The boar and spear were replaced with a huge caduceus, the symbol of cabin eleven.
            Everybody on the blue team picked up Luke and started carrying him around on their shoulders. Chiron
            cantered out from the woods and blew the conch horn.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The game was over. We‚Äôd won.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was about to join the celebration when Annabeth‚Äôs voice, right next to me in the
            creek, said, ‚ÄúNot bad, hero.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked, but she wasn‚Äôt there.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhere the heck did you learn to fight like that?‚Äù she asked. The air shimmered,
            and she materialized, holding a Yankees baseball cap as if she‚Äôd just taken it off her head.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I felt myself getting angry. I wasn‚Äôt even fazed by the fact that she‚Äôd just been
            invisible. ‚ÄúYou set me up,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou put me here because you knew Clarisse would come after me,
            while you sent Luke around the flank. You had it all figured out.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth shrugged. ‚ÄúI told you. Athena always, always has a plan.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA plan to get me pulverized.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI came as fast as I could. I was about to jump in, but‚Ä¶‚Äù She shrugged. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt
            need help.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then she noticed my wounded arm. ‚ÄúHow did you do that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSword cut,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo. It <i class="calibre7">was</i> a sword cut. Look at it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The blood was gone. Where the huge cut had been, there was a long white scratch,
            and even that was fading. As I watched, it turned into a small scar, and disappeared.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI&mdash;I don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth was thinking hard. I could almost see the gears turning. She looked down
            at my feet, then at Clarisse‚Äôs broken spear, and said, ‚ÄúStep out of the water, Percy.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúJust do it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I came out of the creek and immediately felt bone tired. My arms started to go numb
            again. My adrenaline rush left me. I almost fell over, but Annabeth steadied me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, Styx,‚Äù she cursed. ‚ÄúThis is <i class="calibre7">not</i> good. I didn‚Äôt want‚Ä¶I
            assumed it would be Zeus‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before I could ask what she meant, I heard that canine growl again, but much closer
            than before. A howl ripped through the forest.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The campers‚Äô cheering died instantly. Chiron shouted something in ancient Greek,
            which I would realize, only later, I had understood perfectly: <i class="calibre7">‚ÄúStand ready! My
              bow!‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth drew her sword.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There on the rocks just above us was a black hound the size of a rhino, with
            lava-red eyes and fangs like daggers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was looking straight at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Nobody moved except Annabeth, who yelled, ‚ÄúPercy, run!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She tried to step in front of me, but the hound was too fast. It leaped over
            her&mdash;an enormous shadow with teeth&mdash;and just as it hit me, as I stumbled backward and felt
            its razor-sharp claws ripping through my armor, there was a cascade of thwacking sounds, like forty
            pieces of paper being ripped one after the other. From the hound‚Äôs neck sprouted a cluster of
            arrows. The monster fell dead at my feet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">By some miracle, I was still alive. I didn‚Äôt want to look underneath the ruins of
            my shredded armor. My chest felt warm and wet, and I knew I was badly cut. Another second, and the
            monster would‚Äôve turned me into a hundred pounds of delicatessen meat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron trotted up next to us, a bow in his hand, his face grim.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúDi immortales!‚Äù</i> Annabeth said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a hellhound from
            the Fields of Punishment. They don‚Äôt‚Ä¶they‚Äôre not supposed to‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomeone summoned it,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúSomeone inside the camp.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke came over, the banner in his hand forgotten, his moment of glory gone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Clarisse yelled, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all Percy‚Äôs fault! Percy summoned it!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBe quiet, child,‚Äù Chiron told her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We watched the body of the hellhound melt into shadow, soaking into the ground
            until it disappeared.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wounded,‚Äù Annabeth told me. ‚ÄúQuick, Percy, get in the
            water.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúChiron, watch this.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was too tired to argue. I stepped back into the creek, the whole camp gathering
            around me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Instantly, I felt better. I could feel the cuts on my chest closing up. Some of the
            campers gasped.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLook, I&mdash;I don‚Äôt know why,‚Äù I said, trying to apologize. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But they weren‚Äôt watching my wounds heal. They were staring at something above my
            head.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Annabeth said, pointing. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">By the time I looked up, the sign was already fading, but I could still make out
            the hologram of green light, spinning and gleaming. A three-tipped spear: a trident.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour father,‚Äù Annabeth murmured. ‚ÄúThis is <i
              class="calibre7">really</i> not good.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt is determined,‚Äù Chiron announced.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All around me, campers started kneeling, even the Ares cabin, though they didn‚Äôt
            look happy about it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy father?‚Äù I asked, completely bewildered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPoseidon,‚Äù said Chiron. ‚ÄúEarthshaker, Stormbringer, Father of Horses. Hail,
            Perseus Jackson, Son of the Sea God.‚Äù</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 9: I AM OFFERED A QUEST</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">T</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">HE NEXT
              MORNING</span>, C<span class="calibre5">HIRON MOVED</span> me to cabin three. I didn‚Äôt have to
            share with anybody. I had plenty of room for all my stuff: the Minotaur‚Äôs horn, one set of spare
            clothes, and a toiletry bag. I got to sit at my own dinner table, pick all my own activities, call
            ‚Äúlights out‚Äù whenever I felt like it, and not listen to anybody else.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">And I was absolutely miserable.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Just when I‚Äôd started to feel accepted, to feel I had a home in cabin eleven and I
            might be a normal kid&mdash;or as normal as you can be when you‚Äôre a half-blood&mdash;I‚Äôd been
            separated out as if I had some rare disease.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Nobody mentioned the hellhound, but I got the feeling they were all talking about
            it behind my back. The attack had scared everybody. It sent two messages: one, that I was the son of
            the Sea God; and two, monsters would stop at nothing to kill me. They could even invade a camp that
            had always been considered safe.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-150" class="calibre17">The other campers steered clear of me as much as possible.
            Cabin eleven was too nervous to have sword class with me after what I‚Äôd done to the Ares folks in
            the woods, so my lessons with Luke became one-on-one. He pushed me harder than ever, and wasn‚Äôt
            afraid to bruise me up in the process.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to need all the training you can get,‚Äù he promised, as we were
            working with swords and flaming torches. ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs try that viper-beheading strike again. Fifty
            more repetitions.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth still taught me Greek in the mornings, but she seemed distracted. Every
            time I said something, she scowled at me, as if I‚Äôd just poked her between the eyes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After lessons, she would walk away muttering to herself: ‚ÄúQuest‚Ä¶ Poseidon?‚Ä¶Dirty
            rotten‚Ä¶Got to make a plan‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Even Clarisse kept her distance, though her venomous looks made it clear she wanted
            to kill me for breaking her magic spear. I wished she would just yell or punch me or something. I‚Äôd
            rather get into fights every day than be ignored.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">I knew somebody at camp resented me, because one night I came into my cabin and
            found a mortal newspaper dropped inside the doorway, a copy of the <i class="calibre7">New York
              Daily News</i>, opened to the Metro page. The article took me almost an hour to read, because
            the angrier I got, the more the words floated around on the page.</p>

          <p class="calibre6">Sally Jackson and son Percy are still missing one week after their</p>
          <p class="calibre6">mysterious disappearance. The family‚Äôs badly burned ‚Äô78 Camaro was</p>
          <p class="calibre6">discovered last Saturday on a north Long Island road with the roof</p>
          <p class="calibre6">ripped off and the front axle broken. The car had flipped and skidded</p>
          <p class="calibre6">for several hundred feet before exploding.</p>
          <p class="calibre3">Mother and son had gone for a weekend vacation to Montauk, but</p>
          <p class="calibre6">left hastily, under mysterious circumstances. Small traces of blood</p>
          <p class="calibre6">were found in the car and near the scene of the wreck, but there were</p>
          <p class="calibre6">no other signs of the missing Jacksons. Residents in the rural area</p>
          <p class="calibre6">reported seeing nothing unusual around the time of the accident.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-151" class="calibre3">Ms. Jackson‚Äôs husband, Gabe Ugliano, claims that his stepson,
          </p>
          <p class="calibre6">Percy Jackson, is a troubled child who has been kicked out of</p>
          <p class="calibre6">numerous boarding schools and has expressed violent tendencies in the</p>
          <p class="calibre6">past.</p>
          <p class="calibre51">Police would not say whether son Percy is a suspect in his mother‚Äôs</p>
          <p class="calibre6">disappearance, but they have not ruled out foul play. Below are recent</p>
          <p class="calibre6">pictures of Sally Jackson and Percy. Police urge anyone with</p>
          <p class="calibre6">information to call the following toll-free crime-stoppers hotline.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre17">The phone number was circled in black marker.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wadded up the paper and threw it away, then flopped down in my bunk bed in the
            middle of my empty cabin.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLights out,‚Äù I told myself miserably.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">That night, I had my worst dream yet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was running along the beach in a storm. This time, there was a city behind me.
            Not New York. The sprawl was different: buildings spread farther apart, palm trees and low hills in
            the distance.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">About a hundred yards down the surf, two men were fighting. They looked like TV
            wrestlers, muscular, with beards and long hair. Both wore flowing Greek tunics, one trimmed in blue,
            the other in green. They grappled with each other, wrestled, kicked and head-butted, and every time
            they connected, lightning flashed, the sky grew darker, and the wind rose.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-152" class="calibre17">I had to stop them. I didn‚Äôt know why. But the harder I ran,
            the more the wind blew me back, until I was running in place, my heels digging uselessly in the
            sand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Over the roar of the storm, I could hear the blue-robed one yelling at the
            green-robed one, <i class="calibre7">Give it back! Give it back!</i> Like a kindergartner fighting
            over a toy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The waves got bigger, crashing into the beach, spraying me with salt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I yelled, <i class="calibre7">Stop it! Stop fighting!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The ground shook. Laughter came from somewhere under the earth, and a voice so deep
            and evil it turned my blood to ice.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Come down, little hero,</i> the voice crooned. <i
              class="calibre7">Come down!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The sand split beneath me, opening up a crevice straight down to the center of the
            earth. My feet slipped, and darkness swallowed me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I woke up, sure I was falling.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was still in bed in cabin three. My body told me it was morning, but it was dark
            outside, and thunder rolled across the hills. A storm was brewing. I hadn‚Äôt dreamed that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I heard a clopping sound at the door, a hoof knocking on the threshold.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome in?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover trotted inside, looking worried. ‚ÄúMr. D wants to see you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe wants to kill‚Ä¶I mean, I‚Äôd better let him tell you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Nervously, I got dressed and followed, sure that I was in huge trouble.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For days, I‚Äôd been half expecting a summons to the Big House. Now that I was
            declared a son of Poseidon, one of the Big Three gods who weren‚Äôt supposed to have kids, I figured
            it was a crime for me just to be alive. The other gods had probably been debating the best way to
            punish me for existing, and now Mr. D was ready to deliver their verdict.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Over Long Island Sound, the sky looked like ink soup coming to a boil. A hazy
            curtain of rain was coming in our direction. I asked Grover if we needed an umbrella.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt never rains here unless we want it to.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I pointed at the storm. ‚ÄúWhat the heck is that, then?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He glanced uneasily at the sky. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll pass around us. Bad weather always does.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I realized he was right. In the week I‚Äôd been here, it had never even been
            overcast. The few rain clouds I‚Äôd seen had skirted right around the edges of the valley.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre17">But this storm‚Ä¶this one was huge.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">At the volleyball pit, the kids from Apollo‚Äôs cabin were playing a morning game
            against the satyrs. Dionysus‚Äôs twins were walking around in the strawberry fields, making the plants
            grow. Everybody was going about their normal business, but they looked tense. They kept their eyes
            on the storm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and I walked up to the front porch of the Big House. Dionysus sat at the
            pinochle table in his tiger-striped Hawaiian shirt with his Diet Coke, just as he had on my first
            day. Chiron sat across the table in his fake wheelchair. They were playing against invisible
            opponents&mdash;two sets of cards hovering in the air.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù Mr. D said without looking up. ‚ÄúOur little celebrity.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I waited.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome closer,‚Äù Mr. D said. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt expect me to kowtow to you, mortal, just
            because old Barnacle-Beard is your father.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A net of lightning flashed across the clouds. Thunder shook the windows of the
            house.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBlah, blah, blah,‚Äù Dionysus said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron feigned interest in his pinochle cards. Grover cowered by the railing, his
            hooves clopping back and forth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf I had my way,‚Äù Dionysus said, ‚ÄúI would cause your molecules to erupt in flames.
            We‚Äôd sweep up the ashes and be done with a lot of trouble. But Chiron seems to feel this would be
            against my mission at this cursed camp: to keep you little brats safe from harm.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSpontaneous combustion <i class="calibre7">is</i> a form of harm, Mr. D,‚Äù Chiron
            put in.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNonsense,‚Äù Dionysus said. ‚ÄúBoy wouldn‚Äôt feel a thing. Nevertheless, I‚Äôve agreed to
            restrain myself. I‚Äôm thinking of turning you into a dolphin instead, sending you back to your
            father.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMr. D&mdash;‚Äù Chiron warned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, all right,‚Äù Dionysus relented. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one more option. But it‚Äôs deadly
            foolishness.‚Äù Dionysus rose, and the invisible players‚Äô cards dropped to the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off to
            Olympus for the emergency meeting. If the boy is still here when I get back, I‚Äôll turn him into an
            Atlantic bottlenose. Do you understand? And Perseus Jackson, if you‚Äôre at all smart, you‚Äôll see
            that‚Äôs a much more sensible choice than what Chiron feels you must do.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-154" class="calibre17">Dionysus picked up a playing card, twisted it, and it became
            a plastic rectangle. A credit card? No. A security pass.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He snapped his fingers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The air seemed to fold and bend around him. He became a hologram, then a wind, then
            he was gone, leaving only the smell of fresh-pressed grapes lingering behind.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron smiled at me, but he looked tired and strained. ‚ÄúSit, Percy, please. And
            Grover.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We did.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron laid his cards on the table, a winning hand he hadn‚Äôt gotten to use.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTell me, Percy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat did you make of the hellhound?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Just hearing the name made me shudder.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron probably wanted me to say, <i class="calibre7">Heck, it was nothing. I eat
              hellhounds for breakfast.</i> But I didn‚Äôt feel like lying.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt scared me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you hadn‚Äôt shot it, I‚Äôd be dead.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôll meet worse, Percy. Far worse, before you‚Äôre done.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDone‚Ä¶with what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour quest, of course. Will you accept it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I glanced at Grover, who was crossing his fingers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm, sir,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt told me what it is yet.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron grimaced. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the hard part, the details.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Thunder rumbled across the valley. The storm clouds had now reached the edge of the
            beach. As far as I could see, the sky and sea were boiling together.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPoseidon and Zeus,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fighting over something valuable‚Ä¶something
            that was stolen, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron and Grover exchanged looks.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron sat forward in his wheelchair. ‚ÄúHow did you know that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My face felt hot. I wished I hadn‚Äôt opened my big mouth. ‚ÄúThe weather since
            Christmas has been weird, like the sea and the sky are fighting. Then I talked to Annabeth, and
            she‚Äôd overheard something about a theft. And‚Ä¶I‚Äôve also been having these dreams.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù Grover said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHush, satyr,‚Äù Chiron ordered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut it is his quest!‚Äù Grover‚Äôs eyes were bright with excitement. ‚ÄúIt must be!‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-155" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOnly the Oracle can determine.‚Äù Chiron stroked his bristly
            beard. ‚ÄúNevertheless, Percy, you are correct. Your father and Zeus are having their worst quarrel in
            centuries. They are fighting over something valuable that was stolen. To be precise: a lightning
            bolt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I laughed nervously. ‚ÄúA <i class="calibre7">what</i>?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDo not take this lightly,‚Äù Chiron warned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about some
            tinfoil-covered zigzag you‚Äôd see in a second-grade play. I‚Äôm talking about a two-foot-long cylinder
            of high-grade celestial bronze, capped on both ends with god-level explosives.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúZeus‚Äôs master bolt,‚Äù Chiron said, getting worked up now. ‚ÄúThe symbol of his power,
            from which all other lightning bolts are patterned. The first weapon made by the Cyclopes for the
            war against the Titans, the bolt that sheared the top off Mount Etna and hurled Kronos from his
            throne; the master bolt, which packs enough power to make mortal hydrogen bombs look like
            firecrackers.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs missing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúStolen,‚Äù Chiron said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBy who?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBy <i class="calibre7">whom</i>,‚Äù Chiron corrected. Once a teacher, always a
            teacher. ‚ÄúBy you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mouth fell open.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-156" class="calibre17">‚ÄúAt least‚Äù&mdash;Chiron held up a hand&mdash;‚Äúthat‚Äôs what
            Zeus thinks. During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an
            argument. The usual nonsense: ‚ÄòMother Rhea always liked you best,‚Äô ‚ÄòAir disasters are more
            spectacular than sea disasters,‚Äô et cetera. Afterward, Zeus realized his master bolt was missing,
            taken from the throne room under his very nose. He immediately blamed Poseidon. Now, a god cannot
            usurp another god‚Äôs symbol of power directly&mdash;that is forbidden by the most ancient of divine
            laws. But Zeus believes your father convinced a human hero to take it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPatience and listen, child,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúZeus has good reason to be suspicious.
            The forges of the Cyclopes are under the ocean, which gives Poseidon some influence over the makers
            of his brother‚Äôs lightning. Zeus believes Poseidon has taken the master bolt, and is now secretly
            having the Cyclopes build an arsenal of illegal copies, which might be used to topple Zeus from his
            throne. The only thing Zeus wasn‚Äôt sure about was which hero Poseidon used to steal the bolt. Now
            Poseidon has openly claimed you as his son. You were in New York over the winter holidays. You could
            easily have snuck into Olympus. Zeus believes he has found his thief.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron and Grover glanced nervously at the sky. The clouds didn‚Äôt seem to be
            parting around us, as Grover had promised. They were rolling straight over our valley, sealing us in
            like a coffin lid.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúEr, Percy‚Ä¶?‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt use the <i class="calibre7">c</i>-word to
            describe the Lord of the Sky.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPerhaps <i class="calibre7">paranoid</i>,‚Äù Chiron suggested. ‚ÄúThen again, Poseidon
            has tried to unseat Zeus before. I believe that was question thirty-eight on your final exam‚Ä¶.‚Äù He
            looked at me as if he actually expected me to remember question thirty-eight.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">How could anyone accuse me of stealing a god‚Äôs weapon? I couldn‚Äôt even steal a
            slice of pizza from Gabe‚Äôs poker party without getting busted. Chiron was waiting for an answer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomething about a golden net?‚Äù I guessed. ‚ÄúPoseidon and Hera and a few other
            gods‚Ä¶they, like, trapped Zeus and wouldn‚Äôt let him out until he promised to be a better ruler,
            right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúAnd Zeus has never trusted Poseidon since. Of course,
            Poseidon denies stealing the master bolt. He took great offense at the accusation. The two have been
            arguing back and forth for months, threatening war. And now, you‚Äôve come along&mdash;the proverbial
            last straw.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm just a kid!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Grover cut in, ‚Äúif you were Zeus, and you already thought your brother was
            plotting to overthrow you, then your brother suddenly admitted he had broken the sacred oath he took
            after World War II, that he‚Äôs fathered a new mortal hero who might be used as a weapon against
            you‚Ä¶Wouldn‚Äôt that put a twist in your toga?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt do anything. Poseidon&mdash;my dad&mdash;he didn‚Äôt really have this
            master bolt stolen, did he?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron sighed. ‚ÄúMost thinking observers would agree that thievery is not Poseidon‚Äôs
            style. But the Sea God is too proud to try convincing Zeus of that. Zeus has demanded that Poseidon
            return the bolt by the summer solstice. That‚Äôs June twenty-first, ten days from now. Poseidon wants
            an apology for being called a thief by the same date. I hoped that diplomacy might prevail, that
            Hera or Demeter or Hestia would make the two brothers see sense. But your arrival has inflamed
            Zeus‚Äôs temper. Now neither god will back down. Unless someone intervenes, unless the master bolt is
            found and returned to Zeus before the solstice, there will be war. And do you know what a
            full-fledged war would look like, Percy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBad?‚Äù I guessed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúImagine the world in chaos. Nature at war with itself. Olympians forced to choose
            sides between Zeus and Poseidon. Destruction. Carnage. Millions dead. Western civilization turned
            into a battleground so big it will make the Trojan War look like a water-balloon fight.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBad,‚Äù I repeated.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd you, Percy Jackson, would be the first to feel Zeus‚Äôs wrath.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It started to rain. Volleyball players stopped their game and stared in stunned
            silence at the sky.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">I</i> had brought this storm to Half-Blood Hill. Zeus was
            punishing the whole camp because of me. I was furious.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo I have to find the stupid bolt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd return it to Zeus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat better peace offering,‚Äù Chiron said, ‚Äúthan to have the son of Poseidon return
            Zeus‚Äôs property?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf Poseidon doesn‚Äôt have it, where is the thing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI believe I know.‚Äù Chiron‚Äôs expression was grim. ‚ÄúPart of a prophecy I had years
            ago‚Ä¶well, some of the lines make sense to me, now. But before I can say more, you must officially
            take up the quest. You must seek the counsel of the Oracle.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you tell me where the bolt is beforehand?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause if I did, you would be too afraid to accept the challenge.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I swallowed. ‚ÄúGood reason.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou agree then?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at Grover, who nodded encouragingly.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Easy for him. I was the one Zeus wanted to kill.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than being turned into a dolphin.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs time you consulted the Oracle,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúGo upstairs, Percy
            Jackson, to the attic. When you come back down, assuming you‚Äôre still sane, we will talk more.‚Äù</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Four flights up, the stairs ended under a green trap-door.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I pulled the cord. The door swung down, and a wooden ladder clattered into place.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">The warm air from above smelled like mildew and rotten wood and something else‚Ä¶a
            smell I remembered from biology class. Reptiles. The smell of snakes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I held my breath and climbed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The attic was filled with Greek hero junk: armor stands covered in cobwebs;
            once-bright shields pitted with rust; old leather steamer trunks plastered with stickers saying
            <span class="calibre5">ITHAKA, CIRCE‚ÄôS ISLE</span>, and <span class="calibre5">LAND OF THE</span>
            <span class="calibre5">AMAZONS</span> . One long table was stacked with glass jars filled with
            pickled <i class="calibre7">things</i>&mdash;severed hairy claws, huge yellow eyes, various other
            parts of monsters. A dusty mounted trophy on the wall looked like a giant snake‚Äôs head, but with
            horns and a full set of shark‚Äôs teeth. The plaque read, <span class="calibre5">HYDRA</span> <span
              class="calibre5">HEAD</span> #I, <span class="calibre5">WOODSTOCK, N.Y.</span>, 1969.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">By the window, sitting on a wooden tripod stool, was the most gruesome memento of
            all: a mummy. Not the wrapped-in-cloth kind, but a human female body shriveled to a husk. She wore a
            tie-dyed sundress, lots of beaded necklaces, and a headband over long black hair. The skin of her
            face was thin and leathery over her skull, and her eyes were glassy white slits, as if the real eyes
            had been replaced by marbles; she‚Äôd been dead a long, long time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Looking at her sent chills up my back. And that was before she sat up on her stool
            and opened her mouth. A green mist poured from the mummy‚Äôs mouth, coiling over the floor in thick
            tendrils, hissing like twenty thousand snakes. I stumbled over myself trying to get to the trapdoor,
            but it slammed shut. Inside my head, I heard a voice, slithering into one ear and coiling around my
            brain: <i class="calibre7">I am the spirit of Delphi, speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo,
              slayer of the mighty Python. Approach, seeker, and ask.</i></p>
          <p id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre17">I wanted to say, <i class="calibre7">No thanks, wrong door,
              just looking for the bathroom.</i> But I forced myself to take a deep breath.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The mummy wasn‚Äôt alive. She was some kind of gruesome receptacle for something
            else, the power that was now swirling around me in the green mist. But its presence didn‚Äôt feel
            evil, like my demonic math teacher Mrs. Dodds or the Minotaur. It felt more like the Three Fates I‚Äôd
            seen knitting the yarn outside the highway fruit stand: ancient, powerful, and definitely <i
              class="calibre7">not</i> human. But not particularly interested in killing me, either.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got up the courage to ask, ‚ÄúWhat is my destiny?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The mist swirled more thickly, collecting right in front of me and around the table
            with the pickled monster-part jars. Suddenly there were four men sitting around the table, playing
            cards. Their faces became clearer. It was Smelly Gabe and his buddies.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My fists clenched, though I knew this poker party couldn‚Äôt be real. It was an
            illusion, made out of mist.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe turned toward me and spoke in the rasping voice of the Oracle: <i
              class="calibre7">You shall go west, and face the god who has turned.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">His buddy on the right looked up and said in the same voice: <i class="calibre7">You
              shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The guy on the left threw in two poker chips, then said: <i class="calibre7">You
              shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, Eddie, our building super, delivered the worst line of all: <i
              class="calibre7">And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The figures began to dissolve. At first I was too stunned to say anything, but as
            the mist retreated, coiling into a huge green serpent and slithering back into the mouth of the
            mummy, I cried, ‚ÄúWait! What do you mean? What friend? What will I fail to save?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The tail of the mist snake disappeared into the mummy‚Äôs mouth. She reclined back
            against the wall. Her mouth closed tight, as if it hadn‚Äôt been open in a hundred years. The attic
            was silent again, abandoned, nothing but a room full of mementos.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre17">I got the feeling that I could stand here until I had
            cobwebs, too, and I wouldn‚Äôt learn anything else.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My audience with the Oracle was over.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Chiron asked me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I slumped into a chair at the pinochle table. ‚ÄúShe said I would retrieve what was
            stolen.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre17">Grover sat forward, chewing excitedly on the remains of a
            Diet Coke can. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat did the Oracle say <i class="calibre7">exactly</i>?‚Äù Chiron pressed. ‚ÄúThis is
            important.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My ears were still tingling from the reptilian voice. ‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶she said I would go west
            and face a god who had turned. I would retrieve what was stolen and see it safely returned.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù Grover said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron didn‚Äôt look satisfied. ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt want to tell him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">What friend would betray me? I didn‚Äôt have that many.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">And the last line&mdash;I would fail to save what mattered most. What kind of
            Oracle would send me on a quest and tell me, <i class="calibre7">Oh, by the way, you‚Äôll fail.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">How could I confess that?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He studied my face. ‚ÄúVery well, Percy. But know this: the Oracle‚Äôs words often have
            double meanings. Don‚Äôt dwell on them too much. The truth is not always clear until events come to
            pass.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got the feeling he knew I was holding back something bad, and he was trying to
            make me feel better.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, anxious to change topics. ‚ÄúSo where do I go? Who‚Äôs this god in the
            west?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh, think, Percy,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúIf Zeus and Poseidon weaken each other in a war,
            who stands to gain?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomebody else who wants to take over?‚Äù I guessed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, quite. Someone who harbors a grudge, who has been unhappy with his lot since
            the world was divided eons ago, whose kingdom would grow powerful with the deaths of millions.
            Someone who hates his brothers for forcing him into an oath to have no more children, an oath that
            both of them have now broken.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about my dreams, the evil voice that had spoken from the ground. ‚ÄúHades.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron nodded. ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Dead is the only possibility.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A scrap of aluminum dribbled out of Grover‚Äôs mouth. ‚ÄúWhoa, wait. Wh-what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA Fury came after Percy,‚Äù Chiron reminded him. ‚ÄúShe watched the young man until
            she was sure of his identity, then tried to kill him. Furies obey only one lord: Hades.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, but&mdash;but Hades hates <i class="calibre7">all</i>
            heroes,‚Äù Grover protested. ‚ÄúEspecially if he has found out Percy is a son of Poseidon‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA hellhound got into the forest,‚Äù Chiron continued. ‚ÄúThose can only be summoned
            from the Fields of Punishment, and it had to be summoned by someone within the camp. Hades must have
            a spy here. He must suspect Poseidon will try to use Percy to clear his name. Hades would very much
            like to kill this young half-blood before he can take on the quest.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs two major gods who want to kill me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut a quest to‚Ä¶‚Äù Grover swallowed. ‚ÄúI mean, couldn‚Äôt the master bolt be in some
            place like Maine? Maine‚Äôs very nice this time of year.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHades sent a minion to steal the master bolt,‚Äù Chiron insisted. ‚ÄúHe hid it in the
            Underworld, knowing full well that Zeus would blame Poseidon. I don‚Äôt pretend to understand the Lord
            of the Dead‚Äôs motives perfectly, or why he chose this time to start a war, but one thing is certain.
            Percy must go to the Underworld, find the master bolt, and reveal the truth.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A strange fire burned in my stomach. The weirdest thing was: it wasn‚Äôt fear. It was
            anticipation. The desire for revenge. Hades had tried to kill me three times so far, with the Fury,
            the Minotaur, and the hellhound. It was his fault my mother had disappeared in a flash of light. Now
            he was trying to frame me and my dad for a theft we hadn‚Äôt committed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was ready to take him on.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Besides, if my mother was in the Underworld‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Whoa, boy, said the small part of my brain that was still sane. You‚Äôre a kid. Hades
            is a god.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was trembling. He‚Äôd started eating pinochle cards like potato chips.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The poor guy needed to complete a quest with me so he could get his searcher‚Äôs
            license, whatever that was, but how could I ask him to do this quest, especially when the Oracle
            said I was destined to fail? This was suicide.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLook, if we know it‚Äôs Hades,‚Äù I told Chiron, ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt we just tell the other
            gods? Zeus or Poseidon could go down to the Underworld and bust some heads.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSuspecting and knowing are not the same,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúBesides, even if the other
            gods suspect Hades&mdash;and I imagine Poseidon does&mdash;they couldn‚Äôt retrieve the bolt
            themselves. Gods cannot cross each other‚Äôs territories except by invitation. That is another ancient
            rule. Heroes, on the other hand, have certain privileges. They can go anywhere, challenge anyone, as
            long as they‚Äôre bold enough and strong enough to do it. No god can be held responsible for a hero‚Äôs
            actions. Why do you think the gods always operate through humans?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm being used.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs no accident Poseidon has claimed you now. It‚Äôs a very risky
            gamble, but he‚Äôs in a desperate situation. He needs you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My dad needs me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Emotions rolled around inside me like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. I didn‚Äôt
            know whether to feel resentful or grateful or happy or angry. Poseidon had ignored me for twelve
            years. Now suddenly he needed me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at Chiron. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve known I was Poseidon‚Äôs son all along, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI had my suspicions. As I said‚Ä¶I‚Äôve spoken to the Oracle, too.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got the feeling there was a lot he wasn‚Äôt telling me about his prophecy, but I
            decided I couldn‚Äôt worry about that right now. After all, I was holding back information too.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo let me get this straight,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to go to the Underworld and
            confront the Lord of the Dead.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCheck,‚Äù Chiron said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFind the most powerful weapon in the universe.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCheck.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd get it back to Olympus before the summer solstice, in ten days.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about right.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at Grover, who gulped down the ace of hearts.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDid I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year?‚Äù he asked weakly.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt ask that of you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù He shifted his hooves. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just that satyrs and underground
            places‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He took a deep breath, then stood, brushing the shredded cards and aluminum bits
            off his T-shirt. ‚ÄúYou saved my life, Percy. If‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre serious about wanting me along, I won‚Äôt let
            you down.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I felt so relieved I wanted to cry, though I didn‚Äôt think that would be very
            heroic. Grover was the only friend I‚Äôd ever had for longer than a few months. I wasn‚Äôt sure what
            good a satyr could do against the forces of the dead, but I felt better knowing he‚Äôd be with me.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-165" class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll the way, G-man.‚Äù I turned to Chiron. ‚ÄúSo where do we go?
            The Oracle just said to go west.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe entrance to the Underworld is always in the west. It moves from age to age,
            just like Olympus. Right now, of course, it‚Äôs in America.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron looked surprised. ‚ÄúI thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance to
            the Underworld is in Los Angeles.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNaturally. So we just get on a plane&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Grover shrieked. ‚ÄúPercy, what are you thinking? Have you ever been on a plane
            in your life?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I shook my head, feeling embarrassed. My mom had never taken me anywhere by plane.
            She‚Äôd always said we didn‚Äôt have the money. Besides, her parents had died in a plane crash.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy, think,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúYou are the son of the Sea God. Your father‚Äôs
            bitterest rival is Zeus, Lord of the Sky. Your mother knew better than to trust you in an airplane.
            You would be in Zeus‚Äôs domain. You would never come down again alive.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Overhead, lightning crackled. Thunder boomed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, determined not to look at the storm. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôll travel overland.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúTwo companions may accompany you. Grover is one. The
            other has already volunteered, if you will accept her help.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGee,‚Äù I said, feigning surprise. ‚ÄúWho else would be stupid enough to volunteer for
            a quest like this?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The air shimmered behind Chiron.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth became visible, stuffing her Yankees cap into her back pocket.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting a long time for a quest, Seaweed Brain,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAthena is no
            fan of Poseidon, but if you‚Äôre going to save the world, I‚Äôm the best person to keep you from messing
            up.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf you do say so yourself,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI suppose you have a plan, Wise Girl?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her cheeks colored. ‚ÄúDo you want my help or not?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The truth was, I did. I needed all the help I could get.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA trio,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll work.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúThis afternoon, we can take you as far as the bus
            terminal in Manhattan. After that, you are on your own.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-166" class="calibre17">Lightning flashed. Rain poured down on the meadows that were
            never supposed to have violent weather.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo time to waste,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúI think you should all get packing.‚Äù</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 10: I RUIN A PERFECTLY GOOD BUS</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">I</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">T DIDN‚ÄôT TAKE ME
              LONG TO PACK.</span> I decided to leave the Minotaur horn in my cabin, which left me only an
            extra change of clothes and a toothbrush to stuff in a backpack Grover had found for me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The camp store loaned me one hundred dollars in mortal money and twenty golden
            drachmas. These coins were as big as Girl Scout cookies and had images of various Greek gods stamped
            on one side and the Empire State Building on the other. The ancient mortal drachmas had been silver,
            Chiron told us, but Olympians never used less than pure gold. Chiron said the coins might come in
            handy for non-mortal transactions&mdash;whatever that meant. He gave Annabeth and me each a canteen
            of nectar and a Ziploc bag full of ambrosia squares, to be used only in emergencies, if we were
            seriously hurt. It was god food, Chiron reminded us. It would cure us of almost any injury, but it
            was lethal to mortals. Too much of it would make a half-blood very, very feverish. An overdose would
            burn us up, literally.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth was bringing her magic Yankees cap, which she told me had been a
            twelfth-birthday present from her mom. She carried a book on famous classical architecture, written
            in Ancient Greek, to read when she got bored, and a long bronze knife, hidden in her shirt sleeve. I
            was sure the knife would get us busted the first time we went through a metal detector.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover wore his fake feet and his pants to pass as human. He wore a green
            rasta-style cap, because when it rained his curly hair flattened and you could just see the tips of
            his horns. His bright orange backpack was full of scrap metal and apples to snack on. In his pocket
            was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs:
            Mozart‚Äôs Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff‚Äôs ‚ÄúSo Yesterday,‚Äù both of which sounded pretty bad on
            reed pipes.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-168" class="calibre17">We waved good-bye to the other campers, took one last look at
            the strawberry fields, the ocean, and the Big House, then hiked up Half-Blood Hill to the tall pine
            tree that used to be Thalia, daughter of Zeus.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron was waiting for us in his wheelchair. Next to him stood the surfer dude I‚Äôd
            seen when I was recovering in the sick room. According to Grover, the guy was the camp‚Äôs head of
            security. He supposedly had eyes all over his body so he could never be surprised. Today, though, he
            was wearing a chauffeur‚Äôs uniform, so I could only see extra peepers on his hands, face and neck.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis is Argus,‚Äù Chiron told me. ‚ÄúHe will drive you into the city, and, er, well,
            keep an eye on things.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I heard footsteps behind us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke came running up the hill, carrying a pair of basketball shoes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù he panted. ‚ÄúGlad I caught you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth blushed, the way she always did when Luke was around.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúJust wanted to say good luck,‚Äù Luke told me. ‚ÄúAnd I thought‚Ä¶um, maybe you could
            use these.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He handed me the sneakers, which looked pretty normal. They even smelled kind of
            normal.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke said, <i class="calibre7">‚ÄúMaia!‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">White bird‚Äôs wings sprouted out of the heels, startling me so much, I dropped them.
            The shoes flapped around on the ground until the wings folded up and disappeared.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAwesome!‚Äù Grover said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke smiled. ‚ÄúThose served me well when I was on my quest. Gift from Dad. Of
            course, I don‚Äôt use them much these days‚Ä¶.‚Äù His expression turned sad.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt know what to say. It was cool enough that Luke had come to say good-bye.
            I‚Äôd been afraid he might resent me for getting so much attention the last few days. But here he was
            giving me a magic gift‚Ä¶.It made me blush almost as much as Annabeth.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúListen, Percy‚Ä¶‚Äù Luke looked uncomfortable. ‚ÄúA lot of hopes are riding on you. So
            just‚Ä¶kill some monsters for me, okay?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We shook hands. Luke patted Grover‚Äôs head between his horns, then gave a good-bye
            hug to Annabeth, who looked like she might pass out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After Luke was gone, I told her, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hyperventilating.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAm not.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou let him capture the flag instead of you, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶why do I want to go anywhere with you, Percy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She stomped down the other side of the hill, where a white SUV waited on the
            shoulder of the road. Argus followed, jingling his car keys.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I picked up the flying shoes and had a sudden bad feeling. I looked at Chiron. ‚ÄúI
            won‚Äôt be able to use these, will I?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He shook his head. ‚ÄúLuke meant well, Percy. But taking to the air‚Ä¶that would not be
            wise for you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I nodded, disappointed, but then I got an idea. ‚ÄúHey, Grover. You want a magic
            item?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His eyes lit up. ‚ÄúMe?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Pretty soon we‚Äôd laced the sneakers over his fake feet, and the world‚Äôs first
            flying goat boy was ready for launch.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúMaia!‚Äù</i> he shouted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He got off the ground okay, but then fell over sideways so his backpack dragged
            through the grass. The winged shoes kept bucking up and down like tiny broncos.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPractice,‚Äù Chiron called after him. ‚ÄúYou just need practice!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAaaaa!‚Äù Grover went flying sideways down the hill like a possessed lawn mower,
            heading toward the van.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before I could follow, Chiron caught my arm. ‚ÄúI should have trained you better,
            Percy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf only I had more time. Hercules, Jason&mdash;they all got more training.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-172" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. I just wish&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stopped myself because I was about to sound like a brat. I was wishing my dad had
            given me a cool magic item to help on the quest, something as good as Luke‚Äôs flying shoes, or
            Annabeth‚Äôs invisible cap.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat am I thinking?‚Äù Chiron cried. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let you get away without this.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He pulled a pen from his coat pocket and handed it to me. It was an ordinary
            disposable ballpoint, black ink, removable cap. Probably cost thirty cents.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGee,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy, that‚Äôs a gift from your father. I‚Äôve kept it for years, not knowing you
            were who I was waiting for. But the prophecy is clear to me now. You are the one.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I remembered the field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, when I‚Äôd vaporized
            Mrs. Dodds. Chiron had thrown me a pen that turned into a sword. Could this be‚Ä¶?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took off the cap, and the pen grew longer and heavier in my hand. In half a
            second, I held a shimmering bronze sword with a double-edged blade, a leather-wrapped grip, and a
            flat hilt riveted with gold studs. It was the first weapon that actually felt balanced in my hand.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe sword has a long and tragic history that we need not go into,‚Äù Chiron told me.
            ‚ÄúIts name is Anaklusmos.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú‚ÄòRiptide,‚Äô‚Äù I translated, surprised the Ancient Greek came so easily.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUse it only for emergencies,‚Äù Chiron said, ‚Äúand only against monsters. No hero
            should harm mortals unless absolutely necessary, of course, but this sword wouldn‚Äôt harm them in any
            case.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at the wickedly sharp blade. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean it wouldn‚Äôt harm mortals?
            How could it not?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe sword is celestial bronze. Forged by the Cyclopes, tempered in the heart of
            Mount Etna, cooled in the River Lethe. It‚Äôs deadly to monsters, to any creature from the Underworld,
            provided they don‚Äôt kill you first. But the blade will pass though mortals like an illusion. They
            simply are not important enough for the blade to kill. And I should warn you: as a demigod, you can
            be killed by either celestial or normal weapons. You are twice as vulnerable.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood to know.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNow recap the pen.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-173" class="calibre17">I touched the pen cap to the sword tip and instantly Riptide
            shrank to a ballpoint pen again. I tucked it in my pocket, a little nervous, because I was famous
            for losing pens at school.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt,‚Äù Chiron said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCan‚Äôt what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLose the pen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is enchanted. It will always reappear in your pocket.
            Try it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was wary, but I threw the pen as far as I could down the hill and watched it
            disappear in the grass.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt may take a few moments,‚Äù Chiron told me. ‚ÄúNow check your pocket.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Sure enough, the pen was there.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs <i class="calibre7">extremely</i> cool,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúBut what if a
            mortal sees me pulling out a sword?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron smiled. ‚ÄúMist is a powerful thing, Percy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMist?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes. Read <i class="calibre7">The Iliad</i>. It‚Äôs full of references to the stuff.
            Whenever divine or monstrous elements mix with the mortal world, they generate Mist, which obscures
            the vision of humans. You will see things just as they are, being a half-blood, but humans will
            interpret things quite differently. Remarkable, really, the lengths to which humans will go to fit
            things into their version of reality.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I put Riptide back in my pocket.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For the first time, the quest felt real. I was actually leaving Half-Blood Hill. I
            was heading west with no adult supervision, no backup plan, not even a cell phone. (Chiron said cell
            phones were traceable by monsters; if we used one, it would be worse than sending up a flare.) I had
            no weapon stronger than a sword to fight off monsters and reach the Land of the Dead.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúChiron‚Ä¶‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhen you say the gods are immortal‚Ä¶I mean, there was a time <i
              class="calibre7">before</i> them, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFour ages before them, actually. The Time of the Titans was the Fourth Age,
            sometimes called the Golden Age, which is definitely a misnomer. This, the time of Western
            civilization and the rule of Zeus, is the Fifth Age.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo what was it like‚Ä¶before the gods?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron pursed his lips. ‚ÄúEven I am not old enough to remember that, child, but I
            know it was a time of darkness and savagery for mortals. Kronos, the lord of the Titans, called his
            reign the Golden Age because men lived innocent and free of all knowledge. But that was mere
            propaganda. The Titan king cared nothing for your kind except as appetizers or a source of cheap
            entertainment. It was only in the early reign of Lord Zeus, when Prometheus the good Titan brought
            fire to mankind, that your species began to progress, and even then Prometheus was branded a radical
            thinker. Zeus punished him severely, as you may recall. Of course, eventually the gods warmed to
            humans, and Western civilization was born.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut the gods can‚Äôt die now, right? I mean, as long as
            Western civilization is alive, they‚Äôre alive. So‚Ä¶even if I failed, nothing could happen so bad it
            would mess up <i class="calibre7">everything</i>, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron gave me a melancholy smile. ‚ÄúNo one knows how long the Age of the West will
            last, Percy. The gods are immortal, yes. But then, so were the Titans. <i class="calibre7">They</i>
            still exist, locked away in their various prisons, forced to endure endless pain and punishment,
            reduced in power, but still very much alive. May the Fates forbid that the gods should ever suffer
            such a doom, or that we should ever return to the darkness and chaos of the past. All we can do,
            child, is follow our destiny.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOur destiny‚Ä¶assuming we know what that is.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù Chiron told me. ‚ÄúKeep a clear head. And remember, you may be about to
            prevent the biggest war in human history.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very relaxed.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When I got to the bottom of the hill, I looked back. Under the pine tree that used
            to be Thalia, daughter of Zeus, Chiron was now standing in full horse-man form, holding his bow high
            in salute. Just your typical summer-camp send-off by your typical centaur.</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Argus drove us out of the countryside and into western Long Island. It felt weird to
            be on a highway again, Annabeth and Grover sitting next to me as if we were normal carpoolers. After
            two weeks at Half-Blood Hill, the real world seemed like a fantasy. I found myself staring at every
            McDonald‚Äôs, every kid in the back of his parents‚Äô car, every billboard and shopping mall.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo far so good,‚Äù I told Annabeth. ‚ÄúTen miles and not a single monster.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She gave me an irritated look. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad luck to talk that way, Seaweed Brain.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRemind me again&mdash;why do you hate me so much?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCould‚Äôve fooled me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She folded her cap of invisibility. ‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶we‚Äôre just not supposed to get along,
            okay? Our parents are rivals.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-176" class="calibre17">She sighed. ‚ÄúHow many reasons do you want? One time my mom
            caught Poseidon with his girlfriend in Athena‚Äôs temple, which is <i class="calibre7">hugely</i>
            disrespectful. Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of
            Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree.
            The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey must really like olives.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, forget it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNow, if she invented pizza&mdash;<i class="calibre7">that</i> I could understand.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI said, forget it!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In the front seat, Argus smiled. He didn‚Äôt say anything, but one blue eye on the
            back of his neck winked at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Traffic slowed us down in Queens. By the time we got into Manhattan it was sunset
            and starting to rain.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Argus dropped us at the Greyhound Station on the Upper East Side, not far from my
            mom and Gabe‚Äôs apartment. Taped to a mailbox was a soggy flyer with my picture on it: <span
              class="calibre5">HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?</span></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I ripped it down before Annabeth and Grover could notice.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Argus unloaded our bags, made sure we got our bus tickets, then drove away, the eye
            on the back of his hand opening to watch us as he pulled out of the parking lot.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about how close I was to my old apartment. On a normal day, my mom would
            be home from the candy store by now. Smelly Gabe was probably up there right now, playing poker, not
            even missing her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shouldered his backpack. He gazed down the street in the direction I was
            looking. ‚ÄúYou want to know why she married him, Percy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at him. ‚ÄúWere you reading my mind or something?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúJust your emotions.‚Äù He shrugged. ‚ÄúGuess I forgot to tell you satyrs can do that.
            You were thinking about your mom and your stepdad, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I nodded, wondering what else Grover might‚Äôve forgotten to tell me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour mom married Gabe for <i class="calibre7">you</i>,‚Äù Grover told me. ‚ÄúYou call
            him ‚ÄòSmelly,‚Äô but you‚Äôve got no idea. The guy has this aura‚Ä¶.Yuck. I can smell him from here. I can
            smell traces of him on you, and you haven‚Äôt been near him for a week.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the nearest shower?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou should be grateful, Percy. Your stepfather smells so repulsively human he
            could mask the presence of any demigod. As soon as I took a whiff inside his Camaro, I knew: Gabe
            has been covering your scent for years. If you hadn‚Äôt lived with him every summer, you probably
            would‚Äôve been found by monsters a long time ago. Your mom stayed with him to protect you. She was a
            smart lady. She must‚Äôve loved you a lot to put up with that guy&mdash;if that makes you feel any
            better.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-177" class="calibre17">It didn‚Äôt, but I forced myself not to show it. I‚Äôll see her
            again, I thought. She isn‚Äôt gone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wondered if Grover could still read my emotions, mixed up as they were. I was
            glad he and Annabeth were with me, but I felt guilty that I hadn‚Äôt been straight with them. I hadn‚Äôt
            told them the real reason I‚Äôd said yes to this crazy quest.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The truth was, I didn‚Äôt care about retrieving Zeus‚Äôs lightning bolt, or saving the
            world, or even helping my father out of trouble. The more I thought about it, I resented Poseidon
            for never visiting me, never helping my mom, never even sending a lousy child-support check. He‚Äôd
            only claimed me because he needed a job done.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All I cared about was my mom. Hades had taken her unfairly, and Hades was going to
            give her back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">You will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend,</i> the
            Oracle whispered in my mind. <i class="calibre7">You will fail to save what matters most in the
              end.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Shut up,</i> I told it.</p>

          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The rain kept coming down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We got restless waiting for the bus and decided to play some Hacky Sack with one of
            Grover‚Äôs apples. Annabeth was unbelievable. She could bounce the apple off her knee, her elbow, her
            shoulder, whatever. I wasn‚Äôt too bad myself.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The game ended when I tossed the apple toward Grover and it got too close to his
            mouth. In one mega goat bite, our Hacky Sack disappeared&mdash; core, stem, and all.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover blushed. He tried to apologize, but Annabeth and I were too busy cracking
            up.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally the bus came. As we stood in line to board, Grover started looking around,
            sniffing the air like he smelled his favorite school cafeteria delicacy&mdash;enchiladas.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said tensely. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre17">But I could tell it wasn‚Äôt nothing. I started looking over my
            shoulder, too.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was relieved when we finally got on board and found seats together in the back of
            the bus. We stowed our backpacks. Annabeth kept slapping her Yankees cap nervously against her
            thigh.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As the last passengers got on, Annabeth clamped her hand onto my knee. ‚ÄúPercy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">An old lady had just boarded the bus. She wore a crumpled velvet dress, lace
            gloves, and a shapeless orange-knit hat that shadowed her face, and she carried a big paisley purse.
            When she tilted her head up, her black eyes glittered, and my heart skipped a beat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was Mrs. Dodds. Older, more withered, but definitely the same evil face.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I scrunched down in my seat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Behind her came two more old ladies: one in a green hat, one in a purple hat.
            Otherwise they looked exactly like Mrs. Dodds&mdash;same gnarled hands, paisley handbags, wrinkled
            velvet dresses. Triplet demon grandmothers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They sat in the front row, right behind the driver. The two on the aisle crossed
            their legs over the walkway, making an X. It was casual enough, but it sent a clear message: nobody
            leaves.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bus pulled out of the station, and we headed through the slick streets of
            Manhattan. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt stay dead long,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice from quivering. ‚ÄúI thought
            you said they could be dispelled for a lifetime.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI said if you‚Äôre <i class="calibre7">lucky</i>,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre obviously
            not.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll three of them,‚Äù Grover whipered. <i class="calibre7">‚ÄúDi immortales!‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Annabeth said, obviously thinking hard. ‚ÄúThe Furies. The three worst
            monsters from the Underworld. No problem. No problem. We‚Äôll just slip out the windows.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt open,‚Äù Grover moaned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA back exit?‚Äù she suggested.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There wasn‚Äôt one. Even if there had been, it wouldn‚Äôt have helped. By that time, we
            were on Ninth Avenue, heading for the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt attack us with witnesses around,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWill they?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMortals don‚Äôt have good eyes,‚Äù Annabeth reminded me. ‚ÄúTheir brains can only
            process what they see through the Mist.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey‚Äôll see three old ladies killing us, won‚Äôt they?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She thought about it. ‚ÄúHard to say. But we can‚Äôt count on mortals for help. Maybe
            an emergency exit in the roof‚Ä¶?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-179" class="calibre17">We hit the Lincoln Tunnel, and the bus went dark except for
            the running lights down the aisle. It was eerily quiet without the sound of the rain.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds got up. In a flat voice, as if she‚Äôd rehearsed it, she announced to the
            whole bus: ‚ÄúI need to use the restroom.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo do I,‚Äù said the second sister.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo do I,‚Äù said the third sister.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They all started down the aisle.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúPercy, take my hat.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one they want. Turn invisible and go up the aisle. Let them pass you.
            Maybe you can get to the front and get away.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut you guys&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an outside chance they might not notice us,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a son
            of one of the Big Three. Your smell might be overpowering.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just leave you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about us,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My hands trembled. I felt like a coward, but I took the Yankees cap and put it on.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">When I looked down, my body wasn‚Äôt there anymore.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I started creeping up the aisle. I managed to get up ten rows, then duck into an
            empty seat just as the Furies walked past.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds stopped, sniffing, and looked straight at me. My heart was pounding.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Apparently she didn‚Äôt see anything. She and her sisters kept going.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was free. I made it to the front of the bus. We were almost through the Lincoln
            Tunnel now. I was about to press the emergency stop button when I heard hideous wailing from the
            back row.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The old ladies were not old ladies anymore. Their faces were still the same&mdash;I
            guess those couldn‚Äôt get any uglier&mdash;but their bodies had shriveled into leathery brown hag
            bodies with bat‚Äôs wings and hands and feet like gargoyle claws. Their handbags had turned into fiery
            whips.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Furies surrounded Grover and Annabeth, lashing their whips, hissing: ‚ÄúWhere is
            it? Where?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The other people on the bus were screaming, cowering in their seats. They saw <i
              class="calibre7">something</i>, all right.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not here!‚Äù Annabeth yelled. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Furies raised their whips.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre17">Annabeth drew her bronze knife. Grover grabbed a tin can from
            his snack bag and prepared to throw it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">What I did next was so impulsive and dangerous I should‚Äôve been named ADHD poster
            child of the year.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bus driver was distracted, trying to see what was going on in his rearview
            mirror.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Still invisible, I grabbed the wheel from him and jerked it to the left. Everybody
            howled as they were thrown to the right, and I heard what I hoped was the sound of three Furies
            smashing against the windows.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù the driver yelled. ‚ÄúHey&mdash;whoa!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We wrestled for the wheel. The bus slammed against the side of the tunnel, grinding
            metal, throwing sparks a mile behind us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We careened out of the Lincoln Tunnel and back into the rainstorm, people and
            monsters tossed around the bus, cars plowed aside like bowling pins.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Somehow the driver found an exit. We shot off the highway, through half a dozen
            traffic lights, and ended up barreling down one of those New Jersey rural roads where you can‚Äôt
            believe there‚Äôs so much nothing right across the river from New York. There were woods to our left,
            the Hudson River to our right, and the driver seemed to be veering toward the river.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Another great idea: I hit the emergency brake.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bus wailed, spun a full circle on the wet asphalt, and crashed into the trees.
            The emergency lights came on. The door flew open. The bus driver was the first one out, the
            passengers yelling as they stampeded after him. I stepped into the driver‚Äôs seat and let them pass.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Furies regained their balance. They lashed their whips at Annabeth while she
            waved her knife and yelled in Ancient Greek, telling them to back off. Grover threw tin cans.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at the open doorway. I was free to go, but I couldn‚Äôt leave my friends. I
            took off the invisible cap. ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Furies turned, baring their yellow fangs at me, and the exit suddenly seemed
            like an excellent idea. Mrs. Dodds stalked up the aisle, just as she used to do in class, about to
            deliver my F- math test. Every time she flicked her whip, red flames danced along the barbed
            leather.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her two ugly sisters hopped on top of the seats on either side of her and crawled
            toward me like huge nasty lizards.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-181" class="calibre17">‚ÄúPerseus Jackson,‚Äù Mrs. Dodds said, in an accent that was
            definitely from somewhere farther south than Georgia. ‚ÄúYou have offended the gods. You shall die.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI liked you better as a math teacher,‚Äù I told her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She growled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover moved up behind the Furies cautiously, looking for an opening.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took the ballpoint pen out of my pocket and uncapped it. Riptide elongated into a
            shimmering double-edged sword.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre17">The Furies hesitated.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds had felt Riptide‚Äôs blade before. She obviously didn‚Äôt like seeing it
            again.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSubmit now,‚Äù she hissed. ‚ÄúAnd you will not suffer eternal torment.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNice try,‚Äù I told her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy, look out!‚Äù Annabeth cried.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds lashed her whip around my sword hand while the Furies on the either side
            lunged at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My hand felt like it was wrapped in molten lead, but I managed not to drop Riptide.
            I stuck the Fury on the left with its hilt, sending her toppling backward into a seat. I turned and
            sliced the Fury on the right. As soon as the blade connected with her neck, she screamed and
            exploded into dust. Annabeth got Mrs. Dodds in a wrestler‚Äôs hold and yanked her backward while
            Grover ripped the whip out of her hands.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOw!‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúOw! Hot! Hot!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Fury I‚Äôd hilt-slammed came at me again, talons ready, but I swung Riptide and
            she broke open like a pi√±ata.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Mrs. Dodds was trying to get Annabeth off her back. She kicked, clawed, hissed, and
            bit, but Annabeth held on while Grover got Mrs. Dodds‚Äôs legs tied up in her own whip. Finally they
            both shoved her backward into the aisle. Mrs. Dodds tried to get up, but she didn‚Äôt have room to
            flap her bat wings, so she kept falling down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúZeus will destroy you!‚Äù she promised. ‚ÄúHades will have your soul!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúBraccas meas vescimini!‚Äù</i> I yelled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt sure where the Latin came from. I think it meant ‚ÄúEat my pants!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Thunder shook the bus. The hair rose on the back of my neck.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù Annabeth yelled at me. ‚ÄúNow!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt need any encouragement.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We rushed outside and found the other passengers wandering around in a daze,
            arguing with the driver, or running around in circles yelling, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to die!‚Äù A
            Hawaiian-shirted tourist with a camera snapped my photograph before I could recap my sword.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOur bags!‚Äù Grover realized. ‚ÄúWe left our&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">BOOOOOM!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The windows of the bus exploded as the passengers ran for cover. Lightning shredded
            a huge crater in the road, but an angry wail from inside told me Mrs. Dodds was not yet dead.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre17">‚ÄúRun!‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs calling for reinforcements! We
            have to get out of here!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We plunged into the woods as the rain poured down, the bus in flames behind us, and
            nothing but darkness ahead.</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 11: WE VISIT THE GARDEN GNOME EMPORIUM</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">I</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">N A WAY, IT‚ÄôS
              NICE TO KNOW THERE ARE</span> Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame when
            things go wrong. For instance, when you‚Äôre walking away from a bus that‚Äôs just been attacked by
            monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it‚Äôs raining on top of everything else, most people
            might think that‚Äôs just really bad luck; when you‚Äôre a half-blood, you understand that some divine
            force really is trying to mess up your day.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">So there we were, Annabeth and Grover and I, walking through the woods along the
            New Jersey riverbank, the glow of New York City making the night sky yellow behind us, and the smell
            of the Hudson reeking in our noses.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was shivering and braying, his big goat eyes turned slit-pupiled and full of
            terror. ‚ÄúThree Kindly Ones. All three at once.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was pretty much in shock myself. The explosion of bus windows still rang in my
            ears. But Annabeth kept pulling us along, saying: ‚ÄúCome on! The farther away we get, the better.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll our money was back there,‚Äù I reminded her. ‚ÄúOur food and clothes. Everything.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, maybe if you hadn‚Äôt decided to jump into the fight&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-186" class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat did you want me to do? Let you get killed?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt need to protect me, Percy. I would‚Äôve been fine.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSliced like sandwich bread,‚Äù Grover put in, ‚Äúbut fine.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShut up, goat boy,‚Äù said Annabeth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover brayed mournfully. ‚ÄúTin cans‚Ä¶a perfectly good bag of tin cans.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We sloshed across mushy ground, through nasty twisted trees that smelled like sour
            laundry.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After a few minutes, Annabeth fell into line next to me. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice
            faltered. ‚ÄúI appreciate your coming back for us, okay? That was really brave.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a team, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She was silent for a few more steps. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that if you died‚Ä¶aside from the
            fact that it would really suck for you, it would mean the quest was over. This may be my only chance
            to see the real world.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The thunderstorm had finally let up. The city glow faded behind us, leaving us in
            almost total darkness. I couldn‚Äôt see anything of Annabeth except a glint of her blond hair.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt left Camp Half-Blood since you were seven?‚Äù I asked her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶only short field trips. My dad&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe history professor.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah. It didn‚Äôt work out for me living at home. I mean, Camp Half-Blood <i
              class="calibre7">is</i> my home.‚Äù She was rushing her words out now, as if she were afraid
            somebody might try to stop her. ‚ÄúAt camp you train and train. And that‚Äôs all cool and everything,
            but the real world is where the monsters are. That‚Äôs where you learn whether you‚Äôre any good or
            not.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">If I didn‚Äôt know better, I could‚Äôve sworn I heard doubt in her voice.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty good with that knife,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnybody who can piggyback-ride a Fury is okay by me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt really see, but I thought she might‚Äôve smiled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúmaybe I should tell you‚Ä¶Something funny back on the bus‚Ä¶‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Whatever she wanted to say was interrupted by a shrill <i
              class="calibre7">toot-toot-toot</i>, like the sound of an owl being tortured.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, my reed pipes still work!‚Äù Grover cried. ‚ÄúIf I could just remember a ‚Äòfind
            path‚Äô song, we could get out of these woods!‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre17">He puffed out a few notes, but the tune still sounded
            suspiciously like Hilary Duff.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Instead of finding a path, I immediately slammed into a tree and got a nice-size
            knot on my head.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Add to the list of superpowers I did <i class="calibre7">not</i> have: infrared
            vision.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After tripping and cursing and generally feeling miserable for another mile or so,
            I started to see light up ahead: the colors of a neon sign. I could smell food. Fried, greasy,
            excellent food. I realized I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything unhealthy since I‚Äôd arrived at Half-Blood Hill,
            where we lived on grapes, bread, cheese, and extra-lean-cut nymph-prepared barbecue. This boy needed
            a double cheeseburger.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We kept walking until I saw a deserted two-lane road through the trees. On the
            other side was a closed-down gas station, a tattered billboard for a 1990s movie, and one open
            business, which was the source of the neon light and the good smell.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It wasn‚Äôt a fast-food restaurant like I‚Äôd hoped. It was one of those weird roadside
            curio shops that sell lawn flamingos and wooden Indians and cement grizzly bears and stuff like
            that. The main building was a long, low warehouse, surrounded by acres of statuary. The neon sign
            above the gate was impossible for me to read, because if there‚Äôs anything worse for my dyslexia than
            regular English, it‚Äôs red cursive neon English.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">To me, it looked like: <span class="calibre5"><i class="calibre7">atnyu mes gderan
                gomen meprouim</i></span>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat the heck does that say?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She loved reading so much, I‚Äôd forgotten she was dyslexic, too.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover translated: ‚ÄúAunty Em‚Äôs Garden Gnome Emporium.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Flanking the entrance, as advertised, were two cement garden gnomes, ugly bearded
            little runts, smiling and waving, as if they were about to get their picture taken.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I crossed the street, following the smell of the hamburgers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶‚Äù Grover warned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe lights are on inside,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs open.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSnack bar,‚Äù I said wistfully.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSnack bar,‚Äù she agreed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAre you two crazy?‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúThis place is weird.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We ignored him.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-188" class="calibre17">The front lot was a forest of statues: cement animals, cement
            children, even a cement satyr playing the pipes, which gave Grover the creeps.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúBlah-ha-ha!‚Äù</i> he bleated. ‚ÄúLooks like my Uncle Ferdinand!‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">We stopped at the warehouse door.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt knock,‚Äù Grover pleaded. ‚ÄúI smell monsters.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour nose is clogged up from the Furies,‚Äù Annabeth told him. ‚ÄúAll I smell is
            burgers. Aren‚Äôt you hungry?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMeat!‚Äù he said scornfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a vegetarian.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou eat cheese enchiladas and aluminum cans,‚Äù I reminded him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThose are vegetables. Come on. Let‚Äôs leave. These statues are‚Ä¶looking at me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then the door creaked open, and standing in front of us was a tall Middle Eastern
            woman&mdash;at least, I assumed she was Middle Eastern, because she wore a long black gown that
            covered everything but her hands, and her head was completely veiled. Her eyes glinted behind a
            curtain of black gauze, but that was about all I could make out. Her coffee-colored hands looked
            old, but well-manicured and elegant, so I imagined she was a grandmother who had once been a
            beautiful lady.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her accent sounded vaguely Middle Eastern, too. She said, ‚ÄúChildren, it is too late
            to be out all alone. Where are your parents?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶‚Äù Annabeth started to say.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre orphans,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOrphans?‚Äù the woman said. The word sounded alien in her mouth. ‚ÄúBut, my dears!
            Surely not!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe got separated from our caravan,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOur circus caravan. The ringmaster
            told us to meet him at the gas station if we got lost, but he may have forgotten, or maybe he meant
            a different gas station. Anyway, we‚Äôre lost. Is that food I smell?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, my dears,‚Äù the woman said. ‚ÄúYou must come in, poor children. I am Aunty Em. Go
            straight through to the back of the warehouse, please. There is a dining area.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We thanked her and went inside.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth muttered to me, ‚ÄúCircus caravan?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAlways have a strategy, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour head is full of kelp.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The warehouse was filled with more statues&mdash;people in all different poses,
            wearing all different outfits and with different expressions on their faces. I was thinking you‚Äôd
            have to have a pretty huge garden to fit even one of these statues, because they were all life-size.
            But mostly, I was thinking about food.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Go ahead, call me an idiot for walking into a strange lady‚Äôs shop like that just
            because I was hungry, but I do impulsive stuff sometimes. Plus, you‚Äôve never smelled Aunty Em‚Äôs
            burgers. The aroma was like laughing gas in the dentist‚Äôs chair&mdash;it made everything else go
            away. I barely noticed Grover‚Äôs nervous whimpers, or the way the statues‚Äô eyes seemed to follow me,
            or the fact that Aunty Em had locked the door behind us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All I cared about was finding the dining area. And sure enough, there it was at the
            back of the warehouse, a fast-food counter with a grill, a soda fountain, a pretzel heater, and a
            nacho cheese dispenser. Everything you could want, plus a few steel picnic tables out front.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPlease, sit down,‚Äù Aunty Em said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAwesome,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm,‚Äù Grover said reluctantly, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have any money, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before I could jab him in the ribs, Aunty Em said, ‚ÄúNo, no, children. No money.
            This is a special case, yes? It is my treat, for such nice orphans.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThank you, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre17">Aunty Em stiffened, as if Annabeth had done something wrong,
            but then the old woman relaxed just as quickly, so I figured it must‚Äôve been my imagination.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúQuite all right, Annabeth,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou have such beautiful gray eyes, child.‚Äù
            Only later did I wonder how she knew Annabeth‚Äôs name, even though we had never introduced ourselves.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Our hostess disappeared behind the snack counter and started cooking. Before we
            knew it, she‚Äôd brought us plastic trays heaped with double cheeseburgers, vanilla shakes, and XXL
            servings of French fries.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was halfway through my burger before I remembered to breathe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth slurped her shake.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover picked at the fries, and eyed the tray‚Äôs waxed paper liner as if he might go
            for that, but he still looked too nervous to eat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that hissing noise?‚Äù he asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I listened, but didn‚Äôt hear anything. Annabeth shook her head.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHissing?‚Äù Aunty Em asked. ‚ÄúPerhaps you hear the deep-fryer oil. You have keen
            ears, Grover.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI take vitamins. For my ears.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs admirable,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut please, relax.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Aunty Em ate nothing. She hadn‚Äôt taken off her headdress, even to cook, and now she
            sat forward and interlaced her fingers and watched us eat. It was a little unsettling, having
            someone stare at me when I couldn‚Äôt see her face, but I was feeling satisfied after the burger, and
            a little sleepy, and I figured the least I could do was try to make small talk with our hostess.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo, you sell gnomes,‚Äù I said, trying to sound interested.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù Aunty Em said. ‚ÄúAnd animals. And people. Anything for the garden. Custom
            orders. Statuary is very popular, you know.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA lot of business on this road?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot so much, no. Since the highway was built‚Ä¶most cars, they do not go this way
            now. I must cherish every customer I get.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My neck tingled, as if somebody else was looking at me. I turned, but it was just a
            statue of a young girl holding an Easter basket. The detail was incredible, much better than you see
            in most garden statues. But something was wrong with her face. It looked as if she were startled, or
            even terrified.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh,‚Äù Aunty Em said sadly. ‚ÄúYou notice some of my creations do not turn out well.
            They are marred. They do not sell. The face is the hardest to get right. Always the face.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou make these statues yourself?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, yes. Once upon a time, I had two sisters to help me in the business, but they
            have passed on, and Aunty Em is alone. I have only my statues. This is why I make them, you see.
            They are my company.‚Äù The sadness in her voice sounded so deep and so real that I couldn‚Äôt help
            feeling sorry for her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth had stopped eating. She sat forward and said, ‚ÄúTwo sisters?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible story,‚Äù Aunty Em said. ‚ÄúNot one for children, really. You see,
            Annabeth, a bad woman was jealous of me, long ago when I was young. I had a‚Ä¶a boyfriend, you know,
            and this bad woman was determined to break us apart. She caused a terrible accident. My sisters
            stayed by me. They shared my bad fortune as long as they could, but eventually they passed on. They
            faded away. I alone have survived, but at a price. Such a price.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt sure what she meant, but I felt bad for her. My eyelids kept getting
            heavier, my full stomach making me sleepy. Poor old lady. Who would want to hurt somebody so nice?
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy?‚Äù Annabeth was shaking me to get my attention. ‚ÄúMaybe we should go. I mean,
            the ringmaster will be waiting.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She sounded tense. I wasn‚Äôt sure why. Grover was eating the waxed paper off the
            tray now, but if Aunty Em found that strange, she didn‚Äôt say anything.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSuch beautiful gray eyes,‚Äù Aunty Em told Annabeth again. ‚ÄúMy, yes, it has been a
            long time since I‚Äôve seen gray eyes like those.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She reached out as if to stroke Annabeth‚Äôs cheek, but Annabeth stood up abruptly.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe really should go.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Grover swallowed his waxed paper and stood up. ‚ÄúThe ringmaster is waiting!
            Right!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt want to leave. I felt full and content. Aunty Em was so nice. I wanted to
            stay with her a while.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPlease, dears,‚Äù Aunty Em pleaded. ‚ÄúI so rarely get to be with children. Before you
            go, won‚Äôt you at least sit for a pose?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA pose?‚Äù Annabeth asked warily.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA photograph. I will use it to model a new statue set. Children are so popular,
            you see. Everyone loves children.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-194" class="calibre17">Annabeth shifted her weight from foot to foot. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think
            we can, ma‚Äôam. Come on, Percy&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSure we can,‚Äù I said. I was irritated with Annabeth for being so bossy, so rude to
            an old lady who‚Äôd just fed us for free. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a photo, Annabeth. What‚Äôs the harm?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, Annabeth,‚Äù the woman purred. ‚ÄúNo harm.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I could tell Annabeth didn‚Äôt like it, but she allowed Aunty Em to lead us back out
            the front door, into the garden of statues.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Aunty Em directed us to a park bench next to the stone satyr. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù she said,
            ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just position you correctly. The young girl in the middle, I think, and the two young
            gentlemen on either side.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot much light for a photo,‚Äù I remarked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, enough,‚Äù Aunty Em said. ‚ÄúEnough for us to see each other, yes?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your camera?‚Äù Grover asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Aunty Em stepped back, as if to admire the shot. ‚ÄúNow, the face is the most
            difficult. Can you smile for me please, everyone? A large smile?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover glanced at the cement satyr next to him, and mumbled, ‚ÄúThat sure does look
            like Uncle Ferdinand.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover,‚Äù Aunty Em chastised, ‚Äúlook this way, dear.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She still had no camera in her hands.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy&mdash;‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Some instinct warned me to listen to Annabeth, but I was fighting the sleepy
            feeling, the comfortable lull that came from the food and the old lady‚Äôs voice.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI will just be a moment,‚Äù Aunty Em said. ‚ÄúYou know, I can‚Äôt see you very well in
            this cursed veil‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy, something‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù Annabeth insisted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWrong?‚Äù Aunty Em said, reaching up to undo the wrap around her head. ‚ÄúNot at all,
            dear. I have such noble company tonight. What could be wrong?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat <i class="calibre7">is</i> Uncle Ferdinand!‚Äù Grover gasped.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre17">‚ÄúLook away from her!‚Äù Annabeth shouted. She whipped her
            Yankees cap onto her head and vanished. Her invisible hands pushed Grover and me both off the bench.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was on the ground, looking at Aunt Em‚Äôs sandaled feet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I could hear Grover scrambling off in one direction, Annabeth in another. But I was
            too dazed to move.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I heard a strange, rasping sound above me. My eyes rose to Aunty Em‚Äôs hands,
            which had turned gnarled and warty, with sharp bronze talons for fingernails.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I almost looked higher, but somewhere off to my left Annabeth screamed, ‚ÄúNo!
            Don‚Äôt!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">More rasping&mdash;the sound of tiny snakes, right above me, from‚Ä¶from about where
            Aunty Em‚Äôs head would be.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRun!‚Äù Grover bleated. I heard him racing across the gravel, yelling <i
              class="calibre7">‚ÄúMaia!‚Äù</i> to kick-start his flying sneakers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt move. I stared at Aunty Em‚Äôs gnarled claws, and tried to fight the
            groggy trance the old woman had put me in.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSuch a pity to destroy a handsome young face,‚Äù she told me soothingly. ‚ÄúStay with
            me, Percy. All you have to do is look up.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I fought the urge to obey. Instead I looked to one side and saw one of those glass
            spheres people put in gardens&mdash;a gazing ball. I could see Aunty Em‚Äôs dark reflection in the
            orange glass; her headdress was gone, revealing her face as a shimmering pale circle. Her hair was
            moving, writhing like serpents.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre17">Aunty Em.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Aunty ‚ÄúM.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">How could I have been so stupid?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Think, I told myself. How did Medusa die in the myth?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But I couldn‚Äôt think. Something told me that in the myth Medusa had been asleep
            when she was attacked by my namesake, Perseus. She wasn‚Äôt anywhere near asleep now. If she wanted,
            she could take those talons right now and rake open my face.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Gray-Eyed One did this to me, Percy,‚Äù Medusa said, and she didn‚Äôt sound
            anything like a monster. Her voice invited me to look up, to sympathize with a poor old grandmother.
            ‚ÄúAnnabeth‚Äôs mother, the cursed Athena, turned me from a beautiful woman into this.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt listen to her!‚Äù Annabeth‚Äôs voice shouted, somewhere in the statuary. ‚ÄúRun,
            Percy!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSilence!‚Äù Medusa snarled. Then her voice modulated back to a comforting purr. ‚ÄúYou
            see why I must destroy the girl, Percy. She is my enemy‚Äôs daughter. I shall crush her statue to
            dust. But you, dear Percy, you need not suffer.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I muttered. I tried to make my legs move.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDo you really want to help the gods?‚Äù Medusa asked. ‚ÄúDo you understand what awaits
            you on this foolish quest, Percy? What will happen if you reach the Underworld? Do not be a pawn of
            the Olympians, my dear. You would be better off as a statue. Less pain. Less pain.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy!‚Äù Behind me, I heard a buzzing sound, like a two-hundred-pound hummingbird
            in a nosedive. Grover yelled, ‚ÄúDuck!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned, and there he was in the night sky, flying in from twelve o‚Äôclock with his
            winged shoes fluttering, Grover, holding a tree branch the size of a baseball bat. His eyes were
            shut tight, his head twitched from side to side. He was navigating by ears and nose alone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDuck!‚Äù he yelled again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get her!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That finally jolted me into action. Knowing Grover, I was sure he‚Äôd miss Medusa and
            nail me. I dove to one side.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Thwack!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">At first, I figured it was the sound of Grover hitting a tree. Then Medusa roared
            with rage.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou miserable satyr,‚Äù she snarled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll add you to my collection!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat was for Uncle Ferdinand!‚Äù Grover yelled back.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre17">I scrambled away and hid in the statuary while Grover swooped
            down for another pass.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Ker-whack!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúArrgh!‚Äù Medusa yelled, her snake-hair hissing and spitting.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Right next to me, Annabeth‚Äôs voice said, ‚ÄúPercy!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I jumped so high my feet nearly cleared a garden gnome. ‚ÄúJeez! Don‚Äôt do that!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth took off her Yankees cap and became visible. ‚ÄúYou have to cut her head
            off.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat? Are you crazy? Let‚Äôs get out of here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMedusa is a menace. She‚Äôs evil. I‚Äôd kill her myself, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Annabeth swallowed, as
            if she were about to make a difficult admission. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôve got the better weapon. Besides, I‚Äôd
            never get close to her. She‚Äôd slice me to bits because of my mother. You&mdash;you‚Äôve got a chance.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat? I can‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLook, do you want her turning more innocent people into statues?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She pointed to a pair of statue lovers, a man and a woman with their arms around
            each other, turned to stone by the monster.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth grabbed a green gazing ball from a nearby pedestal. ‚ÄúA polished shield
            would be better.‚Äù She studied the sphere critically. ‚ÄúThe convexity will cause some distortion. The
            reflection‚Äôs size should be off by a factor of&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWould you speak English?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI <i class="calibre7">am</i>!‚Äù She tossed me the glass ball. ‚ÄúJust look at her in
            the glass. <i class="calibre7">Never</i> look at her directly.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, guys!‚Äù Grover yelled somewhere above us. ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs unconscious!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúRoooaaarrr!‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMaybe not,‚Äù Grover corrected. He went in for another pass with the tree branch.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHurry,‚Äù Annabeth told me. ‚ÄúGrover‚Äôs got a great nose, but he‚Äôll eventually crash.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took out my pen and uncapped it. The bronze blade of Riptide elongated in my
            hand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I followed the hissing and spitting sounds of Medusa‚Äôs hair.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I kept my eyes locked on the gazing ball so I would only glimpse Medusa‚Äôs
            reflection, not the real thing. Then, in the green tinted glass, I saw her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was coming in for another turn at bat, but this time he flew a little too
            low. Medusa grabbed the stick and pulled him off course. He tumbled through the air and crashed into
            the arms of a stone grizzly bear with a painful ‚ÄúUmmphh!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Medusa was about to lunge at him when I yelled, ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I advanced on her, which wasn‚Äôt easy, holding a sword and a glass ball. If she
            charged, I‚Äôd have a hard time defending myself.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But then she let me approach&mdash;twenty feet, ten feet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I could see the reflection of her face now. Surely it wasn‚Äôt really <i
              class="calibre7">that</i> ugly. The green swirls of the gazing ball must be distorting it,
            making it look worse.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt harm an old woman, Percy,‚Äù she crooned. ‚ÄúI know you wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I hesitated, fascinated by the face I saw reflected in the glass&mdash;the eyes
            that seemed to burn straight through the green tint, making my arms go weak.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">From the cement grizzly, Grover moaned, ‚ÄúPercy, don‚Äôt listen to her!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Medusa cackled. ‚ÄúToo late.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She lunged at me with her talons.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre17">I slashed up with my sword, heard a sickening <i
              class="calibre7">shlock!</i>, then a hiss like wind rushing out of a cavern&mdash;the sound of a
            monster disintegrating.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Something fell to the ground next to my foot. It took all my willpower not to look.
            I could feel warm ooze soaking into my sock, little dying snake heads tugging at my shoelaces.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, yuck,‚Äù Grover said. His eyes were still tightly closed, but I guess he could
            hear the thing gurgling and streaming. ‚ÄúMega-yuck.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth came up next to me, her eyes fixed on the sky. She was holding Medusa‚Äôs
            black veil. She said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Very, very carefully, without looking down, she knelt and draped the monster‚Äôs head
            in black cloth, then picked it up. It was still dripping green juice.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù she asked me, her voice trembling.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I decided, though I felt like throwing up my double cheeseburger. ‚ÄúWhy
            didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶why didn‚Äôt the head evaporate?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOnce you sever it, it becomes a spoil of war,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSame as your minotaur
            horn. But don‚Äôt unwrap the head. It can still petrify you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover moaned as he climbed down from the grizzly statue. He had a big welt on his
            forehead. His green rasta cap hung from one of his little goat horns, and his fake feet had been
            knocked off his hooves. The magic sneakers were flying aimlessly around his head.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Red Baron,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGood job, man.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He managed a bashful grin. ‚ÄúThat really was <i class="calibre7">not</i> fun,
            though. Well, the hitting-her-with-a-stick part, that was fun. But crashing into a concrete bear? <i
              class="calibre7">Not</i> fun.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He snatched his shoes out of the air. I recapped my sword. Together, the three of
            us stumbled back to the warehouse.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We found some old plastic grocery bags behind the snack counter and double-wrapped
            Medusa‚Äôs head. We plopped it on the table where we‚Äôd eaten dinner and sat around it, too exhausted
            to speak.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally I said, ‚ÄúSo we have Athena to thank for this monster?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth flashed me an irritated look. ‚ÄúYour dad, actually. Don‚Äôt you remember?
            Medusa was Poseidon‚Äôs girlfriend. They decided to meet in my mother‚Äôs temple. That‚Äôs why Athena
            turned her into a monster. Medusa and her two sisters who had helped her get into the temple, they
            became the three gorgons. That‚Äôs why Medusa wanted to slice me up, but she wanted to preserve you as
            a nice statue. She‚Äôs still sweet on your dad. You probably reminded her of him.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre17">My face was burning. ‚ÄúOh, so now it‚Äôs <i class="calibre7">my</i>
            fault we met Medusa.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth straightened. In a bad imitation of my voice, she said: ‚Äú‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just a
            photo, Annabeth. What‚Äôs the harm?‚Äô‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúForget it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre impossible.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insufferable.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Grover interrupted. ‚ÄúYou two are giving me a migraine, and satyrs don‚Äôt even
            <i class="calibre7">get</i> migraines. What are we going to do with the head?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at the thing. One little snake was hanging out of a hole in the plastic.
            The words printed on the side of the bag said: <span class="calibre5">WE APPRECIATE YOUR</span>
            <span class="calibre5">BUSINESS!</span>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was angry, not just with Annabeth or her mom, but with all the gods for this
            whole quest, for getting us blown off the road and in two major fights the very first day out from
            camp. At this rate, we‚Äôd never make it to L.A. alive, much less before the summer solstice.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">What had Medusa said?</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Do not be a pawn of the Olympians, my dear. You would be better
              off as a statue.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Annabeth called after me. ‚ÄúWhat are you&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I searched the back of the warehouse until I found Medusa‚Äôs office. Her account
            book showed her six most recent sales, all shipments to the Underworld to decorate Hades and
            Persephone‚Äôs garden. According to one freight bill, the Underworld‚Äôs billing address was DOA
            Recording Studios, West Hollywood, California. I folded up the bill and stuffed it in my pocket.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In the cash register I found twenty dollars, a few golden drachmas, and some
            packing slips for Hermes Overnight Express, each with a little leather bag attached for coins. I
            rummaged around the rest of the office until I found the right-size box.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I went back to the picnic table, packed up Medusa‚Äôs head, and filled out a delivery
            slip:</p>

          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to like that,‚Äù Grover warned. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll think you‚Äôre
            impertinent.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I poured some golden drachmas in the pouch. As soon as I closed it, there was a
            sound like a cash register. The package floated off the table and disappeared with a <i

          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI <i class="calibre7">am</i> impertinent,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at Annabeth, daring her to criticize.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She didn‚Äôt. She seemed resigned to the fact that I had a major talent for ticking
            off the gods. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúWe need a new plan.‚Äù</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 12: WE GET ADVICE FROM A POODLE</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">W</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">E WERE PRETTY
              MISERABLE THAT</span> night. We camped out in the woods, a hundred yards from the main road, in
            a marshy clearing that local kids had obviously been using for parties. The ground was littered with
            flattened soda cans and fast-food wrappers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We‚Äôd taken some food and blankets from Aunty Em‚Äôs, but we didn‚Äôt dare light a fire
            to dry our damp clothes. The Furies and Medusa had provided enough excitement for one day. We didn‚Äôt
            want to attract anything else.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We decided to sleep in shifts. I volunteered to take first watch.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth curled up on the blankets and was snoring as soon as her head hit the
            ground. Grover fluttered with his flying shoes to the lowest bough of a tree, put his back to the
            trunk, and stared at the night sky.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGo ahead and sleep,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wake you if there‚Äôs trouble.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He nodded, but still didn‚Äôt close his eyes. ‚ÄúIt makes me sad, Percy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat does? The fact that you signed up for this stupid quest?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo. <i class="calibre7">This</i> makes me sad.‚Äù He pointed at all the garbage on
            the ground. ‚ÄúAnd the sky. You can‚Äôt even see the stars. They‚Äôve polluted the sky. This is a terrible
            time to be a satyr.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, yeah. I guess you‚Äôd be an environmentalist.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre17">He glared at me. ‚ÄúOnly a human wouldn‚Äôt be. Your species is
            clogging up the world so fast‚Ä¶ah, never mind. It‚Äôs useless to lecture a human. At the rate things
            are going, I‚Äôll never find Pan.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPam? Like the cooking spray?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPan!‚Äù he cried indignantly. ‚ÄúP-A-N. The great god Pan! What do you think I want a
            searcher‚Äôs license for?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A strange breeze rustled through the clearing, temporarily overpowering the stink
            of trash and muck. It brought the smell of berries and wildflowers and clean rainwater, things that
            might‚Äôve once been in these woods. Suddenly I was nostalgic for something I‚Äôd never known.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTell me about the search,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre17">Grover looked at me cautiously, as if he were afraid I was
            just making fun.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe God of Wild Places disappeared two thousand years ago,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúA sailor
            off the coast of Ephesos heard a mysterious voice crying out from the shore, ‚ÄòTell them that the
            great god Pan has died!‚Äô When humans heard the news, they believed it. They‚Äôve been pillaging Pan‚Äôs
            kingdoms ever since. But for the satyrs, Pan was our lord and master. He protected us and the wild
            places of the earth. We refuse to believe that he died. In every generation, the bravest satyrs
            pledge their lives to finding Pan. They search the earth, exploring all the wildest places, hoping
            to find where he is hidden, and wake him from his sleep.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd you want to be a searcher.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my life‚Äôs dream,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy father was a searcher. And my Uncle
            Ferdinand‚Ä¶the statue you saw back there&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, right, sorry.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shook his head. ‚ÄúUncle Ferdinand knew the risks. So did my dad. But I‚Äôll
            succeed. I‚Äôll be the first searcher to return alive.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHang on&mdash;<i class="calibre7">the first?</i>‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover took his reed pipes out of his pocket. ‚ÄúNo searcher has ever come back. Once
            they set out, they disappear. They‚Äôre never seen alive again.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot once in two thousand years?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd your dad? You have no idea what happened to him?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNone.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut you still want to go,‚Äù I said, amazed. ‚ÄúI mean, you really think you‚Äôll be the
            one to find Pan?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI have to believe that, Percy. Every searcher does. It‚Äôs the only thing that keeps
            us from despair when we look at what humans have done to the world. I have to believe Pan can still
            be awakened.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at the orange haze of the sky and tried to understand how Grover could
            pursue a dream that seemed so hopeless. Then again, was I any better?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow are we going to get into the Underworld?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúI mean, what chance do
            we have against a god?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúBut back at Medusa‚Äôs, when you were searching her
            office? Annabeth was telling me&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, I forgot. Annabeth will have a plan all figured out.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so hard on her, Percy. She‚Äôs had a tough life, but
            she‚Äôs a good person. After all, she forgave me‚Ä¶.‚Äù His voice faltered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúForgave you for what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Suddenly, Grover seemed very interested in playing notes on his pipes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWait a minute,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYour first keeper job was five years ago. Annabeth has
            been at camp five years. She wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶I mean, your first assignment that went wrong&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk about it,‚Äù Grover said, and his quivering lower lip suggested he‚Äôd
            start crying if I pressed him. ‚ÄúBut as I was saying, back at Medusa‚Äôs, Annabeth and I agreed there‚Äôs
            something strange going on with this quest. Something isn‚Äôt what it seems.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, duh. I‚Äôm getting blamed for stealing a thunderbolt that Hades took.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I mean,‚Äù Grover said. The Fur&mdash;The Kindly Ones were sort of
            holding back. Like Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy‚Ä¶why did she wait so long to try to kill you? Then on
            the bus, they just weren‚Äôt as aggressive as they could‚Äôve been.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey seemed plenty aggressive to me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shook his head. ‚ÄúThey were screeching at us: ‚ÄòWhere is it? Where?‚Äô‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAsking about me,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶but Annabeth and I, we both got the feeling they weren‚Äôt asking about a
            person. They said ‚ÄòWhere is <i class="calibre7">it</i>?‚Äô They seemed to be asking about an object.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI know. But if we‚Äôve misunderstood something about this quest, and we only have
            nine days to find the master bolt‚Ä¶‚Äù He looked at me like he was hoping for answers, but I didn‚Äôt
            have any.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about what Medusa had said: I was being used by the gods. What lay ahead
            of me was worse than petrification. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been straight with you,‚Äù I told Grover. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care
            about the master bolt. I agreed to go to the Underworld so I could bring back my mother.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover blew a soft note on his pipes. ‚ÄúI know that, Percy. But are you sure that‚Äôs
            the only reason?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing it to help my father. He doesn‚Äôt care about me. I don‚Äôt care about
            him.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre17">Grover gazed down from his tree branch. ‚ÄúLook, Percy, I‚Äôm not
            as smart as Annabeth. I‚Äôm not as brave as you. But I‚Äôm pretty good at reading emotions. You‚Äôre glad
            your dad is alive. You feel good that he‚Äôs claimed you, and part of you wants to make him proud.
            That‚Äôs why you mailed Medusa‚Äôs head to Olympus. You wanted him to notice what you‚Äôd done.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah? Well, maybe satyr emotions work differently than human emotions. Because
            you‚Äôre wrong. I don‚Äôt care what he thinks.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover pulled his feet up onto the branch. ‚ÄúOkay, Percy. Whatever.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBesides, I haven‚Äôt done anything worth bragging about. We barely got out of New
            York and we‚Äôre stuck here with no money and no way west.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover looked at the night sky, like he was thinking about that problem. ‚ÄúHow about
            <i class="calibre7">I</i> take first watch, huh? You get some sleep.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to protest, but he started to play Mozart, soft and sweet, and I turned
            away, my eyes stinging. After a few bars of Piano Concerto no. 12, I was asleep.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">In my dreams, I stood in a dark cavern before a gaping pit. Gray mist creatures
            churned all around me, whispering rags of smoke that I somehow knew were the spirits of the dead.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">They tugged at my clothes, trying to pull me back, but I felt compelled to walk
            forward to the very edge of the chasm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Looking down made me dizzy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The pit yawned so wide and was so completely black, I knew it must be bottomless.
            Yet I had a feeling that something was trying to rise from the abyss, something huge and evil.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">The little hero,</i> an amused voice echoed far down in the
            darkness. <i class="calibre7">Too weak, too young, but perhaps you will do.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The voice felt ancient&mdash;cold and heavy. It wrapped around me like sheets of
            lead.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">They have misled you, boy,</i> it said. <i class="calibre7">Barter
              with me. I will give you what you want.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">A shimmering image hovered over the void: my mother, frozen at the moment she‚Äôd
            dissolved in a shower of gold. Her face was distorted with pain, as if the Minotaur were still
            squeezing her neck. Her eyes looked directly at me, pleading: <i class="calibre7">Go!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to cry out, but my voice wouldn‚Äôt work.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cold laughter echoed from the chasm.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre17">An invisible force pulled me forward. It would drag me into
            the pit unless I stood firm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Help me rise, boy.</i> The voice became hungrier. <i
              class="calibre7">Bring me the bolt. Strike a blow against the treacherous gods!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The spirits of the dead whispered around me, <i class="calibre7">No! Wake!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The image of my mother began to fade. The thing in the pit tightened its unseen
            grip around me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I realized it wasn‚Äôt interested in pulling me in. It was using me to pull itself <i
              class="calibre7">out</i>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Good</i>, it murmured. <i class="calibre7">Good</i>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Wake!</i> the dead whispered. <i class="calibre7">Wake!</i></p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Someone was shaking me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My eyes opened, and it was daylight.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Annabeth said, ‚Äúthe zombie lives.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was trembling from the dream. I could still feel the grip of the chasm monster
            around my chest. ‚ÄúHow long was I asleep?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLong enough for me to cook breakfast.‚Äù Annabeth tossed me a bag of nacho-flavored
            corn chips from Aunty Em‚Äôs snack bar. ‚ÄúAnd Grover went exploring. Look, he found a friend.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My eyes had trouble focusing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was sitting cross-legged on a blanket with something fuzzy in his lap, a
            dirty, unnaturally pink stuffed animal.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">No. It wasn‚Äôt a stuffed animal. It was a pink poodle.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The poodle yapped at me suspiciously. Grover said, ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I blinked. ‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶talking to that thing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The poodle growled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis <i class="calibre7">thing</i>,‚Äù Grover warned, ‚Äúis our ticket west. Be nice
            to him.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou can talk to animals?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover ignored the question. ‚ÄúPercy, meet Gladiola. Gladiola, Percy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at Annabeth, figuring she‚Äôd crack up at this practical joke they were
            playing on me, but she looked deadly serious.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying hello to a pink poodle,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúForget it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúI said hello to the poodle. You say hello to the poodle.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">The poodle growled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said hello to the poodle.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover explained that he‚Äôd come across Gladiola in the woods and they‚Äôd struck up a
            conversation. The poodle had run away from a rich local family, who‚Äôd posted a $200 reward for his
            return. Gladiola didn‚Äôt really want to go back to his family, but he was willing to if it meant
            helping Grover.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-211" class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow does Gladiola know about the reward?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe read the signs,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúDuh.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSilly me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo we turn in Gladiola,‚Äù Annabeth explained in her best strategy voice, ‚Äúwe get
            money, and we buy tickets to Los Angeles. Simple.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about my dream&mdash;the whispering voices of the dead, the thing in the
            chasm, and my mother‚Äôs face, shimmering as it dissolved into gold. All that might be waiting for me
            in the West.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot another bus,‚Äù I said warily.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Annabeth agreed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She pointed downhill, toward train tracks I hadn‚Äôt been able to see last night in
            the dark. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an Amtrak station half a mile that way. According to Gladiola, the westbound
            train leaves at noon.‚Äù</p>

          <p class="calibre17">We weren‚Äôt attacked once, but I didn‚Äôt relax. I felt that we were traveling around
            in a display case, being watched from above and maybe from below, that something was waiting for the
            right opportunity.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to keep a low profile because my name and picture were splattered over the
            front pages of several East Coast newspapers. The <i class="calibre7">Trenton Register-News</i>
            showed a photo taken by a tourist as I got off the Greyhound bus. I had a wild look in my eyes. My
            sword was a metallic blur in my hands. It might‚Äôve been a baseball bat or a lacrosse stick.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The picture‚Äôs caption read:</p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre6">Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson, wanted for questioning in the Long</p>
          <p class="calibre6">Island disappearance of his mother two weeks ago, is shown here</p>
          <p class="calibre6">fleeing from the bus where he accosted several elderly female</p>
          <p class="calibre6">passengers. The bus exploded on an east New Jersey roadside shortly</p>
          <p class="calibre6">after Jackson fled the scene. Based on eyewitness accounts, police</p>
          <p class="calibre6">believe the boy may be traveling with two teenage accomplices. His</p>
          <p class="calibre6">stepfather, Gabe Ugliano, has offered a cash reward for information</p>
          <p class="calibre6">leading to his capture.</p>
          <br>
          <p id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù Annabeth told me. ‚ÄúMortal police could never
            find us.‚Äù But she didn‚Äôt sound so sure.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The rest of the day I spent alternately pacing the length of the train (because I
            had a really hard time sitting still) or looking out the windows.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Once, I spotted a family of centaurs galloping across a wheat field, bows at the
            ready, as they hunted lunch. The little boy centaur, who was the size of a second-grader on a pony,
            caught my eye and waved. I looked around the passenger car, but nobody else had noticed. The adult
            riders all had their faces buried in laptop computers or magazines.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Another time, toward evening, I saw something huge moving through the woods. I
            could‚Äôve sworn it was a lion, except that lions don‚Äôt live wild in America, and this thing was the
            size of a Hummer. Its fur glinted gold in the evening light. Then it leaped through the trees and
            was gone.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Our reward money for returning Gladiola the poodle had only been enough to purchase
            tickets as far as Denver. We couldn‚Äôt get berths in the sleeper car, so we dozed in our seats. My
            neck got stiff. I tried not to drool in my sleep, since Annabeth was sitting right next to me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover kept snoring and bleating and waking me up. Once, he shuffled around and his
            fake foot fell off. Annabeth and I had to stick it back on before any of the other passengers
            noticed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Annabeth asked me, once we‚Äôd gotten Grover‚Äôs sneaker readjusted. ‚ÄúWho wants
            your help?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhen you were asleep just now, you mumbled, ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt help you.‚Äô Who were you
            dreaming about?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was reluctant to say anything. It was the second time I‚Äôd dreamed about the evil
            voice from the pit. But it bothered me so much I finally told her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth was quiet for a long time. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound like Hades. He always
            appears on a black throne, and he never laughs.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe offered my mother in trade. Who else could do that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶if he meant, ‚ÄòHelp me rise from the Underworld.‚Äô If he wants war with the
            Olympians. But why ask you to bring him the master bolt if he already has it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I shook my head, wishing I knew the answer. I thought about what Grover had told
            me, that the Furies on the bus seemed to have been looking for something.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-213" class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Where is it? Where?</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Maybe Grover sensed my emotions. He snorted in his sleep, muttered something about
            vegetables, and turned his head.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth readjusted his cap so it covered his horns. ‚ÄúPercy, you can‚Äôt barter with
            Hades. You know that, right? He‚Äôs deceitful, heartless, and greedy. I don‚Äôt care if his Kindly Ones
            weren‚Äôt as aggressive this time&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis time?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou mean you‚Äôve run into them before?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her hand crept up to her necklace. She fingered a glazed white bead painted with
            the image of a pine tree, one of her clay end-of-summer tokens. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve got no love for
            the Lord of the Dead. You can‚Äôt be tempted to make a deal for your mom.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat would you do if it was your dad?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs easy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd leave him to rot.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not serious?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth‚Äôs gray eyes fixed on me. She wore the same expression she‚Äôd worn in the
            woods at camp, the moment she drew her sword against the hellhound. ‚ÄúMy dad‚Äôs resented me since the
            day I was born, Percy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe never wanted a baby. When he got me, he asked Athena to take
            me back and raise me on Olympus because he was too busy with his work. She wasn‚Äôt happy about that.
            She told him heroes had to be raised by their mortal parent.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut how‚Ä¶I mean, I guess you weren‚Äôt born in a hospital‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI appeared on my father‚Äôs doorstep, in a golden cradle, carried down from Olympus
            by Zephyr the West Wind. You‚Äôd think my dad would remember that as a miracle, right? Like, maybe
            he‚Äôd take some digital photos or something. But he always talked about my arrival as if it were the
            most inconvenient thing that had ever happened to him. When I was five he got married and totally
            forgot about Athena. He got a ‚Äòregular‚Äô mortal wife, and had two ‚Äòregular‚Äô mortal kids, and tried to
            pretend I didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared out the train window. The lights of a sleeping town were drifting by. I
            wanted to make Annabeth feel better, but I didn‚Äôt know how.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy mom married a really awful guy,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúGrover said she did it to protect
            me, to hide me in the scent of a human family. Maybe that‚Äôs what your dad was thinking.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth kept worrying at her necklace. She was pinching the gold college ring that
            hung with the beads. It occurred to me that the ring must be her father‚Äôs. I wondered why she wore
            it if she hated him so much.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt care about me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHis wife&mdash;my
            stepmom&mdash;treated me like a freak. She wouldn‚Äôt let me play with her children. My dad went along
            with her. Whenever something dangerous happened&mdash;you know, something with monsters&mdash;they
            would both look at me resentfully, like, ‚ÄòHow dare you put our family at risk.‚Äô Finally, I took the
            hint. I wasn‚Äôt wanted. I ran away.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow old were you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSame age as when I started camp. Seven.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶you couldn‚Äôt have gotten all the way to Half-Blood Hill by yourself.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot alone, no. Athena watched over me, guided me toward help. I made a couple of
            unexpected friends who took care of me, for a short time, anyway.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to ask what happened, but Annabeth seemed lost in sad memories. So I
            listened to the sound of Grover snoring and gazed out the train windows as the dark fields of Ohio
            raced by.</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1">Toward the end of our second day on the train, June 13, eight days before the summer
            solstice, we passed through some golden hills and over the Mississippi River into St. Louis.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth craned her neck to see the Gateway Arch, which looked to me like a huge
            shopping bag handle stuck on the city.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI want to do that,‚Äù she sighed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBuild something like that. You ever see the Parthenon, Percy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOnly in pictures.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomeday, I‚Äôm going to see it in person. I‚Äôm going to build the greatest monument
            to the gods, ever. Something that‚Äôll last a thousand years.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I laughed. ‚ÄúYou? An architect?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I don‚Äôt know why, but I found it funny. Just the idea of Annabeth trying to sit
            quietly and draw all day.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her cheeks flushed. ‚ÄúYes, an architect. Athena expects her children to create
            things, not just tear them down, like a certain god of earthquakes I could mention.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I watched the churning brown water of the Mississippi below.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúThat was mean.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-215" class="calibre17">‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we work together a little?‚Äù I pleaded. ‚ÄúI mean, didn‚Äôt
            Athena and Poseidon ever cooperate?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth had to think about it. ‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶the chariot,‚Äù she said tentatively. ‚ÄúMy
            mom invented it, but Poseidon created horses out of the crests of waves. So they had to work
            together to make it complete.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen we can cooperate, too. Right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We rode into the city, Annabeth watching as the Arch disappeared behind a hotel.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI suppose,‚Äù she said at last.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We pulled into the Amtrak station downtown. The intercom told us we‚Äôd have a
            three-hour layover before departing for Denver.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover stretched. Before he was even fully awake, he said, ‚ÄúFood.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on, goat boy,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúSightseeing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSightseeing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Gateway Arch,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis may be my only chance to ride to the top. Are
            you coming or not?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and I exchanged looks.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to say no, but I figured that if Annabeth was going, we couldn‚Äôt very well
            let her go alone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shrugged. ‚ÄúAs long as there‚Äôs a snack bar without monsters.‚Äù</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The Arch was about a mile from the train station. Late in the day, the lines to get
            in weren‚Äôt that long. We threaded our way through the underground museum, looking at covered wagons
            and other junk from the 1800s. It wasn‚Äôt all that thrilling, but Annabeth kept telling us
            interesting facts about how the Arch was built, and Grover kept passing me jelly beans, so I was
            okay.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I kept looking around, though, at the other people in line. ‚ÄúYou smell anything?‚Äù I
            murmured to Grover.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He took his nose out of the jelly-bean bag long enough to sniff. ‚ÄúUnderground,‚Äù he
            said distastefully. ‚ÄúUnderground air always smells like monsters. Probably doesn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">But something felt wrong to me. I had a feeling we shouldn‚Äôt be here.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGuys,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou know the gods‚Äô symbols of power?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth had been in the middle of reading about the construction equipment used to
            build the Arch, but she looked over. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, Hade&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre17">Grover cleared his throat. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a public place‚Ä¶You mean,
            our friend downstairs?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm, right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOur friend <i class="calibre7">way</i> downstairs. Doesn‚Äôt he
            have a hat like Annabeth‚Äôs?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou mean the Helm of Darkness,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs his symbol of power.
            I saw it next to his seat during the winter solstice council meeting.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe was there?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only time he‚Äôs allowed to visit Olympus&mdash;the darkest day
            of the year. But his helm is a lot more powerful than my invisibility hat, if what I‚Äôve heard is
            true‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt allows him to become darkness,‚Äù Grover confirmed. ‚ÄúHe can melt into shadow or
            pass through walls. He can‚Äôt be touched, or seen, or heard. And he can radiate fear so intense it
            can drive you insane or stop your heart. Why do you think all rational creatures fear the dark?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut then‚Ä¶how do we know he‚Äôs not here right now, watching us?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover exchanged looks.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt,‚Äù Grover said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThanks, that makes me feel a lot better,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGot any blue jelly beans left?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôd almost mastered my jumpy nerves when I saw the tiny little elevator car we were
            going to ride to the top of the Arch, and I knew I was in trouble. I hate confined places. They make
            me nuts.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We got shoehorned into the car with this big fat lady and her dog, a Chihuahua with
            a rhinestone collar. I figured maybe the dog was a seeing-eye Chihuahua, because none of the guards
            said a word about it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We started going up, inside the Arch. I‚Äôd never been in an elevator that went in a
            curve, and my stomach wasn‚Äôt too happy about it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo parents?‚Äù the fat lady asked us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She had beady eyes; pointy, coffee-stained teeth; a floppy denim hat, and a denim
            dress that bulged so much, she looked like a blue-jean blimp.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre below,‚Äù Annabeth told her. ‚ÄúScared of heights.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, the poor darlings.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Chihuahua growled. The woman said, ‚ÄúNow, now, sonny. Behave.‚Äù The dog had beady
            eyes like its owner, intelligent and vicious.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúSonny. Is that his name?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-217" class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the lady told me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She smiled, as if that cleared everything up.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">At the top of the Arch, the observation deck reminded me of a tin can with
            carpeting. Rows of tiny windows looked out over the city on one side and the river on the other. The
            view was okay, but if there‚Äôs anything I like less than a confined space, it‚Äôs a confined space six
            hundred feet in the air. I was ready to go pretty quick.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth kept talking about structural supports, and how she would‚Äôve made the
            windows bigger, and designed a see-through floor. She probably could‚Äôve stayed up there for hours,
            but luckily for me the park ranger announced that the observation deck would be closing in a few
            minutes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I steered Grover and Annabeth toward the exit, loaded them into the elevator, and I
            was about to get in myself when I realized there were already two other tourists inside. No room for
            me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The park ranger said, ‚ÄúNext car, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get out,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll wait with you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But that was going to mess everybody up and take even more time, so I said, ‚ÄúNaw,
            it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll see you guys at the bottom.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and Annabeth both looked nervous, but they let the elevator door slide shut.
            Their car disappeared down the ramp.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Now the only people left on the observation deck were me, a little boy with his
            parents, the park ranger, and the fat lady with her Chihuahua.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I smiled uneasily at the fat lady. She smiled back, her forked tongue flickering
            between her teeth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Wait a minute.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Forked tongue?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before I could decide if I‚Äôd really seen that, her Chihuahua jumped down and
            started yapping at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNow, now, sonny,‚Äù the lady said. ‚ÄúDoes this look like a good time? We have all
            these nice people here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDoggie!‚Äù said the little boy. ‚ÄúLook, a doggie!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His parents pulled him back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Chihuahua bared his teeth at me, foam dripping from his black lips.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, son,‚Äù the fat lady sighed. ‚ÄúIf you insist.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ice started forming in my stomach. ‚ÄúUm, did you just call that Chihuahua your son?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">Chimera</i>, dear,‚Äù the fat lady
            corrected. ‚ÄúNot a Chihuahua. It‚Äôs an easy mistake to make.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She rolled up her denim sleeves, revealing that the skin of her arms was scaly and
            green. When she smiled, I saw that her teeth were fangs. The pupils of her eyes were sideways slits,
            like a reptile‚Äôs.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Chihuahua barked louder, and with each bark, it grew. First to the size of a
            Doberman, then to a lion. The bark became a roar.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The little boy screamed. His parents pulled him back toward the exit, straight into
            the park ranger, who stood, paralyzed, gaping at the monster.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Chimera was now so tall its back rubbed against the roof. It had the head of a
            lion with a blood-caked mane, the body and hooves of a giant goat, and a serpent for a tail, a
            ten-foot-long diamondback growing right out of its shaggy behind. The rhinestone dog collar still
            hung around its neck, and the plate-sized dog tag was now easy to read: <span
              class="calibre5">CHIMERA&mdash;RABID, FIRE-BREATHING,</span> <span class="calibre5">POISONOUS&mdash;IF
              FOUND, PLEASE CALL TARTARUS&mdash;EXT. 954.</span></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I realized I hadn‚Äôt even uncapped my sword. My hands were numb. I was ten feet away
            from the Chimera‚Äôs bloody maw, and I knew that as soon as I moved, the creature would lunge.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The snake lady made a hissing noise that might‚Äôve been laughter. ‚ÄúBe honored, Percy
            Jackson. Lord Zeus rarely allows me to test a hero with one of my brood. For I am the Mother of
            Monsters, the terrible Echidna!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at her. All I could think to say was: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a kind of anteater?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She howled, her reptilian face turning brown and green with rage. ‚ÄúI hate it when
            people say that! I hate Australia! Naming that ridiculous animal after me. For that, Percy Jackson,
            my son shall destroy you!‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre17">The Chimera charged, its lion teeth gnashing. I managed to
            leap aside and dodge the bite.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I ended up next to the family and the park ranger, who were all screaming now,
            trying to pry open the emergency exit doors.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt let them get hurt. I uncapped my sword, ran to the other side of the
            deck, and yelled, ‚ÄúHey, Chihuahua!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Chimera turned faster than I would‚Äôve thought possible.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before I could swing my sword, it opened its mouth, emitting a stench like the
            world‚Äôs largest barbecue pit, and shot a column of flame straight at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I dove through the explosion. The carpet burst into flames; the heat was so
            intense, it nearly seared off my eyebrows.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Where I had been standing a moment before was a ragged hole in the side of the
            Arch, with melted metal steaming around the edges.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Great, I thought. We just blowtorched a national monument.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Riptide was now a shining bronze blade in my hands, and as the Chimera turned, I
            slashed at its neck.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That was my fatal mistake. The blade sparked harmlessly off the dog collar. I tried
            to regain my balance, but I was so worried about defending myself against the fiery lion‚Äôs mouth, I
            completely forgot about the serpent tail until it whipped around and sank its fangs into my calf.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">My whole leg was on fire. I tried to jab Riptide into the Chimera‚Äôs mouth, but the
            serpent tail wrapped around my ankles and pulled me off balance, and my blade flew out of my hand,
            spinning out of the hole in the Arch and down toward the Mississippi River.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I managed to get to my feet, but I knew I had lost. I was weaponless. I could feel
            deadly poison racing up to my chest. I remembered Chiron saying that Anaklusmos would always return
            to me, but there was no pen in my pocket. Maybe it had fallen too far away. Maybe it only returned
            when it was in pen form. I didn‚Äôt know, and I wasn‚Äôt going to live long enough to figure it out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I backed into the hole in the wall. The Chimera advanced, growling, smoke curling
            from its lips. The snake lady, Echidna, cackled. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt make heroes like they used to, eh,
            son?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The monster growled. It seemed in no hurry to finish me off now that I was beaten.
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre17">I glanced at the park ranger and the family. The little boy
            was hiding behind his father‚Äôs legs. I had to protect these people. I couldn‚Äôt just‚Ä¶die. I tried to
            think, but my whole body was on fire. My head felt dizzy. I had no sword. I was facing a massive,
            fire-breathing monster and its mother. And I was scared.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was no place else to go, so I stepped to the edge of the hole. Far, far
            below, the river glittered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">If I died, would the monsters go away? Would they leave the humans alone?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf you are the son of Poseidon,‚Äù Echidna hissed, ‚Äúyou would not fear water. Jump,
            Percy Jackson. Show me that water will not harm you. Jump and retrieve your sword. Prove your
            bloodline.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Yeah, right, I thought. I‚Äôd read somewhere that jumping into water from a couple of
            stories up was like jumping onto solid asphalt. From here, I‚Äôd splatter on impact.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Chimera‚Äôs mouth glowed red, heating up for another blast.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou have no faith,‚Äù Echidna told me. ‚ÄúYou do not trust the gods. I cannot blame
            you, little coward. Better you die now. The gods are faithless. The poison is in your heart.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She was right: I was dying. I could feel my breath slowing down. Nobody could save
            me, not even the gods.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I backed up and looked down at the water. I remembered the warm glow of my father‚Äôs
            smile when I was a baby. He must have seen me. He must have visited me when I was in my cradle.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I remembered the swirling green trident that had appeared above my head the night
            of capture the flag, when Poseidon had claimed me as his son.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But this wasn‚Äôt the sea. This was the Mississippi, dead center of the USA. There
            was no Sea God here.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDie, faithless one,‚Äù Echidna rasped, and the Chimera sent a column of flame toward
            my face.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFather, help me,‚Äù I prayed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned and jumped. My clothes on fire, poison coursing through my veins, I
            plummeted toward the river.</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 14: I BECOME A KNOWN FUGITIVE</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">I</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">‚ÄôD LOVE TO TELL
              YOU</span> I <span class="calibre5">HAD SOME DEEP</span> revelation on my way down, that I came
            to terms with my own mortality, laughed in the face of death, et cetera.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The truth? My only thought was: Aaaaggghhh!</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The river raced toward me at the speed of a truck. Wind ripped the breath from my
            lungs. Steeples and skyscrapers and bridges tumbled in and out of my vision.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">And then: <i class="calibre7">Flaaa-booom!</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">A whiteout of bubbles. I sank through the murk, sure that I was about to end up
            embedded in a hundred feet of mud and lost forever.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But my impact with the water hadn‚Äôt hurt. I was falling slowly now, bubbles
            trickling up through my fingers. I settled on the river bottom soundlessly. A catfish the size of my
            stepfather lurched away into the gloom. Clouds of silt and disgusting garbage&mdash;beer bottles,
            old shoes, plastic bags &mdash;swirled up all around me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">At that point, I realized a few things: first, I had not been flattened into a
            pancake. I had not been barbecued. I couldn‚Äôt even feel the Chimera poison boiling in my veins
            anymore. I was alive, which was good.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-223" class="calibre17">Second realization: I wasn‚Äôt wet. I mean, I could feel the
            coolness of the water. I could see where the fire on my clothes had been quenched. But when I
            touched my own shirt, it felt perfectly dry.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at the garbage floating by and snatched an old cigarette lighter.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">No way, I thought.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I flicked the lighter. It sparked. A tiny flame appeared, right there at the bottom
            of the Mississippi.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I grabbed a soggy hamburger wrapper out of the current and immediately the paper
            turned dry. I lit it with no problem. As soon as I let it go, the flames sputtered out. The wrapper
            turned back into a slimy rag. Weird.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But the strangest thought occurred to me only last: I was breathing. I was
            underwater, and I was breathing normally.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stood up, thigh-deep in mud. My legs felt shaky. My hands trembled. I should‚Äôve
            been dead. The fact that I wasn‚Äôt seemed like‚Ä¶well, a miracle. I imagined a woman‚Äôs voice, a voice
            that sounded a bit like my mother: <i class="calibre7">Percy, what do you say?</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶thanks.‚Äù Underwater, I sounded like I did on recordings, like a much older kid.
            ‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶Father.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">No response. Just the dark drift of garbage downriver, the enormous catfish gliding
            by, the flash of sunset on the water‚Äôs surface far above, turning everything the color of
            butterscotch.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Why had Poseidon saved me? The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. So
            I‚Äôd gotten lucky a few times before. Against a thing like the Chimera, I had never stood a chance.
            Those poor people in the Arch were probably toast. I couldn‚Äôt protect them. I was no hero. Maybe I
            should just stay down here with the catfish, join the bottom feeders.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Fump-fump-fump.</i> A riverboat‚Äôs paddlewheel churned above me,
            swirling the silt around.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There, not five feet in front of me, was my sword, its gleaming bronze hilt
            sticking up in the mud.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I heard that woman‚Äôs voice again: <i class="calibre7">Percy, take the sword. Your
              father believes in you.</i> This time, I knew the voice wasn‚Äôt in my head. I wasn‚Äôt imagining
            it. Her words seemed to come from everywhere, rippling through the water like dolphin sonar.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I called aloud.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then, through the gloom, I saw her&mdash;a woman the color of the water, a ghost in
            the current, floating just above the sword. She had long billowing hair, and her eyes, barely
            visible, were green like mine.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre17">A lump formed in my throat. I said, ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">No, child, only a messenger, though your mother‚Äôs fate is not
              as hopeless as you believe. Go to the beach in Santa Monica.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">It is your father‚Äôs will. Before you descend into the
              Underworld, you must go to Santa Monica. Please, Percy, I cannot stay long. The river here is
              too foul for my presence.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù I was sure this woman was my mother, or a vision of her, anyway.
            ‚ÄúWho&mdash;how did you&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was so much I wanted to ask, the words jammed up my throat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">I cannot stay, brave one,</i> the woman said. She reached out,
            and I felt the current brush my face like a caress. <i class="calibre7">You must go to Santa Monica!
              And, Percy, do not trust the gifts‚Ä¶.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her voice faded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGifts?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat gifts? Wait!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She made one more attempt to speak, but the sound was gone. Her image melted away.
            If it was my mother, I had lost her again.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I felt like drowning myself. The only problem: I was immune to drowning.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Your father believes in you,</i> she had said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She‚Äôd also called me brave‚Ä¶unless she was talking to the catfish.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I waded toward Riptide and grabbed it by the hilt. The Chimera might still be up
            there with its snaky, fat mother, waiting to finish me off. At the very least, the mortal police
            would be arriving, trying to figure out who had blown a hole in the Arch. If they found me, they‚Äôd
            have some questions.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I capped my sword, stuck the ballpoint pen in my pocket. ‚ÄúThank you, Father,‚Äù I
            said again to the dark water.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I kicked up through the muck and swam for the surface.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1">I came ashore next to a floating McDonald‚Äôs.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A block away, every emergency vehicle in St. Louis was surrounding the Arch. Police
            helicopters circled overhead. The crowd of onlookers reminded me of Times Square on New Year‚Äôs Eve.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">A little girl said, ‚ÄúMama! That boy walked out of the river.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice, dear,‚Äù her mother said, craning her neck to watch the ambulances.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs dry!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice, dear.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A news lady was talking for the camera: ‚ÄúProbably not a terrorist attack, we‚Äôre
            told, but it‚Äôs still very early in the investigation. The damage, as you can see, is very serious.
            We‚Äôre trying to get some of the survivors, to question them about eyewitness reports of someone
            falling from the Arch.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Survivors.</i> I felt a surge of relief. Maybe the park ranger
            and that family made it out safely. I hoped Annabeth and Grover were okay.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to push through the crowd to see what was going on inside the police line.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú‚Ä¶an adolescent boy,‚Äù another reporter was saying. ‚ÄúChannel Five has learned that
            surveillance cameras show an adolescent boy going wild on the observation deck, somehow setting off
            this freak explosion. Hard to believe, John, but that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre hearing. Again, no confirmed
            fatalities‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I backed away, trying to keep my head down. I had to go a long way around the
            police perimeter. Uniformed officers and news reporters were everywhere.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôd almost lost hope of ever finding Annabeth and Grover when a familiar voice
            bleated, ‚ÄúPerrr-cy!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned and got tackled by Grover‚Äôs bear hug&mdash;or goat hug. He said, ‚ÄúWe
            thought you‚Äôd gone to Hades the hard way!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth stood behind him, trying to look angry, but even she seemed relieved to
            see me. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt leave you alone for five minutes! What happened?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI sort of fell.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy! Six hundred and thirty feet?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Behind us, a cop shouted, ‚ÄúGangway!‚Äù The crowd parted and a couple of paramedics
            hustled out, rolling a woman on a stretcher. I recognized her immediately as the mother of the
            little boy who‚Äôd been on the observation deck. She was saying, ‚ÄúAnd then this huge dog, this huge
            fire-breathing Chihuahua&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù the paramedic said. ‚ÄúJust calm down. Your
            family is fine. The medication is starting to kick in.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy! This boy jumped out of the hole and the monster disappeared.‚Äù Then
            she saw me. ‚ÄúThere he is! That‚Äôs the boy!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned quickly and pulled Annabeth and Grover after me. We disappeared into the
            crowd.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Annabeth demanded. ‚ÄúWas she talking about the Chihuahua on the
            elevator?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I told them the whole story of the Chimera, Echidna, my high-dive act, and the
            underwater lady‚Äôs message.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù said Grover. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get you to Santa Monica! You can‚Äôt ignore a
            summons from your dad.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before Annabeth could respond, we passed another reporter doing a news break, and I
            almost froze in my tracks when he said, ‚ÄúPercy Jackson. That‚Äôs right, Dan. Channel Twelve has
            learned that the boy who may have caused this explosion fits the description of a young man wanted
            by authorities for a serious New Jersey bus accident three days ago. <i class="calibre7">And</i> the
            boy is believed to be traveling west. For our viewers at home, here is a photo of Percy Jackson.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">We ducked around the news van and slipped into an alley.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFirst things first,‚Äù I told Grover. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get out of town!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Somehow, we made it back to the Amtrak station without getting spotted. We got on
            board the train just before it pulled out for Denver. The train trundled west as darkness fell,
            police lights still pulsing against the St. Louis skyline behind us.</p>

              AFTERNOON,</span> J<span class="calibre5">UNE 14,</span> seven days before the solstice, our
            train rolled into Denver. We hadn‚Äôt eaten since the night before in the dining car, somewhere in
            Kansas. We hadn‚Äôt taken a shower since Half-Blood Hill, and I was sure that was obvious.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try to contact Chiron,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúI want to tell him about your talk
            with the river spirit.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt use phones, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about phones.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We wandered through downtown for about half an hour, though I wasn‚Äôt sure what
            Annabeth was looking for. The air was dry and hot, which felt weird after the humidity of St. Louis.
            Everywhere we turned, the Rocky Mountains seemed to be staring at me, like a tidal wave about to
            crash into the city.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally we found an empty do-it-yourself car wash. We veered toward the stall
            farthest from the street, keeping our eyes open for patrol cars. We were three adolescents hanging
            out at a car wash without a car; any cop worth his doughnuts would figure we were up to no good.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat exactly are we doing?‚Äù I asked, as Grover took out the spray gun.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs seventy-five cents,‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve only got two
            quarters left. Annabeth?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe dining car wiped me out.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I fished out my last bit of change and passed Grover a quarter, which left me two
            nickels and one drachma from Medusa‚Äôs place.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúWe could do it with a spray bottle, of course, but the
            connection isn‚Äôt as good, and my arm gets tired of pumping.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He fed in the quarters and set the knob to <span class="calibre5">FINE MIST</span>.
            ‚ÄúI-M‚Äôing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúInstant messaging?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">Iris</i>-messaging,‚Äù Annabeth corrected. ‚ÄúThe rainbow goddess
            Iris carries messages for the gods. If you know how to ask, and she‚Äôs not too busy, she‚Äôll do the
            same for half-bloods.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou summon the goddess with a spray gun?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover pointed the nozzle in the air and water hissed out in a thick white mist.
            ‚ÄúUnless you know an easier way to make a rainbow.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Sure enough, late afternoon light filtered through the vapor and broke into colors.
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-231" class="calibre17">Annabeth held her palm out to me. ‚ÄúDrachma, please.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I handed it over.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She raised the coin over her head. ‚ÄúO goddess, accept our offering.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She threw the drachma into the rainbow. It disappeared in a golden shimmer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHalf-Blood Hill,‚Äù Annabeth requested.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For a moment, nothing happened.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I was looking through the mist at strawberry fields, and the Long Island Sound
            in the distance. We seemed to be on the porch of the Big House. Standing with his back to us at the
            railing was a sandy-haired guy in shorts and an orange tank top. He was holding a bronze sword and
            seemed to be staring intently at something down in the meadow.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLuke!‚Äù I called.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He turned, eyes wide. I could swear he was standing three feet in front of me
            through a screen of mist, except I could only see the part of him that appeared in the rainbow.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy!‚Äù His scarred face broke into a grin. ‚ÄúIs that Annabeth, too? Thank the
            gods! Are you guys okay?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶fine,‚Äù Annabeth stammered. She was madly straightening her dirty T-shirt,
            trying to comb the loose hair out of her face. ‚ÄúWe thought &mdash;Chiron&mdash;I mean&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs down at the cabins.‚Äù Luke‚Äôs smile faded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having some issues with the
            campers. Listen, is everything cool with you? Is Grover all right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here,‚Äù Grover called. He held the nozzle out to one side and stepped
            into Luke‚Äôs line of vision. ‚ÄúWhat kind of issues?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Just then a big Lincoln Continental pulled into the car wash with its stereo turned
            to maximum hip-hop. As the car slid into the next stall, the bass from the subwoofers vibrated so
            much, it shook the pavement.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúChiron had to&mdash;what‚Äôs that noise?‚Äù Luke yelled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of it!‚Äù Annabeth yelled back, looking very relieved to have an
            excuse to get out of sight. ‚ÄúGrover, come on!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGive Percy the nozzle and come on!‚Äù she ordered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover muttered something about girls being harder to understand than the Oracle at
            Delphi, then he handed me the spray gun and followed Annabeth.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre17">I readjusted the hose so I could keep the rainbow going and
            still see Luke.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúChiron had to break up a fight,‚Äù Luke shouted to me over the music. ‚ÄúThings are
            pretty tense here, Percy. Word leaked out about the Zeus&ndash; Poseidon standoff. We‚Äôre still not
            sure how&mdash;probably the same scumbag who summoned the hellhound. Now the campers are starting to
            take sides. It‚Äôs shaping up like the Trojan War all over again. Aphrodite, Ares, and Apollo are
            backing Poseidon, more or less. Athena is backing Zeus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I shuddered to think that Clarisse‚Äôs cabin would ever be on my dad‚Äôs side for
            anything. In the next stall, I heard Annabeth and some guy arguing with each other, then the music‚Äôs
            volume decreased drastically.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs your status?‚Äù Luke asked me. ‚ÄúChiron will be sorry he missed you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I told him pretty much everything, including my dreams. It felt so good to see him,
            to feel like I was back at camp even for a few minutes, that I didn‚Äôt realize how long I had talked
            until the beeper went off on the spray machine, and I realized I only had one more minute before the
            water shut off.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI wish I could be there,‚Äù Luke told me. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt help much from here, I‚Äôm afraid,
            but listen‚Ä¶it had to be Hades who took the master bolt. He was there at Olympus at the winter
            solstice. I was chaperoning a field trip and we saw him.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut Chiron said the gods can‚Äôt take each other‚Äôs magic items directly.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true,‚Äù Luke said, looking troubled. ‚ÄúStill‚Ä¶Hades has the helm of darkness.
            How could anybody else sneak into the throne room and steal the master bolt? You‚Äôd have to be
            invisible.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We were both silent, until Luke seemed to realize what he‚Äôd said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, hey,‚Äù he protested. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean Annabeth. She and I have known each other
            forever. She would never‚Ä¶I mean, she‚Äôs like a little sister to me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wondered if Annabeth would like that description. In the stall next to us, the
            music stopped completely. A man screamed in terror, car doors slammed, and the Lincoln peeled out of
            the car wash.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better go see what that was,‚Äù Luke said. ‚ÄúListen, are you wearing the flying
            shoes? I‚Äôll feel better if I know they‚Äôve done you some good.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶uh, yeah!‚Äù I tried not to sound like a guilty liar. ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôve come in
            handy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù He grinned. ‚ÄúThey fit and everything?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-233" class="calibre17">The water shut off. The mist started to evaporate.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, take care of yourself out there in Denver,‚Äù Luke called, his voice getting
            fainter. ‚ÄúAnd tell Grover it‚Äôll be better this time! Nobody will get turned into a pine tree if he
            just&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But the mist was gone, and Luke‚Äôs image faded to nothing. I was alone in a wet,
            empty car wash stall.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover came around the corner, laughing, but stopped when they saw my
            face. Annabeth‚Äôs smile faded. ‚ÄúWhat happened, Percy? What did Luke say?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot much,‚Äù I lied, my stomach feeling as empty as a Big Three cabin. ‚ÄúCome on,
            let‚Äôs find some dinner.‚Äù</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">A few minutes later, we were sitting at a booth in a gleaming chrome diner. All
            around us, families were eating burgers and drinking malts and sodas.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally the waitress came over. She raised her eyebrow skeptically. ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúWe, um, want to order dinner.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou kids have money to pay for it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover‚Äôs lower lip quivered. I was afraid he would start bleating, or worse, start
            eating the linoleum. Annabeth looked ready to pass out from hunger.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was trying to think up a sob story for the waitress when a rumble shook the whole
            building; a motorcycle the size of a baby elephant had pulled up to the curb.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All conversation in the diner stopped. The motorcycle‚Äôs headlight glared red. Its
            gas tank had flames painted on it, and a shotgun holster riveted to either side, complete with
            shotguns. The seat was leather&mdash;but leather that looked like‚Ä¶well, Caucasian human skin.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The guy on the bike would‚Äôve made pro wrestlers run for Mama. He was dressed in a
            red muscle shirt and black jeans and a black leather duster, with a hunting knife strapped to his
            thigh. He wore red wraparound shades, and he had the cruelest, most brutal face I‚Äôd ever
            seen&mdash;handsome, I guess, but wicked&mdash;with an oily black crew cut and cheeks that were
            scarred from many, many fights. The weird thing was, I felt like I‚Äôd seen his face somewhere before.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">As he walked into the diner, a hot, dry wind blew through the place. All the people
            rose, as if they were hypnotized, but the biker waved his hand dismissively and they all sat down
            again. Everybody went back to their conversations. The waitress blinked, as if somebody had just
            pressed the rewind button on her brain. She asked us again, ‚ÄúYou kids have money to pay for it?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-234" class="calibre17">The biker said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on me.‚Äù He slid into our booth, which
            was way too small for him, and crowded Annabeth against the window.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He looked up at the waitress, who was gaping at him, and said, ‚ÄúAre you still
            here?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He pointed at her, and she stiffened. She turned as if she‚Äôd been spun around, then
            marched back toward the kitchen.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The biker looked at me. I couldn‚Äôt see his eyes behind the red shades, but bad
            feelings started boiling in my stomach. Anger, resentment, bitterness. I wanted to hit a wall. I
            wanted to pick a fight with somebody. Who did this guy think he was?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He gave me a wicked grin. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre old Seaweed‚Äôs kid, huh?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I should‚Äôve been surprised, or scared, but instead I felt like I was looking at my
            stepdad, Gabe. I wanted to rip this guy‚Äôs head off. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it to you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth‚Äôs eyes flashed me a warning. ‚ÄúPercy, this is&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The biker raised his hand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúS‚Äôokay,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind a little attitude. Long as you remember who‚Äôs the
            boss. You know who I am, little cousin?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then it struck me why this guy looked familiar. He had the same vicious sneer as
            some of the kids at Camp Half-Blood, the ones from cabin five.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Clarisse‚Äôs dad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAres, god of war.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares grinned and took off his shades. Where his eyes should‚Äôve been, there was only
            fire, empty sockets glowing with miniature nuclear explosions. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, punk. I heard you
            broke Clarisse‚Äôs spear.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShe was asking for it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúProbably. That‚Äôs cool. I don‚Äôt fight my kids‚Äô fights, you know? What I‚Äôm here
            for&mdash;I heard you were in town. I got a little proposition for you.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre17">The waitress came back with heaping trays of
            food&mdash;cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings, and chocolate shakes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares handed her a few gold drachmas.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She looked nervously at the coins. ‚ÄúBut, these aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares pulled out his huge knife and started cleaning his fingernails. ‚ÄúProblem,
            sweetheart?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The waitress swallowed, then left with the gold.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I told Ares. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just threaten people with a knife.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares laughed. ‚ÄúAre you kidding? I love this country. Best place since Sparta. Don‚Äôt
            you carry a weapon, punk? You should. Dangerous world out there. Which brings me to my proposition.
            I need you to do me a favor.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat favor could I do for a god?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomething a god doesn‚Äôt have time to do himself. It‚Äôs nothing much. I left my
            shield at an abandoned water park here in town. I was going on a little‚Ä¶date with my girlfriend. We
            were interrupted. I left my shield behind. I want you to fetch it for me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go back and get it yourself?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The fire in his eye sockets glowed a little hotter.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I turn you into a prairie dog and run you over with my Harley? Because I
            don‚Äôt feel like it. A god is giving you an opportunity to prove yourself, Percy Jackson. Will you
            prove yourself a coward?‚Äù He leaned forward. ‚ÄúOr maybe you only fight when there‚Äôs a river to dive
            into, so your daddy can protect you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to punch this guy, but somehow, I knew he was waiting for that. Ares‚Äôs
            power was causing my anger. He‚Äôd love it if I attacked. I didn‚Äôt want to give him the satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not interested,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already got a quest.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares‚Äôs fiery eyes made me see things I didn‚Äôt want to see&mdash;blood and smoke and
            corpses on the battlefield. ‚ÄúI know all about your quest, punk. When that <i class="calibre7">item</i> was
            first stolen, Zeus sent his best out looking for it: Apollo,
            Athena, Artemis, and me, naturally. If I couldn‚Äôt sniff out a weapon that powerful‚Ä¶‚Äù He licked his
            lips, as if the very thought of the master bolt made him hungry. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶if I couldn‚Äôt find it, you
            got no hope. Nevertheless, I‚Äôm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. Your dad and I go way
            back. After all, I‚Äôm the one who told him my suspicions about old Corpse Breath.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-237" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou told him Hades stole the bolt?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSure. Framing somebody to start a war. Oldest trick in the book. I recognized it
            immediately. In a way, you got me to thank for your little quest.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I grumbled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm a generous guy. Just do my little job, and I‚Äôll help you on your way.
            I‚Äôll arrange a ride west for you and your friends.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing fine on our own.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah, right. No money. No wheels. No clue what you‚Äôre up against. Help me out, and
            maybe I‚Äôll tell you something you need to know. Something about your mom.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMy mom?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He grinned. ‚ÄúThat got your attention. The water park is a mile west on Delancy. You
            can‚Äôt miss it. Look for the Tunnel of Love ride.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat interrupted your date?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúSomething scare you off?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares bared his teeth, but I‚Äôd seen his threatening look before on Clarisse. There
            was something false about it, almost like he was nervous.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you met me, punk, and not one of the other Olympians. They‚Äôre not as
            forgiving of rudeness as I am. I‚Äôll meet you back here when you‚Äôre done. Don‚Äôt disappoint me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After that I must have fainted, or fallen into a trance, because when I opened my
            eyes again, Ares was gone. I might‚Äôve thought the conversation had been a dream, but Annabeth‚Äôs and
            Grover‚Äôs expressions told me otherwise.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot good,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúAres sought you out, Percy. This is not good.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared out the window. The motorcycle had disappeared.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Did Ares really know something about my mom, or was he just playing with me? Now
            that he was gone, all the anger had drained out of me. I realized Ares must love to mess with
            people‚Äôs emotions. That was his power &mdash;cranking up the passions so badly, they clouded your
            ability to think.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably some kind of trick,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúForget Ares. Let‚Äôs just go.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúLook, I hate Ares as much as anybody, but you don‚Äôt
            ignore the gods unless you want serious bad fortune. He wasn‚Äôt kidding about turning you into a
            rodent.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked down at my cheeseburger, which suddenly didn‚Äôt seem so appetizing. ‚ÄúWhy
            does he need us?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre17">‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a problem that requires brains,‚Äù Annabeth said.
            ‚ÄúAres has strength. That‚Äôs all he has. Even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut this water park‚Ä¶he acted almost scared. What would make a war god run away
            like that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover glanced nervously at each other.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôll have to find out.‚Äù</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The sun was sinking behind the mountains by the time we found the water park.
            Judging from the sign, it once had been called <span class="calibre5">WATERLAND</span>, but now some
            of the letters were smashed out, so it read <span class="calibre5">WAT R A D</span>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The main gate was padlocked and topped with barbed wire. Inside, huge dry
            waterslides and tubes and pipes curled everywhere, leading to empty pools. Old tickets and
            advertisements fluttered around the asphalt. With night coming on, the place looked sad and creepy.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf Ares brings his girlfriend here for a date,‚Äù I said, staring up at the barbed
            wire, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd hate to see what she looks like.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Annabeth warned. ‚ÄúBe more respectful.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I thought you hated Ares.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still a god. And his girlfriend is very temperamental.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to insult her looks,‚Äù Grover added.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho is she? Echidna?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo, Aphrodite,‚Äù Grover said, a little dreamily. ‚ÄúGoddess of love.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI thought she was married to somebody,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHephaestus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your point?‚Äù he asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I suddenly felt the need to change the subject. ‚ÄúSo how do we get in?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúMaia!</i>‚Äù Grover‚Äôs shoes sprouted wings.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He flew over the fence, did an unintended somersault in midair, then stumbled to a
            landing on the opposite side. He dusted off his jeans, as if he‚Äôd planned the whole thing. ‚ÄúYou guys
            coming?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and I had to climb the old-fashioned way, holding down the barbed wire for
            each other as we crawled over the top.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The shadows grew long as we walked through the park, checking out the attractions.
            There was Ankle Biter Island, Head Over Wedgie, and Dude, Where‚Äôs My Swimsuit?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">No monsters came to get us. Nothing made the slightest noise.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-239" class="calibre17">We found a souvenir shop that had been left open. Merchandise
            still lined the shelves: snow globes, pencils, postcards, and racks of&mdash;</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúClothes,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúFresh clothes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt just&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWatch me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She snatched an entire row of stuff off the racks and disappeared into the changing
            room. A few minutes later she came out in Waterland flower-print shorts, a big red Waterland
            T-shirt, and commemorative Waterland surf shoes. A Waterland backpack was slung over her shoulder,
            obviously stuffed with more goodies.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat the heck.‚Äù Grover shrugged. Soon, all three of us were decked out like
            walking advertisements for the defunct theme park.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We continued searching for the Tunnel of Love. I got the feeling that the whole
            park was holding its breath. ‚ÄúSo Ares and Aphrodite,‚Äù I said, to keep my mind off the growing dark,
            ‚Äúthey have a thing going?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs old gossip, Percy,‚Äù Annabeth told me. ‚ÄúThree-thousand-year-old gossip.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat about Aphrodite‚Äôs husband?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, you know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHephaestus. The blacksmith. He was crippled when he
            was a baby, thrown off Mount Olympus by Zeus. So he isn‚Äôt exactly handsome. Clever with his hands,
            and all, but Aphrodite isn‚Äôt into brains and talent, you know?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShe likes bikers.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHephaestus knows?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh sure,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúHe caught them together once. I mean, literally caught
            them, in a golden net, and invited all the gods to come and laugh at them. Hephaestus is always
            trying to embarrass them. That‚Äôs why they meet in out-of-the-way places, like‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She stopped, looking straight ahead. ‚ÄúLike that.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In front of us was an empty pool that would‚Äôve been awesome for skateboarding. It
            was at least fifty yards across and shaped like a bowl.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Around the rim, a dozen bronze statues of Cupid stood guard with wings spread and
            bows ready to fire. On the opposite side from us, a tunnel opened up, probably where the water
            flowed into when the pool was full. The sign above it read, <span class="calibre5">THRILL RIDE O‚Äô
              LOVE: THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENTS‚Äô TUNNEL OF</span> <span class="calibre5">LOVE</span> !</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-240" class="calibre17">Grover crept toward the edge. ‚ÄúGuys, look.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Marooned at the bottom of the pool was a pink-and-white two-seater boat with a
            canopy over the top and little hearts painted all over it. In the left seat, glinting in the fading
            light, was Ares‚Äôs shield, a polished circle of bronze.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis is too easy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSo we just walk down there and get it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth ran her fingers along the base of the nearest cupid statue.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Greek letter carved here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEta. I wonder‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou smell any monsters?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He sniffed the wind. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNothing&mdash;like, in-the-Arch-and-you-didn‚Äôt-smell-Echidna nothing, or really
            nothing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover looked hurt. ‚ÄúI told you, that was underground.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going down there.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with you.‚Äù Grover didn‚Äôt sound too enthusiastic, but I got the feeling he
            was trying to make up for what had happened in St. Louis.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúI want you to stay up top with the flying shoes. You‚Äôre the Red
            Baron, a flying ace, remember? I‚Äôll be counting on you for backup, in case something goes wrong.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover puffed up his chest a little. ‚ÄúSure. But what could go wrong?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Just a feeling. Annabeth, come with me&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAre you kidding?‚Äù She looked at me as if I‚Äôd just dropped from the moon. Her
            cheeks were bright red.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the problem now?‚Äù I demanded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMe, go with you to the‚Ä¶the ‚ÄòThrill Ride of Love‚Äô? How embarrassing is that? What
            if somebody saw me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to see you?‚Äù But my face was burning now, too. Leave it to a girl to
            make everything complicated. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it myself.‚Äù But when I started down the
            side of the pool, she followed me, muttering about how boys always messed things up.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We reached the boat. The shield was propped on one seat, and next to it was a
            lady‚Äôs silk scarf. I tried to imagine Ares and Aphrodite here, a couple of gods meeting in a
            junked-out amusement-park ride. Why? Then I noticed something I hadn‚Äôt seen from up top: mirrors all
            the way around the rim of the pool, facing this spot. We could see ourselves no matter which
            direction we looked. That must be it. While Ares and Aphrodite were smooching with each other they
            could look at their favorite people: themselves.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-241" class="calibre17">I picked up the scarf. It shimmered pink, and the perfume was
            indescribable&mdash;rose, or mountain laurel. Something good. I smiled, a little dreamy, and was
            about to rub the scarf against my cheek when Annabeth ripped it out of my hand and stuffed it in her
            pocket. ‚ÄúOh, no you don‚Äôt. Stay away from that love magic.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúJust get the shield, Seaweed Brain, and let‚Äôs get out of here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The moment I touched the shield, I knew we were in trouble. My hand broke through
            something that had been connecting it to the dashboard. A cobweb, I thought, but then I looked at a
            strand of it on my palm and saw it was some kind of metal filament, so fine it was almost invisible.
            A trip wire.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúToo late.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another Greek letter on the side of the boat, another Eta. This is a
            trap.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Noise erupted all around us, of a million gears grinding, as if the whole pool were
            turning into one giant machine.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover yelled, ‚ÄúGuys!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Up on the rim, the Cupid statues were drawing their bows into firing position.
            Before I could suggest taking cover, they shot, but not at us. They fired at each other, across the
            rim of the pool. Silky cables trailed from the arrows, arcing over the pool and anchoring where they
            landed to form a huge golden asterisk. Then smaller metallic threads started weaving together
            magically between the main strands, making a net.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-244" class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe have to get out,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDuh!‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I grabbed the shield and we ran, but going up the slope of the pool was not as easy
            as going down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù Grover shouted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was trying to hold open a section of the net for us, but wherever he touched it,
            the golden threads started to wrap around his hands.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Cupids‚Äô heads popped open. Out came video cameras. Spotlights rose up all
            around the pool, blinding us with illumination, and a loudspeaker voice boomed: ‚ÄúLive to Olympus in
            one minute‚Ä¶Fifty-nine seconds, fifty-eight‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHephaestus!‚Äù Annabeth screamed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so stupid! Eta is ‚ÄòH.‚Äô He made this trap to
            catch his wife with Ares. Now we‚Äôre going to be broadcast live to Olympus and look like absolute
            fools!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We‚Äôd almost made it to the rim when the row of mirrors opened like hatches and
            thousands of tiny metallic‚Ä¶things poured out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth screamed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was an army of wind-up creepy-crawlies: bronze-gear bodies, spindly legs, little
            pincer mouths, all scuttling toward us in a wave of clacking, whirring metal.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSpiders!‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúSp&mdash;sp&mdash;aaaah!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôd never seen her like this before. She fell backward in terror and almost got
            overwhelmed by the spider robots before I pulled her up and dragged her back toward the boat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The things were coming out from all around the rim now, millions of them, flooding
            toward the center of the pool, completely surrounding us. I told myself they probably weren‚Äôt
            programmed to kill, just corral us and bite us and make us look stupid. Then again, this was a trap
            meant for gods. And we weren‚Äôt gods.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-245" class="calibre17">Annabeth and I climbed into the boat. I started kicking away
            the spiders as they swarmed aboard. I yelled at Annabeth to help me, but she was too paralyzed to do
            much more than scream.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThirty, twenty-nine,‚Äù called the loudspeaker.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The spiders started spitting out strands of metal thread, trying to tie us down.
            The strands were easy enough to break at first, but there were so many of them, and the spiders just
            kept coming. I kicked one away from Annabeth‚Äôs leg and its pincers took a chunk out of my new surf
            shoe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover hovered above the pool in his flying sneakers, trying to pull the net loose,
            but it wouldn‚Äôt budge.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Think, I told myself. Think.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Tunnel of Love entrance was under the net. We could use it as an exit, except
            that it was blocked by a million robot spiders.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFifteen, fourteen,‚Äù the loudspeaker called.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Water, I thought. Where does the ride‚Äôs water come from?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I saw them: huge water pipes behind the mirrors, where the spiders had come
            from. And up above the net, next to one of the Cupids, a glass-windowed booth that must be the
            controller‚Äôs station.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover!‚Äù I yelled. ‚ÄúGet into that booth! Find the ‚Äòon‚Äô switch!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDo it!‚Äù It was a crazy hope, but it was our only chance. The spiders were all over
            the prow of the boat now. Annabeth was screaming her head off. I had to get us out of there.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was in the controller‚Äôs booth now, slamming away at the buttons.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFive, four&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover looked up at me hopelessly, raising his hands. He was letting me know that
            he‚Äôd pushed every button, but still nothing was happening.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I closed my eyes and thought about waves, rushing water, the Mississippi River. I
            felt a familiar tug in my gut. I tried to imagine that I was dragging the ocean all the way to
            Denver.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTwo, one, <i class="calibre7">zero</i>!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Water exploded out of the pipes. It roared into the pool, sweeping away the
            spiders. I pulled Annabeth into the seat next to me and fastened her seat belt just as the tidal
            wave slammed into our boat, over the top, whisking the spiders away and dousing us completely, but
            not capsizing us. The boat turned, lifted in the flood, and spun in circles around the whirlpool.
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-246" class="calibre17">The water was full of short-circuiting spiders, some of them
            smashing against the pool‚Äôs concrete wall with such force they burst.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Spotlights glared down at us. The Cupid-cams were rolling, live to Olympus.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But I could only concentrate on controlling the boat. I willed it to ride the
            current, to keep away from the wall. Maybe it was my imagination, but the boat seemed to respond. At
            least, it didn‚Äôt break into a million pieces. We spun around one last time, the water level now
            almost high enough to shred us against the metal net. Then the boat‚Äôs nose turned toward the tunnel
            and we rocketed through into the darkness.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and I held tight, both of us screaming as the boat shot curls and hugged
            corners and took forty-five-degree plunges past pictures of Romeo and Juliet and a bunch of other
            Valentine‚Äôs Day stuff.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then we were out of the tunnel, the night air whistling through our hair as the
            boat barreled straight toward the exit.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">If the ride had been in working order, we would‚Äôve sailed off a ramp between the
            golden Gates of Love and splashed down safely in the exit pool. But there was a problem. The Gates
            of Love were chained. Two boats that had been washed out of the tunnel before us were now piled
            against the barricade&mdash;one submerged, the other cracked in half.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUnfasten your seat belt,‚Äù I yelled to Annabeth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUnless you want to get smashed to death.‚Äù I strapped Ares‚Äôs shield to my arm.
            ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to jump for it.‚Äù My idea was simple and insane. As the boat struck, we would
            use its force like a springboard to jump the gate. I‚Äôd heard of people surviving car crashes that
            way, getting thrown thirty or forty feet away from an accident. With luck, we would land in the
            pool.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth seemed to understand. She gripped my hand as the gates got closer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOn my mark,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo! On my mark!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSimple physics!‚Äù she yelled. ‚ÄúForce times the trajectory angle&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFine!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúOn <i class="calibre7">your</i> mark!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She hesitated‚Ä¶hesitated‚Ä¶then yelled, ‚ÄúNow!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Crack!</i></p>
          <p id="calibre_link-247" class="calibre17">Annabeth was right. If we‚Äôd jumped when I thought we
            should‚Äôve, we would‚Äôve crashed into the gates. She got us maximum lift.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Unfortunately, that was a little more than we needed. Our boat smashed into the
            pileup and we were thrown into the air, straight over the gates, over the pool, and down toward
            solid asphalt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Something grabbed me from behind.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth yelled, ‚ÄúOuch!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover!</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In midair, he had grabbed me by the shirt, and Annabeth by the arm, and was trying
            to pull us out of a crash landing, but Annabeth and I had all the momentum.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too heavy!‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going down!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We spiraled toward the ground, Grover doing his best to slow the fall.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We smashed into a photo-board, Grover‚Äôs head going straight into the hole where
            tourists would put their faces, pretending to be Noo-Noo the Friendly Whale. Annabeth and I tumbled
            to the ground, banged up but alive. Ares‚Äôs shield was still on my arm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Once we caught our breath, Annabeth and I got Grover out of the photo-board and
            thanked him for saving our lives. I looked back at the Thrill Ride of Love. The water was subsiding.
            Our boat had been smashed to pieces against the gates.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-248" class="calibre17">A hundred yards away, at the entrance pool, the Cupids were
            still filming. The statues had swiveled so that their cameras were trained straight on us, the
            spotlights in our faces.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShow‚Äôs over!‚Äù I yelled. ‚ÄúThank you! Good night!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Cupids turned back to their original positions. The lights shut off. The park
            went quiet and dark again, except for the gentle trickle of water into the Thrill Ride of Love‚Äôs
            exit pool. I wondered if Olympus had gone to a commercial break, or if our ratings had been any
            good.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I hated being teased. I hated being tricked. And I had plenty of experience
            handling bullies who liked to do that stuff to me. I hefted the shield on my arm and turned to my
            friends. ‚ÄúWe need to have a little talk with Ares.‚Äù</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 16: WE TAKE A ZEBRA TO VEGAS</h2>

                    class="calibre12">T</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">HE WAR GOD WAS
              WAITING FOR US IN</span> the diner parking lot. ‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt get yourself
            killed.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou knew it was a trap,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares gave me a wicked grin. ‚ÄúBet that crippled blacksmith was surprised when he
            netted a couple of stupid kids. You looked good on TV.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I shoved his shield at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a jerk.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover caught their breath.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares grabbed the shield and spun it in the air like pizza dough. It changed form,
            melting into a bulletproof vest. He slung it across his back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSee that truck over there?‚Äù He pointed to an eighteen-wheeler parked across the
            street from the diner. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your ride. Take you straight to L.A., with one stop in Vegas.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The eighteen-wheeler had a sign on the back, which I could read only because it was
            reverse-printed white on black, a good combination for dyslexia: <span class="calibre5">KINDNESS
              INTERNATIONAL: HUMANE ZOO TRANSPORT. WARNING: LIVE</span> <span class="calibre5">WILD
              ANIMALS</span>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares snapped his fingers. The back door of the truck unlatched. ‚ÄúFree ride west,
            punk. Stop complaining. And here‚Äôs a little something for doing the job.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-249" class="calibre17">He slung a blue nylon backpack off his handlebars and tossed
            it to me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Inside were fresh clothes for all of us, twenty bucks in cash, a pouch full of
            golden drachmas, and a bag of Double Stuf Oreos.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your lousy&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThank you, Lord Ares,‚Äù Grover interrupted, giving me his best red-alert warning
            look. ‚ÄúThanks a lot.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I gritted my teeth. It was probably a deadly insult to refuse something from a god,
            but I didn‚Äôt want anything that Ares had touched. Reluctantly, I slung the backpack over my
            shoulder. I knew my anger was being caused by the war god‚Äôs presence, but I was still itching to
            punch him in the nose. He reminded me of every bully I‚Äôd ever faced: Nancy Bobofit, Clarisse, Smelly
            Gabe, sarcastic teachers&mdash;every jerk who‚Äôd called me stupid in school or laughed at me when I‚Äôd
            gotten expelled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked back at the diner, which had only a couple of customers now. The waitress
            who‚Äôd served us dinner was watching nervously out the window, like she was afraid Ares might hurt
            us. She dragged the fry cook out from the kitchen to see. She said something to him. He nodded, held
            up a little disposable camera and snapped a picture of us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Great, I thought. We‚Äôll make the papers again tomorrow.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I imagined the headline: <span class="calibre5">TWELVE-YEAR-OLD OUTLAW BEATS UP
              DEFENSELESS</span> <span class="calibre5">BIKER</span>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou owe me one more thing,‚Äù I told Ares, trying to keep my voice level. ‚ÄúYou
            promised me information about my mother.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou sure you can handle the news?‚Äù He kick-started his motorcycle. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not
            dead.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The ground seemed to spin beneath me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI mean she was taken away from the Minotaur before she could die. She was turned
            into a shower of gold, right? That‚Äôs metamorphosis. Not death. She‚Äôs being kept.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúKept. Why?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou need to study war, punk. Hostages. You take somebody to control somebody
            else.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs controlling me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He laughed. ‚ÄúOh yeah? See you around, kid.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I balled up my fists. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty smug, Lord Ares, for a guy who runs from Cupid
            statues.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-250" class="calibre17">Behind his sunglasses, fire glowed. I felt a hot wind in my
            hair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll meet again, Percy Jackson. Next time you‚Äôre in a fight, watch your back.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He revved his Harley, then roared off down Delancy Street.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúThat was not smart, Percy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want a god as your enemy. Especially not that god.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, guys,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúI hate to interrupt, but‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He pointed toward the diner. At the register, the last two customers were paying
            their check, two men in identical black overalls, with a white logo on their backs that matched the
            one on the <span class="calibre5">KINDNESS INTERNATIONAL</span> truck.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre taking the zoo express,‚Äù Grover said, ‚Äúwe need to hurry.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt like it, but we had no better option. Besides, I‚Äôd seen enough of Denver.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">We ran across the street and climbed in the back of the big rig, closing the doors
            behind us.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The first thing that hit me was the smell. It was like the world‚Äôs biggest pan of
            kitty litter.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The trailer was dark inside until I uncapped Anaklusmos. The blade cast a faint
            bronze light over a very sad scene. Sitting in a row of filthy metal cages were three of the most
            pathetic zoo animals I‚Äôd ever beheld: a zebra, a male albino lion, and some weird antelope thing I
            didn‚Äôt know the name for.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Someone had thrown the lion a sack of turnips, which he obviously didn‚Äôt want to
            eat. The zebra and the antelope had each gotten a Styrofoam tray of hamburger meat. The zebra‚Äôs mane
            was matted with chewing gum, like somebody had been spitting on it in their spare time. The antelope
            had a stupid silver birthday balloon tied to one of his horns that read <span class="calibre5">OVER
              THE</span> <span class="calibre5">HILL</span>!</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Apparently, nobody had wanted to get close enough to the lion to mess with him, but
            the poor thing was pacing around on soiled blankets, in a space way too small for him, panting from
            the stuffy heat of the trailer. He had flies buzzing around his pink eyes and his ribs showed
            through his white fur.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-252" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis is kindness?‚Äù Grover yelled. ‚ÄúHumane zoo transport?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">He probably would‚Äôve gone right back outside to beat up the truckers with his reed
            pipes, and I would‚Äôve helped him, but just then the truck‚Äôs engine roared to life, the trailer
            started shaking, and we were forced to sit down or fall down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We huddled in the corner on some mildewed feed sacks, trying to ignore the smell
            and the heat and the flies. Grover talked to the animals in a series of goat bleats, but they just
            stared at him sadly. Annabeth was in favor of breaking the cages and freeing them on the spot, but I
            pointed out it wouldn‚Äôt do much good until the truck stopped moving. Besides, I had a feeling we
            might look a lot better to the lion than those turnips.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I found a water jug and refilled their bowls, then used Anaklusmos to drag the
            mismatched food out of their cages. I gave the meat to the lion and the turnips to the zebra and the
            antelope.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover calmed the antelope down, while Annabeth used her knife to cut the balloon
            off his horn. She wanted to cut the gum out of the zebra‚Äôs mane, too, but we decided that would be
            too risky with the truck bumping around. We told Grover to promise the animals we‚Äôd help them more
            in the morning, then we settled in for the night.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover curled up on a turnip sack; Annabeth opened our bag of Double Stuf Oreos and
            nibbled on one half-heartedly; I tried to cheer myself up by concentrating on the fact that we were
            halfway to Los Angeles. Halfway to our destination. It was only June fourteenth. The solstice wasn‚Äôt
            until the twenty-first. We could make it in plenty of time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">On the other hand, I had no idea what to expect next. The gods kept toying with me.
            At least Hephaestus had the decency to be honest about it&mdash; he‚Äôd put up cameras and advertised
            me as entertainment. But even when the cameras weren‚Äôt rolling, I had a feeling my quest was being
            watched. I was a source of amusement for the gods.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Annabeth said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for freaking out back at the water park, Percy.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù She shuddered. ‚ÄúSpiders.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause of the Arachne story,‚Äù I guessed. ‚ÄúShe got turned into a spider for
            challenging your mom to a weaving contest, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-253" class="calibre17">Annabeth nodded. ‚ÄúArachne‚Äôs children have been taking revenge
            on the children of Athena ever since. If there‚Äôs a spider within a mile of me, it‚Äôll find me. I hate
            the creepy little things. Anyway, I owe you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a team, remember?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBesides, Grover did the fancy flying.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought he was asleep, but he mumbled from the corner, ‚ÄúI was pretty amazing,
            wasn‚Äôt I?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and I laughed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She pulled apart an Oreo, handed me half. ‚ÄúIn the Iris message‚Ä¶did Luke really say
            nothing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I munched my cookie and thought about how to answer. The conversation via rainbow
            had bothered me all evening. ‚ÄúLuke said you and he go way back. He also said Grover wouldn‚Äôt fail
            this time. Nobody would turn into a pine tree.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In the dim bronze light of the sword blade, it was hard to read their expressions.
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-255" class="calibre17">Grover let out a mournful bray.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI should‚Äôve told you the truth from the beginning.‚Äù His voice trembled. ‚ÄúI thought
            if you knew what a failure I was, you wouldn‚Äôt want me along.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou were the satyr who tried to rescue Thalia, the daughter of Zeus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He nodded glumly.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd the other two half-bloods Thalia befriended, the ones who got safely to camp‚Ä¶‚Äù
            I looked at Annabeth. ‚ÄúThat was you and Luke, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She put down her Oreo, uneaten. ‚ÄúLike you said, Percy, a seven-year-old half-blood
            wouldn‚Äôt have made it very far alone. Athena guided me toward help. Thalia was twelve. Luke was
            fourteen. They‚Äôd both run away from home, like me. They were happy to take me with them. They were‚Ä¶
            amazing monster-fighters, even without training. We traveled north from Virginia without any real
            plans, fending off monsters for about two weeks before Grover found us.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI was supposed to escort Thalia to camp,‚Äù he said, sniffling. ‚ÄúOnly Thalia. I had
            strict orders from Chiron: don‚Äôt do anything that would slow down the rescue. We knew Hades was
            after her, see, but I couldn‚Äôt just leave Luke and Annabeth by themselves. I thought‚Ä¶I thought I
            could lead all three of them to safety. It was my fault the Kindly Ones caught up with us. I froze.
            I got scared on the way back to camp and took some wrong turns. If I‚Äôd just been a little quicker‚Ä¶‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúNo one blames you. Thalia didn‚Äôt blame you either.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShe sacrificed herself to save us,‚Äù he said miserably. ‚ÄúHer death was my fault.
            The Council of Cloven Elders said so.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause you wouldn‚Äôt leave two other half-bloods behind?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not
            fair.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy‚Äôs right,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be here today if it weren‚Äôt for you,
            Grover. Neither would Luke. We don‚Äôt care what the council says.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover kept sniffling in the dark. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just my luck. I‚Äôm the lamest satyr ever,
            and I find the two most powerful half-bloods of the century, Thalia and Percy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not lame,‚Äù Annabeth insisted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got more courage than any satyr I‚Äôve
            ever met. Name one other who would dare go to the Underworld. I bet Percy is really glad you‚Äôre here
            right now.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She kicked me in the shin.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-256" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, which I would‚Äôve done even without the kick.
            ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not luck that you found Thalia and me, Grover. You‚Äôve got the biggest heart of any satyr ever.
            You‚Äôre a natural searcher. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll be the one who finds Pan.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I heard a deep, satisfied sigh. I waited for Grover to say something, but his
            breathing only got heavier. When the sound turned to snoring, I realized he‚Äôd fallen asleep.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow does he do that?‚Äù I marveled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúBut that was a really nice thing you told him.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI meant it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We rode in silence for a few miles, bumping around on the feed sacks. The zebra
            munched a turnip. The lion licked the last of the hamburger meat off his lips and looked at me
            hopefully.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth rubbed her necklace like she was thinking deep, strategic thoughts.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat pine-tree bead,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIs that from your first year?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She looked. She hadn‚Äôt realized what she was doing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEvery August, the counselors pick the most important event of
            the summer, and they paint it on that year‚Äôs beads. I‚Äôve got Thalia‚Äôs pine tree, a Greek trireme on
            fire, a centaur in a prom dress&mdash;now <i class="calibre7">that</i> was a weird summer‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd the college ring is your father‚Äôs?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs none of your&mdash;‚Äù She stopped herself. ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, it is.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to tell me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù She took a shaky breath. ‚ÄúMy dad sent it to me folded up in a
            letter, two summers ago. The ring was, like, his main keepsake from Athena. He wouldn‚Äôt have gotten
            through his doctoral program at Harvard without her‚Ä¶.That‚Äôs a long story. Anyway, he said he wanted
            me to have it. He apologized for being a jerk, said he loved me and missed me. He wanted me to come
            home and live with him.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound so bad.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah, well‚Ä¶the problem was, I believed him. I tried to go home for that school
            year, but my stepmom was the same as ever. She didn‚Äôt want her kids put in danger by living with a
            freak. Monsters attacked. We argued. Monsters attacked. We argued. I didn‚Äôt even make it through
            winter break. I called Chiron and came right back to Camp Half-Blood.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-257" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôll ever try living with your dad again?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She wouldn‚Äôt meet my eyes. ‚ÄúPlease. I‚Äôm not into self-inflicted pain.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt give up,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúYou should write him a letter or something.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThanks for the advice,‚Äù she said coldly, ‚Äúbut my father‚Äôs made his choice about
            who he wants to live with.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We passed another few miles in silence.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo if the gods fight,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwill things line up the way they did with the
            Trojan War? Will it be Athena versus Poseidon?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She put her head against the backpack Ares had given us, and closed her eyes. ‚ÄúI
            don‚Äôt know what my mom will do. I just know I‚Äôll fight next to you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre my friend, Seaweed Brain. Any more stupid questions?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt think of an answer for that. Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt have to. Annabeth was
            asleep.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I had trouble following her example, with Grover snoring and an albino lion staring
            hungrily at me, but eventually I closed my eyes.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">My nightmare started out as something I‚Äôd dreamed a million times before: I was
            being forced to take a standardized test while wearing a straitjacket. All the other kids were going
            out to recess, and the teacher kept saying, <i class="calibre7">Come on, Percy. You‚Äôre not stupid,
              are you? Pick up your pencil.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then the dream strayed from the usual.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked over at the next desk and saw a girl sitting there, also wearing a
            straitjacket. She was my age, with unruly black, punk-style hair, dark eyeliner around stormy green
            eyes, and freckles across her nose. Somehow, I knew who she was. She was Thalia, daughter of Zeus.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">She struggled against the straitjacket, glared at me in frustration, and snapped,
            <i class="calibre7">Well, Seaweed Brain? One of us has to get out of here.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">She‚Äôs right, my dream-self thought. I‚Äôm going back to that cavern. I‚Äôm going to
            give Hades a piece of my mind.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The straitjacket melted off me. I fell through the classroom floor. The teacher‚Äôs
            voice changed until it was cold and evil, echoing from the depths of a great chasm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Percy Jackson,</i> it said. <i class="calibre7">Yes, the
              exchange went well, I see.</i></p>
          <p id="calibre_link-258" class="calibre17">I was back in the dark cavern, spirits of the dead drifting
            around me. Unseen in the pit, the monstrous thing was speaking, but this time it wasn‚Äôt addressing
            me. The numbing power of its voice seemed directed somewhere else.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">And he suspects nothing?</i> it asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Another voice, one I almost recognized, answered at my shoulder. <i
              class="calibre7">Nothing, my lord. He is as ignorant as the rest.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked over, but no one was there. The speaker was invisible.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Deception upon deception,</i> the thing in the pit mused aloud.
            <i class="calibre7">Excellent.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Truly, my lord,</i> said the voice next to me, <i
              class="calibre7">you are well-named the Crooked One. But was it really necessary? I could have
              brought you what I stole directly&mdash;</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">You?</i> the monster said in scorn. <i class="calibre7">You
              have already shown your limits. You would have failed me completely had I not intervened.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">But, my lord&mdash;</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Peace, little servant. Our six months have brought us much.
              Zeus‚Äôs anger has grown. Poseidon has played his most desperate card. Now we shall use it against
              him. Shortly you shall have the reward you wish, and your revenge. As soon as both items are
              delivered into my hands‚Ä¶but wait. He is here.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">What?</i> The invisible servant suddenly sounded tense. <i
              class="calibre7">You summoned him, my lord?</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">No</i>. The full force of the monster‚Äôs attention was now
            pouring over me, freezing me in place. <i class="calibre7">Blast his father‚Äôs blood&mdash;he is too
              changeable, too unpredictable. The boy brought himself hither.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Impossible!</i> the servant cried.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">For a weakling such as you, perhaps,</i> the voice snarled.
            Then its cold power turned back on me. <i class="calibre7">So‚Ä¶you wish to dream of your quest, young
              half-blood? Then I will oblige.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">The scene changed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was standing in a vast throne room with black marble walls and bronze floors. The
            empty, horrid throne was made from human bones fused together. Standing at the foot of the dais was
            my mother, frozen in shimmering golden light, her arms outstretched.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-260" class="calibre17">I tried to step toward her, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. I
            reached for her, only to realize that my hands were withering to bones. Grinning skeletons in Greek
            armor crowded around me, draping me with silk robes, wreathing my head with laurels that smoked with
            Chimera poison, burning into my scalp.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The evil voice began to laugh. <i class="calibre7">Hail, the conquering hero!</i>
          </p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">I woke with a start.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was shaking my shoulder. ‚ÄúThe truck‚Äôs stopped,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe think they‚Äôre
            coming to check on the animals.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHide!‚Äù Annabeth hissed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She had it easy. She just put on her magic cap and disappeared. Grover and I had to
            dive behind feed sacks and hope we looked like turnips.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The trailer doors creaked open. Sunlight and heat poured in.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMan!‚Äù one of the truckers said, waving his hand in front of his ugly nose. ‚ÄúI wish
            I hauled appliances.‚Äù He climbed inside and poured some water from a jug into the animals‚Äô dishes.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou hot, big boy?‚Äù he asked the lion, then splashed the rest of the bucket right
            in the lion‚Äôs face.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The lion roared in indignation.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah, yeah, yeah,‚Äù the man said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Next to me, under the turnip sacks, Grover tensed. For a peace-loving herbivore, he
            looked downright murderous.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The trucker threw the antelope a squashed-looking Happy Meal bag. He smirked at the
            zebra. ‚ÄúHow ya doin‚Äô, Stripes? Least we‚Äôll be getting rid of <i class="calibre7">you</i> this stop.
            You like magic shows? You‚Äôre gonna love this one. They‚Äôre gonna saw you in half!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The zebra, wild-eyed with fear, looked straight at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was no sound, but as clear as day, I heard it say: <i class="calibre7">Free
              me, lord. Please.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was too stunned to react.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was a loud <i class="calibre7">knock, knock, knock</i> on the side of the
            trailer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The trucker inside with us yelled, ‚ÄúWhat do you want, Eddie?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A voice outside&mdash;it must‚Äôve been Eddie‚Äôs&mdash;shouted back, ‚ÄúMaurice? What‚Äôd
            you say?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat are you banging for?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Knock, knock, knock.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Outside, Eddie yelled, ‚ÄúWhat banging?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-261" class="calibre17">Our guy Maurice rolled his eyes and went back outside,
            cursing at Eddie for being an idiot.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A second later, Annabeth appeared next to me. She must‚Äôve done the banging to get
            Maurice out of the trailer. She said, ‚ÄúThis transport business can‚Äôt be legal.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo kidding,‚Äù Grover said. He paused, as if listening. ‚ÄúThe lion says these guys
            are animal smugglers!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">That‚Äôs right,</i> the zebra‚Äôs voice said in my mind.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to free them!‚Äù Grover said. He and Annabeth both looked at me, waiting
            for my lead.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôd heard the zebra talk, but not the lion. Why? Maybe it was another learning
            disability‚Ä¶I could only understand zebras? Then I thought: horses. What had Annabeth said about
            Poseidon creating horses? Was a zebra close enough to a horse? Was that why I could understand it?
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">The zebra said, <i class="calibre7">Open my cage, lord. Please. I‚Äôll be fine after
              that.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Outside, Eddie and Maurice were still yelling at each other, but I knew they‚Äôd be
            coming inside to torment the animals again any minute. I grabbed Riptide and slashed the lock off
            the zebra‚Äôs cage.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The zebra burst out. It turned to me and bowed. <i class="calibre7">Thank you,
              lord.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover held up his hands and said something to the zebra in goat talk, like a
            blessing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Just as Maurice was poking his head back inside to check out the noise, the zebra
            leaped over him and into the street. There was yelling and screaming and cars honking. We rushed to
            the doors of the trailer in time to see the zebra galloping down a wide boulevard lined with hotels
            and casinos and neon signs. We‚Äôd just released a zebra in Las Vegas.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Maurice and Eddie ran after it, with a few policemen running after them, shouting,
            ‚ÄúHey! You need a permit for that!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNow would be a good time to leave,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe other animals first,‚Äù Grover said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I cut the locks with my sword. Grover raised his hands and spoke the same
            goat-blessing he‚Äôd used for the zebra.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood luck,‚Äù I told the animals. The antelope and the lion burst out of their cages
            and went off together into the streets.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Some tourists screamed. Most just backed off and took pictures, probably thinking
            it was some kind of stunt by one of the casinos.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWill the animals be okay?‚Äù I asked Grover. ‚ÄúI mean, the desert and all &mdash;‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI placed a satyr‚Äôs sanctuary on them.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMeaning?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMeaning they‚Äôll reach the wild safely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll find water, food, shade,
            whatever they need until they find a safe place to live.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you place a blessing like that on us?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt only works on wild animals.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo it would only affect Percy,‚Äù Annabeth reasoned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I protested.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúKidding,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs get out of this filthy truck.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We stumbled out into the desert afternoon. It was a hundred and ten degrees, easy,
            and we must‚Äôve looked like deep-fried vagrants, but everybody was too interested in the wild animals
            to pay us much attention.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-263" class="calibre17">We passed the Monte Carlo and the MGM. We passed pyramids, a
            pirate ship, and the Statue of Liberty, which was a pretty small replica, but still made me
            homesick.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt sure what we were looking for. Maybe just a place to get out of the heat
            for a few minutes, find a sandwich and a glass of lemonade, make a new plan for getting west.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We must have taken a wrong turn, because we found ourselves at a dead end, standing
            in front of the Lotus Hotel and Casino. The entrance was a huge neon flower, the petals lighting up
            and blinking. No one was going in or out, but the glittering chrome doors were open, spilling out
            air-conditioning that smelled like flowers&mdash;lotus blossom, maybe. I‚Äôd never smelled one, so I
            wasn‚Äôt sure.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The doorman smiled at us. ‚ÄúHey, kids. You look tired. You want to come in and sit
            down?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôd learned to be suspicious, the last week or so. I figured anybody might be a
            monster or a god. You just couldn‚Äôt tell. But this guy was normal. One look at him, and I could see.
            Besides, I was so relieved to hear somebody who sounded sympathetic that I nodded and said we‚Äôd love
            to come in. Inside, we took one look around, and Grover said, ‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The whole lobby was a giant game room. And I‚Äôm not talking about cheesy old Pac-Man
            games or slot machines. There was an indoor waterslide snaking around the glass elevator, which went
            straight up at least forty floors. There was a climbing wall on the side of one building, and an
            indoor bungee-jumping bridge. There were virtual-reality suits with working laser guns. And hundreds
            of video games, each one the size of a widescreen TV. Basically, you name it, this place had it.
            There were a few other kids playing, but not that many. No waiting for any of the games. There were
            waitresses and snack bars all around, serving every kind of food you can imagine.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù a bellhop said. At least I guessed he was a bellhop. He wore a
            white-and-yellow Hawaiian shirt with lotus designs, shorts, and flip-flops. ‚ÄúWelcome to the Lotus
            Casino. Here‚Äôs your room key.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stammered, ‚ÄúUm, but‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù he said, laughing. ‚ÄúThe bill‚Äôs taken care of. No extra charges, no tips.
            Just go on up to the top floor, room 4001. If you need anything, like extra bubbles for the hot tub,
            or skeet targets for the shooting range, or whatever, just call the front desk. Here are your
            LotusCash cards. They work in the restaurants and on all the games and rides.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-264" class="calibre17">He handed us each a green plastic credit card.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I knew there must be some mistake. Obviously he thought we were some millionaire‚Äôs
            kids. But I took the card and said, ‚ÄúHow much is on here?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His eyebrows knit together. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI mean, when does it run out of cash?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He laughed. ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre making a joke. Hey, that‚Äôs cool. Enjoy your stay.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We took the elevator upstairs and checked out our room. It was a suite with three
            separate bedrooms and a bar stocked with candy, sodas, and chips. A hotline to room service. Fluffy
            towels and water beds with feather pillows. A big-screen television with satellite and high-speed
            Internet. The balcony had its own hot tub, and sure enough, there was a skeet-shooting machine and a
            shotgun, so you could launch clay pigeons right over the Las Vegas skyline and plug them with your
            gun. I didn‚Äôt see how that could be legal, but I thought it was pretty cool. The view over the Strip
            and the desert was amazing, though I doubted we‚Äôd ever find time to look at the view with a room
            like this.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-266" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, goodness,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúThis place is‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSweet,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúAbsolutely sweet.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There were clothes in the closet, and they fit me. I frowned, thinking that this
            was a little strange.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I threw Ares‚Äôs backpack in the trash can. Wouldn‚Äôt need that anymore. When we left,
            I could just charge a new one at the hotel store.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took a shower, which felt awesome after a week of grimy travel. I changed
            clothes, ate a bag of chips, drank three Cokes, and came out feeling better than I had in a long
            time. In the back of my mind, some small problem kept nagging me. I‚Äôd had a dream or something‚Ä¶I
            needed to talk to my friends. But I was sure it could wait.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I came out of the bedroom and found that Annabeth and Grover had also showered and
            changed clothes. Grover was eating potato chips to his heart‚Äôs content, while Annabeth cranked up
            the National Geographic Channel.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll those stations,‚Äù I told her, ‚Äúand you turn on National Geographic. Are you
            insane?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI feel good,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúI love this place.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Without his even realizing it, the wings sprouted out of his shoes and lifted him a
            foot off the ground, then back down again.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù Annabeth asked. ‚ÄúSleep?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and I looked at each other and grinned. We both held up our green plastic
            LotusCash cards.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPlay time,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I had so much fun. I came from a relatively poor
            family. Our idea of a splurge was eating out at Burger King and renting a video. A five-star Vegas
            hotel? Forget it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I bungee-jumped the lobby five or six times, did the waterslide, snowboarded the
            artificial ski slope, and played virtual-reality laser tag and FBI sharpshooter. I saw Grover a few
            times, going from game to game. He really liked the reverse hunter thing&mdash;where the deer go out
            and shoot the rednecks. I saw Annabeth playing trivia games and other brainiac stuff. They had this
            huge 3-D sim game where you build your own city, and you could actually see the holographic
            buildings rise on the display board. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, but Annabeth loved it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôm not sure when I first realized something was wrong.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-267" class="calibre17">Probably, it was when I noticed the guy standing next to me
            at VR sharpshooters. He was about thirteen, I guess, but his clothes were weird. I thought he was
            some Elvis impersonator‚Äôs son. He wore bell-bottom jeans and a red T-shirt with black piping, and
            his hair was permed and gelled like a New Jersey girl‚Äôs on homecoming night.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We played a game of sharpshooters together and he said, ‚ÄúGroovy, man. Been here two
            weeks, and the games keep getting better and better.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Groovy?</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Later, while we were talking, I said something was ‚Äúsick,‚Äù and he looked at me kind
            of startled, as if he‚Äôd never heard the word used that way before.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He said his name was Darrin, but as soon as I started asking him questions he got
            bored with me and started to go back to the computer screen.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúHey, Darrin?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat year is it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He frowned at me. ‚ÄúIn the game?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo. In real life.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He had to think about it. ‚Äú1977.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, getting a little scared. ‚ÄúReally.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, man. Bad vibes. I got a game happening.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After that he totally ignored me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I started talking to people, and I found it wasn‚Äôt easy. They were glued to the TV
            screen, or the video game, or their food, or whatever. I found a guy who told me it was 1985.
            Another guy told me it was 1993. They all claimed they hadn‚Äôt been in here very long, a few days, a
            few weeks at most. They didn‚Äôt really know and they didn‚Äôt care.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then it occurred to me: how long had I been here? It seemed like only a couple of
            hours, but was it?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to remember why we were here. We were going to Los Angeles. We were
            supposed to find the entrance to the Underworld. My mother‚Ä¶for a scary second, I had trouble
            remembering her name. Sally. Sally Jackson. I had to find her. I had to stop Hades from causing
            World War III.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I found Annabeth still building her city.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get out of here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">No response.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I shook her. ‚ÄúAnnabeth?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-268" class="calibre17">She looked up, annoyed. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe need to leave.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLeave? What are you talking about? I‚Äôve just got the towers&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis place is a trap.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She didn‚Äôt respond until I shook her again. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúListen. The Underworld. Our quest!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, come on, Percy. Just a few more minutes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnnabeth, there are people here from 1977. Kids who have never aged. You check in,
            and you stay forever.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúCan you imagine a better place?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I grabbed her wrist and yanked her away from the game.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù She screamed and hit me, but nobody else even bothered looking at us. They
            were too busy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I made her look directly in my eyes. I said, ‚ÄúSpiders. Large, hairy spiders.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That jarred her. Her vision cleared. ‚ÄúOh my gods,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHow long have
            we&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but we‚Äôve got to find Grover.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We went searching, and found him still playing Virtual Deer Hunter.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover!‚Äù we both shouted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He said, ‚ÄúDie, human! Die, silly polluting nasty person!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He turned the plastic gun on me and started clicking, as if I were just another
            image on the screen.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at Annabeth, and together we took Grover by the arms and dragged him away.
            His flying shoes sprang to life and started tugging his legs in the other direction as he shouted,
            ‚ÄúNo! I just got to a new level! No!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Lotus bellhop hurried up to us. ‚ÄúWell, now, are you ready for your platinum
            cards?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-270" class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù I told him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSuch a shame,‚Äù he said, and I got the feeling that he really meant it, that we‚Äôd
            be breaking his heart if we went. ‚ÄúWe just added an entire new floor full of games for platinum-card
            members.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He held out the cards, and I wanted one. I knew that if I took one, I‚Äôd never
            leave. I‚Äôd stay here, happy forever, playing games forever, and soon I‚Äôd forget my mom, and my
            quest, and maybe even my own name. I‚Äôd be playing virtual rifleman with groovy Disco Darrin forever.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover reached for the card, but Annabeth yanked back his arm and said, ‚ÄúNo,
            thanks.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We walked toward the door, and as we did, the smell of the food and the sounds of
            the games seemed to get more and more inviting. I thought about our room upstairs. We could just
            stay the night, sleep in a real bed for once‚Ä¶.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then we burst through the doors of the Lotus Casino and ran down the sidewalk. It
            felt like afternoon, about the same time of day we‚Äôd gone into the casino, but something was wrong.
            The weather had completely changed. It was stormy, with heat lightning flashing out in the desert.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares‚Äôs backpack was slung over my shoulder, which was odd, because I was sure I had
            thrown it in the trash can in room 4001, but at the moment I had other problems to worry about.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I ran to the nearest newspaper stand and read the year first. Thank the gods, it
            was the same year it had been when we went in. Then I noticed the date: June twentieth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We had been in the Lotus Casino for five days.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We had only one day left until the summer solstice. One day to complete our quest.

            A<span class="calibre5">NNABETH‚ÄôS IDEA.</span> She loaded us into the back of a Vegas taxi as if we
            actually had money, and told the driver, ‚ÄúLos Angeles, please.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The cabbie chewed his cigar and sized us up. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs three hundred miles. For that,
            you gotta pay up front.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou accept casino debit cards?‚Äù Annabeth asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He shrugged. ‚ÄúSome of ‚Äôem. Same as credit cards. I gotta swipe ‚Äôem through first.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth handed him her green LotusCash card.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He looked at it skeptically.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSwipe it,‚Äù Annabeth invited.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He did.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His meter machine started rattling. The lights flashed. Finally an infinity symbol
            came up next to the dollar sign.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The cigar fell out of the driver‚Äôs mouth. He looked back at us, his eyes wide.
            ‚ÄúWhere to in Los Angeles‚Ä¶uh, Your Highness?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-271" class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Santa Monica Pier.‚Äù Annabeth sat up a little straighter.
            I could tell she liked the ‚ÄúYour Highness‚Äù thing. ‚ÄúGet us there fast, and you can keep the change.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Maybe she shouldn‚Äôt have told him that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The cab‚Äôs speedometer never dipped below ninety-five the whole way through the
            Mojave Desert.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">On the road, we had plenty of time to talk. I told Annabeth and Grover about my
            latest dream, but the details got sketchier the more I tried to remember them. The Lotus Casino
            seemed to have short-circuited my memory. I couldn‚Äôt recall what the invisible servant‚Äôs voice had
            sounded like, though I was sure it was somebody I knew. The servant had called the monster in the
            pit something other than ‚Äúmy lord‚Äù‚Ä¶some special name or title‚Ä¶.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Silent One?‚Äù Annabeth suggested. ‚ÄúThe Rich One? Both of those are nicknames
            for Hades.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, though neither sounded quite right.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat throne room sounds like Hades‚Äôs,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs usually
            described.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I shook my head. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong. The throne room wasn‚Äôt the main part of the
            dream. And that voice from the pit‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. It just didn‚Äôt feel like a god‚Äôs voice.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth‚Äôs eyes widened.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶nothing. I was just&mdash;No, it <i class="calibre7">has</i> to be Hades. Maybe
            he sent this thief, this invisible person, to get the master bolt, and something went wrong &mdash;‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI&mdash;I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut if he stole Zeus‚Äôs symbol of power from
            Olympus, and the gods were hunting him, I mean, a lot of things could go wrong. So this thief had to
            hide the bolt, or he lost it somehow. Anyway, he failed to bring it to Hades. That‚Äôs what the voice
            said in your dream, right? The guy failed. That would explain what the Furies were searching for
            when they came after us on the bus. Maybe they thought we had retrieved the bolt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt sure what was wrong with her. She looked pale.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut if I‚Äôd already retrieved the bolt,‚Äù I said. ‚Äúwhy would I be traveling to the
            Underworld?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-272" class="calibre17">‚ÄúTo threaten Hades,‚Äù Grover suggested. ‚ÄúTo bribe or blackmail
            him into getting your mom back.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I whistled. ‚ÄúYou have evil thoughts for a goat.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy, thank you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut the thing in the pit said it was waiting for <i class="calibre7">two</i>
            items,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf the master bolt is one, what‚Äôs the other?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shook his head, clearly mystified.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth was looking at me as if she knew my next question, and was silently
            willing me not to ask it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou have an idea what might be in that pit, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù I asked her. ‚ÄúI mean, if
            it isn‚Äôt Hades?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy‚Ä¶let‚Äôs not talk about it. Because if it isn‚Äôt Hades‚Ä¶No. It has to be Hades.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Wasteland rolled by. We passed a sign that said <span class="calibre5">CALIFORNIA
              STATE LINE, 12</span> <span class="calibre5">MILES</span>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got the feeling I was missing one simple, critical piece of information. It was
            like when I stared at a common word I should know, but I couldn‚Äôt make sense of it because one or
            two letters were floating around. The more I thought about my quest, the more I was sure that
            confronting Hades wasn‚Äôt the real answer. There was something else going on, something even more
            dangerous.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The problem was: we were hurtling toward the Underworld at ninety-five miles an
            hour, betting that Hades had the master bolt. If we got there and found out we were wrong, we
            wouldn‚Äôt have time to correct ourselves. The solstice deadline would pass and war would begin.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe answer is in the Underworld,‚Äù Annabeth assured me. ‚ÄúYou saw spirits of the
            dead, Percy. There‚Äôs only one place that could be. We‚Äôre doing the right thing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She tried to boost our morale by suggesting clever strategies for getting into the
            Land of the Dead, but my heart wasn‚Äôt in it. There were just too many unknown factors. It was like
            cramming for a test without knowing the subject. And believe me, I‚Äôd done <i class="calibre7">that</i>
            enough times.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The cab sped west. Every gust of wind through Death Valley sounded like a spirit of
            the dead. Every time the brakes hissed on an eighteen-wheeler, it reminded me of Echidna‚Äôs reptilian
            voice.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-273" class="calibre1">At sunset, the taxi dropped us at the beach in Santa Monica.
            It looked exactly the way L.A. beaches do in the movies, only it smelled worse. There were carnival
            rides lining the Pier, palm trees lining the sidewalks, homeless guys sleeping in the sand dunes,
            and surfer dudes waiting for the perfect wave.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover, Annabeth, and I walked down to the edge of the surf.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù Annabeth asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The Pacific was turning gold in the setting sun. I thought about how long it had
            been since I‚Äôd stood on the beach at Montauk, on the opposite side of the country, looking out at a
            different sea.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">How could there be a god who could control all that? What did my science teacher
            use to say&mdash;two-thirds of the earth‚Äôs surface was covered in water? How could I be the son of
            someone that powerful?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stepped into the surf.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy?‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I kept walking, up to my waist, then my chest.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She called after me, ‚ÄúYou know how polluted that water is? There‚Äôre all kinds of
            toxic&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That‚Äôs when my head went under.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I held my breath at first. It‚Äôs difficult to intentionally inhale water. Finally I
            couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore. I gasped. Sure enough, I could breathe normally.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I walked down into the shoals. I shouldn‚Äôt have been able to see through the murk,
            but somehow I could tell where everything was. I could sense the rolling texture of the bottom. I
            could make out sand-dollar colonies dotting the sandbars. I could even see the currents, warm and
            cold streams swirling together.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I felt something rub against my leg. I looked down and almost shot out of the water
            like a ballistic missile. Sliding along beside me was a five-foot-long mako shark.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But the thing wasn‚Äôt attacking. It was nuzzling me. Heeling like a dog.
            Tentatively, I touched its dorsal fin. It bucked a little, as if inviting me to hold tighter. I
            grabbed the fin with both hands. It took off, pulling me along. The shark carried me down into the
            darkness. It deposited me at the edge of the ocean proper, where the sand bank dropped off into a
            huge chasm. It was like standing on the rim of the Grand Canyon at midnight, not being able to see
            much, but knowing the void was right there.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-274" class="calibre17">The surface shimmered maybe a hundred and fifty feet above. I
            knew I should‚Äôve been crushed by the pressure. Then again, I shouldn‚Äôt have been able to breathe. I
            wondered if there was a limit to how deep I could go, if I could sink straight to the bottom of the
            Pacific.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I saw something glimmering in the darkness below, growing bigger and brighter
            as it rose toward me. A woman‚Äôs voice, like my mother‚Äôs, called: ‚ÄúPercy Jackson.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As she got closer, her shape became clearer. She had flowing black hair, a dress
            made of green silk. Light flickered around her, and her eyes were so distractingly beautiful I
            hardly noticed the stallion-sized sea horse she was riding.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She dismounted. The sea horse and the mako shark whisked off and started playing
            something that looked like tag. The underwater lady smiled at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come far, Percy Jackson.
            Well done.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what to do, so I bowed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the woman who spoke to me in
            the Mississippi River.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, child. I am a Nereid, a spirit of the sea. It was not easy to appear so far
            upriver, but the naiads, my freshwater cousins, helped sustain my life force. They honor Lord
            Poseidon, though they do not serve in his court.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-276" class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶you serve in Poseidon‚Äôs court?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She nodded. ‚ÄúIt has been many years since a child of the Sea God has been born. We
            have watched you with great interest.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Suddenly I remembered faces in the waves off Montauk Beach when I was a little boy,
            reflections of smiling women. Like so many of the weird things in my life, I‚Äôd never given it much
            thought before.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf my father is so interested in me,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt he here? Why doesn‚Äôt he
            speak to me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A cold current rose out of the depths.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDo not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly,‚Äù the Nereid told me. ‚ÄúHe stands at
            the brink of an unwanted war. He has much to occupy his time. Besides, he is forbidden to help you
            directly. The gods may not show such favoritism.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúEven to their own children?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúEspecially to them. The gods can work by indirect influence only. That is why I
            give you a warning, and a gift.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She held out her hand. Three white pearls flashed in her palm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI know you journey to Hades‚Äôs realm,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFew mortals have ever done this
            and survived: Orpheus, who had great music skill; Hercules, who had great strength; Houdini, who
            could escape even the depths of Tartarus. Do you have these talents?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-277" class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶no, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh, but you have something else, Percy. You have gifts you have only begun to
            know. The Oracles have foretold a great and terrible future for you, should you survive to manhood.
            Poseidon would not have you die before your time. Therefore take these, and when you are in need,
            smash a pearl at your feet.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat will happen?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúdepends on the need. But remember: what belongs to the sea will
            always return to the sea.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat about the warning?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her eyes flickered with green light. ‚ÄúGo with what your heart tells you, or you
            will lose all. Hades feeds on doubt and hopelessness. He will trick you if he can, make you mistrust
            your own judgment. Once you are in his realm, he will never willingly let you leave. Keep faith.
            Good luck, Percy Jackson.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She summoned her sea horse and rode toward the void.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúAt the river, you said not to trust the gifts. What gifts?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood-bye, young hero,‚Äù she called back, her voice fading into the depths. ‚ÄúYou
            must listen to your heart.‚Äù She became a speck of glowing green, and then she was gone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to follow her down into the darkness. I wanted to see the court of
            Poseidon. But I looked up at the sunset darkening on the surface. My friends were waiting. We had so
            little time‚Ä¶.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I kicked upward toward the shore.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When I reached the beach, my clothes dried instantly. I told Grover and Annabeth
            what had happened, and showed them the pearls.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth grimaced. ‚ÄúNo gift comes without a price.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThey were free.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She shook her head. ‚Äú‚ÄòThere is no such thing as a free lunch.‚Äô That‚Äôs an
            ancient Greek saying that translated pretty well into American. There will be a price. You wait.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">On that happy thought, we turned our backs on the sea.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">With some spare change from Ares‚Äôs backpack, we took the bus into West Hollywood. I
            showed the driver the Underworld address slip I‚Äôd taken from Aunty Em‚Äôs Garden Gnome Emporium, but
            he‚Äôd never heard of DOA Recording Studios.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-278" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou remind me of somebody I saw on TV,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúYou a
            child actor or something?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶I‚Äôm a stunt double‚Ä¶for a lot of child actors.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh! That explains it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We thanked him and got off quickly at the next stop.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We wandered for miles on foot, looking for DOA. Nobody seemed to know where it was.
            It didn‚Äôt appear in the phone book.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Twice, we ducked into alleys to avoid cop cars.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I froze in front of an appliance-store window because a television was playing an
            interview with somebody who looked very familiar&mdash;my stepdad, Smelly Gabe. He was talking to
            Barbara Walters&mdash;I mean, as if he were some kind of huge celebrity. She was interviewing him in
            our apartment, in the middle of a poker game, and there was a young blond lady sitting next to him,
            patting his hand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A fake tear glistened on his cheek. He was saying, ‚ÄúHonest, Ms. Walters, if it
            wasn‚Äôt for Sugar here, my grief counselor, I‚Äôd be a wreck. My stepson took everything I cared about.
            My wife‚Ä¶my Camaro‚Ä¶I&mdash;I‚Äôm sorry. I have trouble talking about it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere you have it, America.‚Äù Barbara Walters turned to the camera. ‚ÄúA man torn
            apart. An adolescent boy with serious issues. Let me show you, again, the last known photo of this
            troubled young fugitive, taken a week ago in Denver.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The screen cut to a grainy shot of me, Annabeth, and Grover standing outside the
            Colorado diner, talking to Ares.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho are the other children in this photo?‚Äù Barbara Walters asked dramatically.
            ‚ÄúWho is the man with them? Is Percy Jackson a delinquent, a terrorist, or perhaps the brainwashed
            victim of a frightening new cult? When we come back, we chat with a leading child psychologist. Stay
            tuned, America.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúC‚Äômon,‚Äù Grover told me. He hauled me away before I could punch a hole in the
            appliance-store window.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It got dark, and hungry-looking characters started coming out on the streets to
            play. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm a New Yorker. I don‚Äôt scare easy. But L.A. had a totally
            different feel from New York. Back home, everything seemed close. It didn‚Äôt matter how big the city
            was, you could get anywhere without getting lost. The street pattern and the subway made sense.
            There was a system to how things worked. A kid could be safe as long as he wasn‚Äôt stupid.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-279" class="calibre17">L.A. wasn‚Äôt like that. It was spread out, chaotic, hard to
            move around. It reminded me of Ares. It wasn‚Äôt enough for L.A. to be big; it had to prove it was big
            by being loud and strange and difficult to navigate, too. I didn‚Äôt know how we were ever going to
            find the entrance to the Underworld by tomorrow, the summer solstice.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We walked past gangbangers, bums, and street hawkers, who looked at us like they
            were trying to figure if we were worth the trouble of mugging.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As we hurried past the entrance of an alley, a voice from the darkness said, ‚ÄúHey,
            you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Like an idiot, I stopped.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Before I knew it, we were surrounded. A gang of kids had circled us. Six of them in
            all&mdash;white kids with expensive clothes and mean faces. Like the kids at Yancy Academy: rich
            brats playing at being bad boys.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Instinctively, I uncapped Riptide.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When the sword appeared out of nowhere, the kids backed off, but their leader was
            either really stupid or really brave, because he kept coming at me with a switchblade.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I made the mistake of swinging.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The kid yelped. But he must‚Äôve been one hundred percent mortal, because the blade
            passed harmlessly right through his chest. He looked down. ‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I figured I had about three seconds before his shock turned to anger. ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù I
            screamed at Annabeth and Grover.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We pushed two kids out of the way and raced down the street, not knowing where we
            were going. We turned a sharp corner.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere!‚Äù Annabeth shouted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Only one store on the block looked open, its windows glaring with neon. The sign
            above the door said something like <span class="calibre5">CRSTUY‚ÄôS WATRE BDE ALPACE</span>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCrusty‚Äôs Water Bed Palace?‚Äù Grover translated.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It didn‚Äôt sound like a place I‚Äôd ever go except in an emergency, but this
            definitely qualified.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We burst through the doors, ran behind a water bed, and ducked. A split second
            later, the gang of kids ran past outside.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI think we lost them,‚Äù Grover panted.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-280" class="calibre17">A voice behind us boomed, ‚ÄúLost who?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We all jumped.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Standing behind us was a guy who looked like a raptor in a leisure suit. He was at
            least seven feet tall, with absolutely no hair. He had gray, leathery skin, thick-lidded eyes, and a
            cold, reptilian smile. He moved toward us slowly, but I got the feeling he could move fast if he
            needed to.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His suit might‚Äôve come from the Lotus Casino. It belonged back in the seventies,
            big-time. The shirt was silk paisley, unbuttoned halfway down his hairless chest. The lapels on his
            velvet jacket were as wide as landing strips. The gold chains around his neck&mdash;I couldn‚Äôt even
            count them.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-282" class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm Crusty,‚Äù he said, with a tartar-yellow smile.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I resisted the urge to say, <i class="calibre7">Yes, you are.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSorry to barge in,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúWe were just, um, browsing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou mean hiding from those no-good kids,‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúThey hang around every
            night. I get a lot of people in here, thanks to them. Say, you want to look at a water bed?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was about to say <i class="calibre7">No, thanks,</i> when he put a huge paw on my
            shoulder and steered me deeper into the showroom.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was every kind of water bed you could imagine: different kinds of wood,
            different patterns of sheets; queen-size, king-size, emperor-of-the-universe-size.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis is my most popular model.‚Äù Crusty spread his hands proudly over a bed covered
            with black satin sheets, with built-in Lava Lamps on the headboard. The mattress vibrated, so it
            looked like oil-flavored Jell-O.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMillion-hand massage,‚Äù Crusty told us. ‚ÄúGo on, try it out. Shoot, take a nap. I
            don‚Äôt care. No business today, anyway.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMillion-hand massage!‚Äù Grover cried, and dove in. ‚ÄúOh, you guys! This is cool.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù Crusty said, stroking his leathery chin. ‚ÄúAlmost, almost.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAlmost what?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He looked at Annabeth. ‚ÄúDo me a favor and try this one over here, honey. Might
            fit.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúBut what&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He patted her reassuringly on the shoulder and led her over to the Safari Deluxe
            model with teakwood lions carved into the frame and a leopard-patterned comforter. When Annabeth
            didn‚Äôt want to lie down, Crusty pushed her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù she protested.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Crusty snapped his fingers. <i class="calibre7">‚ÄúErgo!‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ropes sprang from the sides of the bed, lashing around Annabeth, holding her to the
            mattress.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover tried to get up, but ropes sprang from his black-satin bed, too, and lashed
            him down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúN-not c-c-cool!‚Äù he yelled, his voice vibrating from the million-hand massage.
            ‚ÄúN-not c-cool a-at all!‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-283" class="calibre17">The giant looked at Annabeth, then turned toward me and
            grinned. ‚ÄúAlmost, darn it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to step away, but his hand shot out and clamped around the back of my neck.
            ‚ÄúWhoa, kid. Don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôll find you one in a sec.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLet my friends go.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, sure I will. But I got to make them fit, first.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll the beds are exactly six feet, see? Your friends are too short. Got to make
            them fit.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover kept struggling.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCan‚Äôt stand imperfect measurements,‚Äù Crusty muttered. <i class="calibre7">‚ÄúErgo!‚Äù</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">A new set of ropes leaped out from the top and bottom of the beds, wrapping around
            Grover and Annabeth‚Äôs ankles, then around their armpits. The ropes started tightening, pulling my
            friends from both ends.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù Crusty told me. ‚ÄúThese are stretching jobs. Maybe three extra inches
            on their spines. They might even live. Now why don‚Äôt we find a bed you like, huh?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy!‚Äù Grover yelled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mind was racing. I knew I couldn‚Äôt take on this giant water-bed salesman alone.
            He would snap my neck before I ever got my sword out.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour real name‚Äôs not Crusty, is it?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLegally, it‚Äôs Procrustes,‚Äù he admitted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe Stretcher,‚Äù I said. I remembered the story: the giant who‚Äôd tried to kill
            Theseus with excess hospitality on his way to Athens.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù the salesman said. ‚ÄúBut who can pronounce <i class="calibre7">Procrustes</i>? Bad
            for business. Now ‚ÄòCrusty,‚Äô anybody can say that.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs got a good ring to it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His eyes lit up. ‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, absolutely,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd the workmanship on these beds? Fabulous!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He grinned hugely, but his fingers didn‚Äôt loosen on my neck. ‚ÄúI tell my customers
            that. Every time. Nobody bothers to look at the workmanship. How many built-in Lava Lamp headboards
            have you seen?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot too many.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy!‚Äù Annabeth yelled. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind her,‚Äù I told Procrustes. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-284" class="calibre17">The giant laughed. ‚ÄúAll my customers are. Never six feet
            exactly. So inconsiderate. And then they complain about the fitting.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you do if they‚Äôre longer than six feet?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, that happens all the time. It‚Äôs a simple fix.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He let go of my neck, but before I could react, he reached behind a nearby sales
            desk and brought out a huge double-bladed brass ax. He said, ‚ÄúI just center the subject as best I
            can and lop off whatever hangs over on either end.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh,‚Äù I said, swallowing hard. ‚ÄúSensible.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad to come across an intelligent customer!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The ropes were really stretching my friends now. Annabeth was turning pale. Grover
            made gurgling sounds, like a strangled goose.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo, Crusty‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice light. I glanced at the sales tag on
            the valentine-shaped Honeymoon Special. ‚ÄúDoes this one really have dynamic stabilizers to stop wave
            motion?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAbsolutely. Try it out.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah, maybe I will. But would it work for a big guy like you? No waves at all?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGuaranteed.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWay.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShow me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He sat down eagerly on the bed, patted the mattress. ‚ÄúNo waves. See?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I snapped my fingers. <i class="calibre7">‚ÄúErgo.‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ropes lashed around Crusty and flattened him against the mattress.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù he yelled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCenter him just right,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The ropes readjusted themselves at my command. Crusty‚Äôs whole head stuck out the
            top. His feet stuck out the bottom.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWait! This is just a demo.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I uncapped Riptide. ‚ÄúA few simple adjustments‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-285" class="calibre17">I had no qualms about what I was about to do. If Crusty were
            human, I couldn‚Äôt hurt him anyway. If he was a monster, he deserved to turn into dust for a while.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou drive a hard bargain,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you thirty percent off on
            selected floor models!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll start with the top.‚Äù I raised my sword.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo money down! No interest for six months!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I swung the sword. Crusty stopped making offers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I cut the ropes on the other beds. Annabeth and Grover got to their feet, groaning
            and wincing and cursing me a lot.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou look taller,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúVery funny,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúBe faster next time.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at the bulletin board behind Crusty‚Äôs sales desk. There was an
            advertisement for Hermes Delivery Service, and another for the All-New Compendium of L.A. Area
            Monsters&mdash;‚ÄúThe only Monstrous Yellow Pages you‚Äôll ever need!‚Äù Under that, a bright orange flyer
            for DOA Recording Studios, offering commissions for heroes‚Äô souls. ‚ÄúWe are always looking for new
            talent!‚Äù DOA‚Äôs address was right underneath with a map.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I told my friends.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGive us a minute,‚Äù Grover complained. ‚ÄúWe were almost stretched to death!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre ready for the Underworld,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a block from here.‚Äù</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 18: ANNABETH DOES OBEDIENCE SCHOOL</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">W</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">E STOOD IN THE
              SHADOWS OF</span> Valencia Boulevard, looking up at gold letters etched in black marble: <span
              class="calibre5">DOA RECORDING STUDIOS.</span></p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Underneath, stenciled on the glass doors: <span class="calibre5">NO SOLICITORS. NO
              LOITERING. NO</span> <span class="calibre5">LIVING</span> .</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was almost midnight, but the lobby was brightly lit and full of people. Behind
            the security desk sat a tough-looking guard with sunglasses and an earpiece.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned to my friends. ‚ÄúOkay. You remember the plan.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe plan.‚Äù Grover gulped. ‚ÄúYeah. I love the plan.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúWhat happens if the plan doesn‚Äôt work?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think negative.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRight,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre entering the Land of the Dead, and I shouldn‚Äôt think
            negative.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took the pearls out of my pocket, the three milky spheres the Nereid had given me
            in Santa Monica. They didn‚Äôt seem like much of a backup in case something went wrong.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-286" class="calibre17">Annabeth put her hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Percy.
            You‚Äôre right, we‚Äôll make it. It‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She gave Grover a nudge.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, right!‚Äù he chimed in. ‚ÄúWe got this far. We‚Äôll find the master bolt and save
            your mom. No problem.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at them both, and felt really grateful. Only a few minutes before, I‚Äôd
            almost gotten them stretched to death on deluxe water beds, and now they were trying to be brave for
            my sake, trying to make me feel better.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I slipped the pearls back in my pocket. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs whup some Underworld butt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We walked inside the DOA lobby.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Muzak played softly on hidden speakers. The carpet and walls were steel gray.
            Pencil cactuses grew in the corners like skeleton hands. The furniture was black leather, and every
            seat was taken. There were people sitting on couches, people standing up, people staring out the
            windows or waiting for the elevator. Nobody moved, or talked, or did much of anything. Out of the
            corner of my eye, I could see them all just fine, but if I focused on any one of them in particular,
            they started looking‚Ä¶transparent. I could see right through their bodies.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The security guard‚Äôs desk was a raised podium, so we had to look up at him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was tall and elegant, with chocolate-colored skin and bleached-blond hair shaved
            military style. He wore tortoiseshell shades and a silk Italian suit that matched his hair. A black
            rose was pinned to his lapel under a silver name tag.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I read the name tag, then looked at him in bewilderment. ‚ÄúYour name is Chiron?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He leaned across the desk. I couldn‚Äôt see anything in his glasses except my own
            reflection, but his smile was sweet and cold, like a python‚Äôs, right before it eats you.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat a precious young lad.‚Äù He had a strange accent&mdash;British, maybe, but also
            as if he had learned English as a second language. ‚ÄúTell me, mate, do I look like a centaur?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúN-no.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSir,‚Äù he added smoothly.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-287" class="calibre17">He pinched the name tag and ran his finger under the letters.
            ‚ÄúCan you read this, mate? It says C-H-<i class="calibre7">A</i>-R-O-N. Say it with me: CARE-ON.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCharon.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAmazing! Now: Mr. Charon.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMr. Charon,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù He sat back. ‚ÄúI <i class="calibre7">hate</i> being confused with that
            old horse-man. And now, how may I help you little dead ones?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His question caught in my stomach like a fastball. I looked at Annabeth for
            support.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe want to go to the Underworld,‚Äù she said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Charon‚Äôs mouth twitched. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs refreshing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt is?‚Äù she asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúStraightforward and honest. No screaming. No ‚ÄòThere must be a mistake, Mr.
            Charon.‚Äô‚Äù He looked us over. ‚ÄúHow did you die, then?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I nudged Grover.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶drowned‚Ä¶in the bathtub.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll three of you?‚Äù Charon asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We nodded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBig bathtub.‚Äù Charon looked mildly impressed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you have coins for
            passage. Normally, with adults, you see, I could charge your American Express, or add the ferry
            price to your last cable bill. But with children‚Ä¶alas, you never die prepared. Suppose you‚Äôll have
            to take a seat for a few centuries.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, but we have coins.‚Äù I set three golden drachmas on the counter, part of the
            stash I‚Äôd found in Crusty‚Äôs office desk.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, now‚Ä¶‚Äù Charon moistened his lips. ‚ÄúReal drachmas. Real golden drachmas. I
            haven‚Äôt seen these in‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His fingers hovered greedily over the coins.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We were so close.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then Charon looked at me. That cold stare behind his glasses seemed to bore a hole
            through my chest. ‚ÄúHere now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt read my name correctly. Are you dyslexic, lad?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dead.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Charon leaned forward and took a sniff. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not dead. I should‚Äôve known. You‚Äôre
            a godling.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe have to get to the Underworld,‚Äù I insisted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Charon made a growling sound deep in his throat.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-288" class="calibre17">Immediately, all the people in the waiting room got up and
            started pacing, agitated, lighting cigarettes, running hands through their hair, or checking their
            wristwatches.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLeave while you can,‚Äù Charon told us. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just take these and forget I saw you.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">He started to go for the coins, but I snatched them back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo service, no tip.‚Äù I tried to sound braver than I felt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Charon growled again&mdash;a deep, blood-chilling sound. The spirits of the dead
            started pounding on the elevator doors.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame, too,‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúWe had more to offer.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I held up the entire bag from Crusty‚Äôs stash. I took out a fistful of drachmas and
            let the coins spill through my fingers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Charon‚Äôs growl changed into something more like a lion‚Äôs purr. ‚ÄúDo you think I can
            be bought, godling? Eh‚Ä¶just out of curiosity, how much have you got there?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA lot,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI bet Hades doesn‚Äôt pay you well enough for such hard work.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt know the half of it. How would you like to babysit these spirits all
            day? Always ‚ÄòPlease don‚Äôt let me be dead‚Äô or ‚ÄòPlease let me across for free.‚Äô I haven‚Äôt had a pay
            raise in three thousand years. Do you imagine suits like this come cheap?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou deserve better,‚Äù I agreed. ‚ÄúA little appreciation. Respect. Good pay.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">With each word, I stacked another gold coin on the counter.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Charon glanced down at his silk Italian jacket, as if imagining himself in
            something even better. ‚ÄúI must say, lad, you‚Äôre making some sense now. Just a little.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stacked another few coins. ‚ÄúI could mention a pay raise while I‚Äôm talking to
            Hades.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He sighed. ‚ÄúThe boat‚Äôs almost full, anyway. I might as well add you three and be
            off.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He stood, scooped up our money, and said, ‚ÄúCome along.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We pushed through the crowd of waiting spirits, who started grabbing at our clothes
            like the wind, their voices whispering things I couldn‚Äôt make out. Charon shoved them out of the
            way, grumbling, ‚ÄúFreeloaders.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He escorted us into the elevator, which was already crowded with souls of the dead,
            each one holding a green boarding pass. Charon grabbed two spirits who were trying to get on with us
            and pushed them back into the lobby.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-289" class="calibre17">‚ÄúRight. Now, no one get any ideas while I‚Äôm gone,‚Äù he
            announced to the waiting room. ‚ÄúAnd if anyone moves the dial off my easy-listening station again,
            I‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre here for another thousand years. Understand?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He shut the doors. He put a key card into a slot in the elevator panel and we
            started to descend.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat happens to the spirits waiting in the lobby?‚Äù Annabeth asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Charon said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúForever, or until I‚Äôm feeling generous.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶fair.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Charon raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhoever said death was fair, young miss? Wait until it‚Äôs
            your turn. You‚Äôll die soon enough, where you‚Äôre going.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get out alive,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHa.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got a sudden dizzy feeling. We weren‚Äôt going down anymore, but forward. The air
            turned misty. Spirits around me started changing shape. Their modern clothes flickered, turning into
            gray hooded robes. The floor of the elevator began swaying.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I blinked hard. When I opened my eyes, Charon‚Äôs creamy Italian suit had been
            replaced by a long black robe. His tortoiseshell glasses were gone. Where his eyes should‚Äôve been
            were empty sockets&mdash;like Ares‚Äôs eyes, except Charon‚Äôs were totally dark, full of night and
            death and despair.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He saw me looking and said, ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I managed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought he was grinning, but that wasn‚Äôt it. The flesh of his face was becoming
            transparent, letting me see straight through to his skull.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The floor kept swaying.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover said, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm getting seasick.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When I blinked again, the elevator wasn‚Äôt an elevator anymore. We were standing in
            a wooden barge. Charon was poling us across a dark, oily river, swirling with bones, dead fish, and
            other, stranger things&mdash;plastic dolls, crushed carnations, soggy diplomas with gilt edges.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe River Styx,‚Äù Annabeth murmured. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPolluted,‚Äù Charon said. ‚ÄúFor thousands of years, you humans have been throwing in
            everything as you come across&mdash;hopes, dreams, wishes that never came true. Irresponsible waste
            management, if you ask me.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-290" class="calibre17">Mist curled off the filthy water. Above us, almost lost in
            the gloom, was a ceiling of stalactites. Ahead, the far shore glimmered with greenish light, the
            color of poison.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Panic closed up my throat. What was I doing here? These people around me‚Ä¶they were
            dead.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth grabbed hold of my hand. Under normal circumstances, this would‚Äôve
            embarrassed me, but I understood how she felt. She wanted reassurance that somebody else was alive
            on this boat.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I found myself muttering a prayer, though I wasn‚Äôt quite sure who I was praying to.
            Down here, only one god mattered, and he was the one I had come to confront.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The shoreline of the Underworld came into view. Craggy rocks and black volcanic
            sand stretched inland about a hundred yards to the base of a high stone wall, which marched off in
            either direction as far as we could see. A sound came from somewhere nearby in the green gloom,
            echoing off the stones&mdash;the howl of a large animal.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOld Three-Face is hungry,‚Äù Charon said. His smile turned skeletal in the greenish
            light. ‚ÄúBad luck for you, godlings.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bottom of our boat slid onto the black sand. The dead began to disembark. A
            woman holding a little girl‚Äôs hand. An old man and an old woman hobbling along arm in arm. A boy no
            older than I was, shuffling silently along in his gray robe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Charon said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd wish you luck, mate, but there isn‚Äôt any down here. Mind you,
            don‚Äôt forget to mention my pay raise.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He counted our golden coins into his pouch, then took up his pole. He warbled
            something that sounded like a Barry Manilow song as he ferried the empty barge back across the
            river.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We followed the spirits up a well-worn path.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">I‚Äôm not sure what I was expecting&mdash;Pearly Gates, or a big black portcullis, or
            something. But the entrance to the Underworld looked like a cross between airport security and the
            Jersey Turnpike.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There were three separate entrances under one huge black archway that said <span
              class="calibre5">YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EREBUS</span>. Each entrance had a pass-through metal
            detector with security cameras mounted on top. Beyond this were tollbooths manned by black-robed
            ghouls like Charon.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-291" class="calibre17">The howling of the hungry animal was really loud now, but I
            couldn‚Äôt see where it was coming from. The three-headed dog, Cerberus, who was supposed to guard
            Hades‚Äôs door, was nowhere to be seen.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The dead queued up in three lines, two marked <span class="calibre5">ATTENDANT ON
              DUTY</span>, and one marked <span class="calibre5">EZ DEATH</span>. The <span class="calibre5">EZ
              DEATH</span> line was moving right along. The other two were crawling.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat do you figure?‚Äù I asked Annabeth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe fast line must go straight to the Asphodel Fields,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNo contest.
            They don‚Äôt want to risk judgment from the court, because it might go against them.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a court for dead people?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah. Three judges. They switch around who sits on the bench. King Minos, Thomas
            Jefferson, Shakespeare&mdash;people like that. Sometimes they look at a life and decide that person
            needs a special reward&mdash;the Fields of Elysium. Sometimes they decide on punishment. But most
            people, well, they just lived. Nothing special, good or bad. So they go to the Asphodel Fields.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd do what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover said, ‚ÄúImagine standing in a wheat field in Kansas. Forever.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHarsh,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot as harsh as that,‚Äù Grover muttered. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A couple of black-robed ghouls had pulled aside one spirit and were frisking him at
            the security desk. The face of the dead man looked vaguely familiar.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs that preacher who made the news, remember?‚Äù Grover asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, yeah.‚Äù I did remember now. We‚Äôd seen him on TV a couple of times at the Yancy
            Academy dorm. He was this annoying televangelist from upstate New York who‚Äôd raised millions of
            dollars for orphanages and then got caught spending the money on stuff for his mansion, like
            gold-plated toilet seats, and an indoor putt-putt golf course. He‚Äôd died in a police chase when his
            ‚ÄúLamborghini for the Lord‚Äù went off a cliff.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre they doing to him?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSpecial punishment from Hades,‚Äù Grover guessed. ‚ÄúThe really bad people get his
            personal attention as soon as they arrive. The Fur&mdash;the Kindly Ones will set up an eternal
            torture for him.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The thought of the Furies made me shudder. I realized I was in their home territory
            now. Old Mrs. Dodds would be licking her lips with anticipation.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-292" class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut if he‚Äôs a preacher,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúand he believes in a
            different hell‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shrugged. ‚ÄúWho says he‚Äôs seeing this place the way we‚Äôre seeing it? Humans
            see what they want to see. You‚Äôre very stubborn&mdash;er, persistent, that way.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We got closer to the gates. The howling was so loud now it shook the ground at my
            feet, but I still couldn‚Äôt figure out where it was coming from.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then, about fifty feet in front of us, the green mist shimmered. Standing just
            where the path split into three lanes was an enormous shadowy monster.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I hadn‚Äôt seen it before because it was half transparent, like the dead. Until it
            moved, it blended with whatever was behind it. Only its eyes and teeth looked solid. And it was
            staring straight at me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My jaw hung open. All I could think to say was, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a Rottweiler.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôd always imagined Cerberus as a big black mastiff. But he was obviously a
            purebred Rottweiler, except of course that he was twice the size of a woolly mammoth, mostly
            invisible, and had three heads.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-294" class="calibre17">The dead walked right up to him&mdash;no fear at all. The
            <span class="calibre5">ATTENDANT ON DUTY</span> lines parted on either side of him. The <span
              class="calibre5">EZ DEATH</span> spirits walked right between his front paws and under his
            belly, which they could do without even crouching.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to see him better,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶‚Äù Annabeth moistened her lips. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre getting
            closer to being dead.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The dog‚Äôs middle head craned toward us. It sniffed the air and growled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt can smell the living,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Grover said, trembling next to me. ‚ÄúBecause we have a plan.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Annabeth said. I‚Äôd never heard her voice sound quite so small. ‚ÄúA plan.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">We moved toward the monster.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The middle head snarled at us, then barked so loud my eyeballs rattled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCan you understand it?‚Äù I asked Grover.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh yeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can understand it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it saying?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think humans have a four-letter word that translates, exactly.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took the big stick out of my backpack&mdash;a bedpost I‚Äôd broken off Crusty‚Äôs
            Safari Deluxe floor model. I held it up, and tried to channel happy dog thoughts toward
            Cerberus&mdash;Alpo commercials, cute little puppies, fire hydrants. I tried to smile, like I wasn‚Äôt
            about to die.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, Big Fella,‚Äù I called up. ‚ÄúI bet they don‚Äôt play with you much.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúGROWWWLLLL!‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood boy,‚Äù I said weakly.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I waved the stick. The dog‚Äôs middle head followed the movement. The other two heads
            trained their eyes on me, completely ignoring the spirits. I had Cerberus‚Äôs undivided attention. I
            wasn‚Äôt sure that was a good thing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFetch!‚Äù I threw the stick into the gloom, a good solid throw. I heard it go <i
              class="calibre7">ker-sploosh</i> in the River Styx.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cerberus glared at me, unimpressed. His eyes were baleful and cold.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">So much for the plan.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cerberus was now making a new kind of growl, deeper down in his three throats.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúPercy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-295" class="calibre17">‚ÄúI just thought you‚Äôd want to know.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCerberus? He‚Äôs saying we‚Äôve got ten seconds to pray to the god of our choice.
            After that‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶he‚Äôs hungry.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Annabeth said. She started rifling through her pack.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Uh-oh, I thought.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFive seconds,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúDo we run now?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth produced a red rubber ball the size of a grapefruit. It was labeled <span
              class="calibre5">WATERLAND, DENVER, CO</span>. Before I could stop her, she raised the ball and
            marched straight up to Cerberus.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She shouted, ‚ÄúSee the ball? You want the ball, Cerberus? Sit!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cerberus looked as stunned as we were.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">All three of his heads cocked sideways. Six nostrils dilated.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSit!‚Äù Annabeth called again.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was sure that any moment she would become the world‚Äôs largest Milkbone dog
            biscuit.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-297" class="calibre17">But instead, Cerberus licked his three sets of lips, shifted
            on his haunches, and sat, immediately crushing a dozen spirits who‚Äôd been passing underneath him in
            the <span class="calibre5">EZ DEATH</span> line. The spirits made muffled hisses as they dissipated,
            like the air let out of tires.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúGood boy!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She threw Cerberus the ball.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He caught it in his middle mouth. It was barely big enough for him to chew, and the
            other heads started snapping at the middle, trying to get the new toy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDrop it!‚Äù Annabeth ordered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cerberus‚Äôs heads stopped fighting and looked at her. The ball was wedged between
            two of his teeth like a tiny piece of gum. He made a loud, scary whimper, then dropped the ball, now
            slimy and bitten nearly in half, at Annabeth‚Äôs feet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood boy.‚Äù She picked up the ball, ignoring the monster spit all over it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She turned toward us. ‚ÄúGo now. <span class="calibre5">EZ DEATH</span>
            line&mdash;it‚Äôs faster.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNow!‚Äù she ordered, in the same tone she was using on the dog.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and I inched forward warily.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cerberus started to growl.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúStay!‚Äù Annabeth ordered the monster. ‚ÄúIf you want the ball, stay!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cerberus whimpered, but he stayed where he was.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù I asked Annabeth as we passed her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm doing, Percy,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúAt least, I‚Äôm pretty sure‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and I walked between the monster‚Äôs legs.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Please, Annabeth, I prayed. Don‚Äôt tell him to sit again.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We made it through. Cerberus wasn‚Äôt any less scary-looking from the back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúGood dog!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She held up the tattered red ball, and probably came to the same conclusion I
            did&mdash;if she rewarded Cerberus, there‚Äôd be nothing left for another trick.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She threw the ball anyway. The monster‚Äôs left mouth immediately snatched it up,
            only to be attacked by the middle head, while the right head moaned in protest.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-298" class="calibre17">While the monster was distracted, Annabeth walked briskly
            under its belly and joined us at the metal detector.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow did you do that?‚Äù I asked her, amazed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúObedience school,‚Äù she said breathlessly, and I was surprised to see there were
            tears in her eyes. ‚ÄúWhen I was little, at my dad‚Äôs house, we had a Doberman‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNever mind that,‚Äù Grover said, tugging at my shirt. ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We were about to bolt through the <span class="calibre5">EZ DEATH</span> line when
            Cerberus moaned pitifully from all three mouths. Annabeth stopped.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She turned to face the dog, which had done a one-eighty to look at us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cerberus panted expectantly, the tiny red ball in pieces in a puddle of drool at
            its feet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood boy,‚Äù Annabeth said, but her voice sounded melancholy and uncertain.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The monster‚Äôs heads turned sideways, as if worried about her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring you another ball soon,‚Äù Annabeth promised faintly. ‚ÄúWould you like
            that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The monster whimpered. I didn‚Äôt need to speak dog to know Cerberus was still
            waiting for the ball.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood dog. I‚Äôll come visit you soon. I&mdash;I promise.‚Äù Annabeth turned to us.
            ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover and I pushed through the metal detector, which immediately screamed and set
            off flashing red lights. ‚ÄúUnauthorized possessions! Magic detected!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Cerberus started to bark.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We burst through the <span class="calibre5">EZ DEATH</span> gate, which started
            even more alarms blaring, and raced into the Underworld.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A few minutes later, we were hiding, out of breath, in the rotten trunk of an
            immense black tree as security ghouls scuttled past, yelling for backup from the Furies.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover murmured, ‚ÄúWell, Percy, what have we learned today?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Grover told me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned that your plans really, really bite!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt sure about that. I thought maybe Annabeth and I had both had the right
            idea. Even here in the Underworld, everybody&mdash;even monsters&mdash; needed a little attention
            once in a while.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-299" class="calibre17">I thought about that as we waited for the ghouls to pass. I
            pretended not to see Annabeth wipe a tear from her cheek as she listened to the mournful keening of
            Cerberus in the distance, longing for his new friend.</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 19: WE FIND OUT THE TRUTH, SORT OF</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">I</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">MAGINE THE
              LARGEST CONCERT CROWD</span> you‚Äôve ever seen, a football field packed with a million fans.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Now imagine a field a million times that big, packed with people, and imagine the
            electricity has gone out, and there is no noise, no light, no beach ball bouncing around over the
            crowd. Something tragic has happened backstage. Whispering masses of people are just milling around
            in the shadows, waiting for a concert that will never start.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">If you can picture that, you have a pretty good idea what the Fields of Asphodel
            looked like. The black grass had been trampled by eons of dead feet. A warm, moist wind blew like
            the breath of a swamp. Black trees&mdash; Grover told me they were poplars&mdash;grew in clumps here
            and there.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The cavern ceiling was so high above us it might‚Äôve been a bank of storm clouds,
            except for the stalactites, which glowed faint gray and looked wickedly pointed, I tried not to
            imagine they‚Äôd fall on us at any moment, but dotted around the fields were several that had fallen
            and impaled themselves in the black grass. I guess the dead didn‚Äôt have to worry about little
            hazards like being speared by stalactites the size of booster rockets.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth, Grover, and I tried to blend into the crowd, keeping an eye out for
            security ghouls. I couldn‚Äôt help looking for familiar faces among the spirits of Asphodel, but the
            dead are hard to look at. Their faces shimmer. They all look slightly angry or confused. They will
            come up to you and speak, but their voices sound like chatter, like bats twittering. Once they
            realize you can‚Äôt understand them, they frown and move away.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-300" class="calibre17">The dead aren‚Äôt scary. They‚Äôre just sad.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We crept along, following the line of new arrivals that snaked from the main gates
            toward a black-tented pavilion with a banner that read:</p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">JUDGMENTS FOR ELYSIUM AND </span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">ETERNAL DAMNATION</span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">Welcome, Newly Deceased!</span></p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre17">Out the back of the tent came two much smaller lines.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">To the left, spirits flanked by security ghouls were marched down a rocky path
            toward the Fields of Punishment, which glowed and smoked in the distance, a vast, cracked wasteland
            with rivers of lava and minefields and miles of barbed wire separating the different torture areas.
            Even from far away, I could see people being chased by hellhounds, burned at the stake, forced to
            run naked through cactus patches or listen to opera music. I could just make out a tiny hill, with
            the ant-size figure of Sisyphus struggling to move his boulder to the top. And I saw worse tortures,
            too&mdash;things I don‚Äôt want to describe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The line coming from the right side of the judgment pavilion was much better. This
            one led down toward a small valley surrounded by walls&mdash;a gated community, which seemed to be
            the only happy part of the Underworld. Beyond the security gate were neighborhoods of beautiful
            houses from every time period in history, Roman villas and medieval castles and Victorian mansions.
            Silver and gold flowers bloomed on the lawns. The grass rippled in rainbow colors. I could hear
            laughter and smell barbecue cooking.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Elysium.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In the middle of that valley was a glittering blue lake, with three small islands
            like a vacation resort in the Bahamas. The Isles of the Blest, for people who had chosen to be
            reborn three times, and three times achieved Elysium. Immediately I knew that‚Äôs where I wanted to go
            when I died.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about,‚Äù Annabeth said, like she was reading my thoughts.
            ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the place for heroes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But I thought of how few people there were in Elysium, how tiny it was compared to
            the Fields of Asphodel or even the Fields of Punishment. So few people did good in their lives. It
            was depressing.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-301" class="calibre17">We left the judgment pavilion and moved deeper into the
            Asphodel Fields. It got darker. The colors faded from our clothes. The crowds of chattering spirits
            began to thin.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After a few miles of walking, we began to hear a familiar screech in the distance.
            Looming on the horizon was a palace of glittering black obsidian. Above the parapets swirled three
            dark batlike creatures: the Furies. I got the feeling they were waiting for us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI suppose it‚Äôs too late to turn back,‚Äù Grover said wistfully.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù I tried to sound confident.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMaybe we should search some of the other places first,‚Äù Grover suggested. ‚ÄúLike,
            Elysium, for instance‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on, goat boy.‚Äù Annabeth grabbed his arm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover yelped. His sneakers sprouted wings and his legs shot forward, pulling him
            away from Annabeth. He landed flat on his back in the grass.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover,‚Äù Annabeth chided. ‚ÄúStop messing around.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He yelped again. His shoes were flapping like crazy now. They levitated off the
            ground and started dragging him away from us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúMaia!‚Äù</i> he yelled, but the magic word seemed to have no
            effect. ‚Äú<i class="calibre7">Maia</i>, already! Nine-one-one! Help!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got over being stunned and made a grab for Grover‚Äôs hand, but too late. He was
            picking up speed, skidding downhill like a bobsled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We ran after him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth shouted, ‚ÄúUntie the shoes!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was a smart idea, but I guess it‚Äôs not so easy when your shoes are pulling you
            along feetfirst at full speed. Grover tried to sit up, but he couldn‚Äôt get close to the laces.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We kept after him, trying to keep him in sight as he zipped between the legs of
            spirits who chattered at him in annoyance.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was sure Grover was going to barrel straight through the gates of Hades‚Äôs palace,
            but his shoes veered sharply to the right and dragged him in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The slope got steeper. Grover picked up speed. Annabeth and I had to sprint to keep
            up. The cavern walls narrowed on either side, and I realized we‚Äôd entered some kind of side tunnel.
            No black grass or trees now, just rock underfoot, and the dim light of the stalactites above.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover!‚Äù I yelled, my voice echoing. ‚ÄúHold on to something!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he yelled back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was grabbing at gravel, but there was nothing big enough to slow him down.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The tunnel got darker and colder. The hairs on my arms bristled. It smelled evil
            down here. It made me think of things I shouldn‚Äôt even know about&mdash;blood spilled on an ancient
            stone altar, the foul breath of a murderer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then I saw what was ahead of us, and I stopped dead in my tracks.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The tunnel widened into a huge dark cavern, and in the middle was a chasm the size
            of a city block.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was sliding straight toward the edge.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome on, Percy!‚Äù Annabeth yelled, tugging at my wrist.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-303" class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI know!‚Äù she shouted. ‚ÄúThe place you described in your dream! But Grover‚Äôs going
            to fall if we don‚Äôt catch him.‚Äù She was right, of course. Grover‚Äôs predicament got me moving again.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was yelling, clawing at the ground, but the winged shoes kept dragging him
            toward the pit, and it didn‚Äôt look like we could possibly get to him in time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">What saved him were his hooves.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The flying sneakers had always been a loose fit on him, and finally Grover hit a
            big rock and the left shoe came flying off. It sped into the darkness, down into the chasm. The
            right shoe kept tugging him along, but not as fast. Grover was able to slow himself down by grabbing
            on to the big rock and using it like an anchor.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was ten feet from the edge of the pit when we caught him and hauled him back up
            the slope. The other winged shoe tugged itself off, circled around us angrily and kicked our heads
            in protest before flying off into the chasm to join its twin.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We all collapsed, exhausted, on the obsidian gravel. My limbs felt like lead. Even
            my backpack seemed heavier, as if somebody had filled it with rocks.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover was scratched up pretty bad. His hands were bleeding. His eyes had gone
            slit-pupiled, goat style, the way they did whenever he was terrified.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how‚Ä¶‚Äù he panted. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúListen.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I heard something&mdash;a deep whisper in the darkness.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Another few seconds, and Annabeth said, ‚ÄúPercy, this place&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúShh.‚Äù I stood.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The sound was getting louder, a muttering, evil voice from far, far below us.
            Coming from the pit.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover sat up. ‚ÄúWh&mdash;what‚Äôs that noise?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth heard it too, now. I could see it in her eyes. ‚ÄúTartarus. The entrance to
            Tartarus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I uncapped Anaklusmos.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The bronze sword expanded, gleaming in the darkness, and the evil voice seemed to
            falter, just for a moment, before resuming its chant.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I could almost make out words now, ancient, ancient words, older even that Greek.
            As if‚Ä¶</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-304" class="calibre17">‚ÄúMagic,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe have to get out of here,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Together, we dragged Grover to his hooves and started back up the tunnel. My legs
            wouldn‚Äôt move fast enough. My backpack weighed me down. The voice got louder and angrier behind us,
            and we broke into a run.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Not a moment too soon.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A cold blast of wind pulled at our backs, as if the entire pit were inhaling. For a
            terrifying moment, I lost ground, my feet slipping in the gravel. If we‚Äôd been any closer to the
            edge, we would‚Äôve been sucked in.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We kept struggling forward, and finally reached the top of the tunnel, where the
            cavern widened out into the Fields of Asphodel. The wind died. A wail of outrage echoed from deep in
            the tunnel. Something was not happy we‚Äôd gotten away.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat <i class="calibre7">was</i> that?‚Äù Grover panted, when we‚Äôd collapsed in the
            relative safety of a black poplar grove. ‚ÄúOne of Hades‚Äôs pets?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and I looked at each other. I could tell she was nursing an idea, probably
            the same one she‚Äôd gotten during the taxi ride to L.A., but she was too scared to share it. That was
            enough to terrify me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I capped my sword, put the pen back in my pocket. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep going.‚Äù I looked at
            Grover. ‚ÄúCan you walk?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He swallowed. ‚ÄúYeah, sure. I never liked those shoes, anyway.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He tried to sound brave about it, but he was trembling as badly as Annabeth and I
            were. Whatever was in that pit was nobody‚Äôs pet. It was unspeakably old and powerful. Even Echidna
            hadn‚Äôt given me that feeling. I was almost relieved to turn my back on that tunnel and head toward
            the palace of Hades.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Almost.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The Furies circled the parapets, high in the gloom. The outer walls of the fortress
            glittered black, and the two-story-tall bronze gates stood wide open.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Up close, I saw that the engravings on the gates were scenes of death. Some were
            from modern times&mdash;an atomic bomb exploding over a city, a trench filled with gas
            mask&ndash;wearing soldiers, a line of African famine victims waiting with empty bowls&mdash;but all
            of them looked as if they‚Äôd been etched into the bronze thousands of years ago. I wondered if I was
            looking at prophecies that had come true.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-305" class="calibre17">Inside the courtyard was the strangest garden I‚Äôd ever seen.
            Multicolored mushrooms, poisonous shrubs, and weird luminous plants grew without sunlight. Precious
            jewels made up for the lack of flowers, piles of rubies as big as my fist, clumps of raw diamonds.
            Standing here and there like frozen party guests were Medusa‚Äôs garden statues&mdash;petrified
            children, satyrs, and centaurs&mdash;all smiling grotesquely.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In the center of the garden was an orchard of pomegranate trees, their orange
            blooms neon bright in the dark. ‚ÄúThe garden of Persephone,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúKeep walking.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I understood why she wanted to move on. The tart smell of those pomegranates was
            almost overwhelming. I had a sudden desire to eat them, but then I remembered the story of
            Persephone. One bite of Underworld food, and we would never be able to leave. I pulled Grover away
            to keep him from picking a big juicy one.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We walked up the steps of the palace, between black columns, through a black marble
            portico, and into the house of Hades. The entry hall had a polished bronze floor, which seemed to
            boil in the reflected torchlight. There was no ceiling, just the cavern roof, far above. I guess
            they never had to worry about rain down here.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-307" class="calibre17">Every side doorway was guarded by a skeleton in military
            gear. Some wore Greek armor, some British redcoat uniforms, some camouflage with tattered American
            flags on the shoulders. They carried spears or muskets or M-16s. None of them bothered us, but their
            hollow eye sockets followed us as we walked down the hall, toward the big set of doors at the
            opposite end.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-309" class="calibre17">Two U.S. Marine skeletons guarded the doors. They grinned
            down at us, rocket-propelled grenade launchers held across their chests.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Grover mumbled, ‚ÄúI bet Hades doesn‚Äôt have trouble with door-to-door
            salesmen.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My backpack weighed a ton now. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. I wanted to open it,
            check to see if I had somehow picked up a stray bowling ball, but this wasn‚Äôt the time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, guys,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI suppose we should‚Ä¶knock?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A hot wind blew down the corridor, and the doors swung open. The guards stepped
            aside.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI guess that means <i class="calibre7">entrez-vous</i>,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The room inside looked just like in my dream, except this time the throne room of
            Hades was occupied.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was the third god I‚Äôd met, but the first who really struck me as godlike.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was at least ten feet tall, for one thing, and dressed in black silk robes and a
            crown of braided gold. His skin was albino white, his hair shoulder-length and jet black. He wasn‚Äôt
            bulked up like Ares, but he radiated power. He lounged on his throne of fused human bones, looking
            lithe, graceful, and dangerous as a panther.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I immediately felt like he should be giving the orders. He knew more than I did. He
            should be my master. Then I told myself to snap out of it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Hades‚Äôs aura was affecting me, just as Ares‚Äôs had. The Lord of the Dead resembled
            pictures I‚Äôd seen of Adolph Hitler, or Napoleon, or the terrorist leaders who direct suicide
            bombers. Hades had the same intense eyes, the same kind of mesmerizing, evil charisma.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou are brave to come here, Son of Poseidon,‚Äù he said in an oily voice. ‚ÄúAfter
            what you have done to me, very brave indeed. Or perhaps you are simply very foolish.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Numbness crept into my joints, tempting me to lie down and just take a little nap
            at Hades‚Äôs feet. Curl up here and sleep forever.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I fought the feeling and stepped forward. I knew what I had to say. ‚ÄúLord and
            Uncle, I come with two requests.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Hades raised an eyebrow. When he sat forward in his throne, shadowy faces appeared
            in the folds of his black robes, faces of torment, as if the garments were stitched of trapped souls
            from the Fields of Punishment, trying to get out. The ADHD part of me wondered, off-task, whether
            the rest of his clothes were made the same way. What horrible things would you have to do in your
            life to get woven into Hades‚Äôs underwear?</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-310" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOnly two requests?‚Äù Hades said. ‚ÄúArrogant child. As if you
            have not already taken enough. Speak, then. It amuses me not to strike you dead yet.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I swallowed. This was going about as well as I‚Äôd feared.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I glanced at the empty, smaller throne next to Hades‚Äôs. It was shaped like a black
            flower, gilded with gold. I wished Queen Persephone were here. I recalled something in the myths
            about how she could calm her husband‚Äôs moods. But it was summer. Of course, Persephone would be
            above in the world of light with her mother, the goddess of agriculture, Demeter. Her visits, not
            the tilt of the planet, create the seasons.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth cleared her throat. Her finger prodded me in the back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLord Hades,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLook, sir, there can‚Äôt be a war among the gods. It would
            be‚Ä¶bad.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúReally bad,‚Äù Grover added helpfully.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúReturn Zeus‚Äôs master bolt to me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúPlease, sir. Let me carry it to
            Olympus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Hades‚Äôs eyes grew dangerously bright. ‚ÄúYou dare keep up this pretense, after what
            you have done?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I glanced back at my friends. They looked as confused as I was.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶Uncle,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou keep saying ‚Äòafter what you‚Äôve done.‚Äô What exactly have I
            done?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The throne room shook with a tremor so strong, they probably felt it upstairs in
            Los Angeles. Debris fell from the cavern ceiling. Doors burst open all along the walls, and skeletal
            warriors marched in, hundreds of them, from every time period and nation in Western civilization.
            They lined the perimeter of the room, blocking the exits.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Hades bellowed, ‚ÄúDo you think I <i class="calibre7">want</i> war, godling?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to say, <i class="calibre7">Well, these guys don‚Äôt look like peace
              activists.</i> But I thought that might be a dangerous answer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou are the Lord of the Dead,‚Äù I said carefully. ‚ÄúA war would expand your kingdom,
            right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA typical thing for my brothers to say! Do you think I need more subjects? Did you
            not see the sprawl of the Asphodel Fields?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-312" class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHave you any idea how much my kingdom has swollen in this past century alone, how
            many subdivisions I‚Äôve had to open?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I opened my mouth to respond, but Hades was on a roll now.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMore security ghouls,‚Äù he moaned. ‚ÄúTraffic problems at the judgment pavilion.
            Double overtime for the staff. I used to be a rich god, Percy Jackson. I control all the precious
            metals under the earth. But my expenses!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCharon wants a pay raise,‚Äù I blurted, just remembering the fact. As soon as I said
            it, I wished I could sew up my mouth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me started on Charon!‚Äù Hades yelled. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been impossible ever since he
            discovered Italian suits! Problems everywhere, and I‚Äôve got to handle all of them personally. The
            commute time alone from the palace to the gates is enough to drive me insane! And the dead just keep
            arriving. <i class="calibre7">No,</i> godling. I need no help getting subjects! I did not ask for
            this war.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut you took Zeus‚Äôs master bolt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLies!‚Äù More rumbling. Hades rose from his throne, towering to the height of a
            football goalpost. ‚ÄúYour father may fool Zeus, boy, but I am not so stupid. I see his plan.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHis plan?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">You</i> were the thief on the winter solstice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYour
            father thought to keep you his little secret. He directed you into the throne room on Olympus. You
            took the master bolt <i class="calibre7">and</i> my helm. Had I not sent my Fury to discover you at
            Yancy Academy, Poseidon might have succeeded in hiding his scheme to start a war. But now you have
            been forced into the open. You will be exposed as Poseidon‚Äôs thief, and I will have my helm back!‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù Annabeth spoke. I could tell her mind was going a million miles an hour.
            ‚ÄúLord Hades, your helm of darkness is missing, too?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDo not play innocent with me, girl. You and the satyr have been helping this
            hero&mdash;coming here to threaten me in Poseidon‚Äôs name, no doubt&mdash;to bring me an ultimatum.
            Does Poseidon think I can be blackmailed into supporting him?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúPoseidon didn‚Äôt&mdash;I didn‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI have said nothing of the helm‚Äôs disappearance,‚Äù Hades snarled, ‚Äúbecause I had no
            illusions that anyone on Olympus would offer me the slightest justice, the slightest help. I can ill
            afford for word to get out that my most powerful weapon of fear is missing. So I searched for you
            myself, and when it was clear you were coming to me to deliver your threat, I did not try to stop
            you.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-313" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt try to stop us? But&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúReturn my helm now, or I will stop death,‚Äù Hades threatened. ‚ÄúThat is my
            counterproposal. I will open the earth and have the dead pour back into the world. I will make your
            lands a nightmare. And you, Percy Jackson&mdash; <i class="calibre7">your</i> skeleton will lead my
            army out of Hades.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The skeletal soldiers all took one step forward, making their weapons ready.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">At that point, I probably should have been terrified. The strange thing was, I felt
            offended. Nothing gets me angrier than being accused of something I didn‚Äôt do. I‚Äôve had a lot of
            experience with that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as bad as Zeus,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou think I stole from you? That‚Äôs why you sent
            the Furies after me?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Hades said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd the other monsters?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Hades curled his lip. ‚ÄúI had nothing to do with them. I wanted no quick death for
            you&mdash;I wanted you brought before me alive so you might face every torture in the Fields of
            Punishment. Why do you think I let you enter my kingdom so easily?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">‚ÄúEasily?‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúReturn my property!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt have your helm. I came for the master bolt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhich you already possess!‚Äù Hades shouted. ‚ÄúYou came here with it, little fool,
            thinking you could threaten me!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOpen your pack, then.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A horrible feeling struck me. The weight in my backpack, like a bowling ball. It
            couldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I slung it off my shoulder and unzipped it. Inside was a two-foot-long metal
            cylinder, spiked on both ends, humming with energy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúHow&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI&mdash;I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou heroes are always the same,‚Äù Hades said. ‚ÄúYour pride makes you foolish,
            thinking you could bring such a weapon before me. I did not ask for Zeus‚Äôs master bolt, but since it
            is here, you will yield to it to me. I am sure it will make an excellent bargaining tool. And now‚Ä¶my
            helm. Where is it?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-314" class="calibre17">I was speechless. I had no helm. I had no idea how the master
            bolt had gotten into my backpack. I wanted to think Hades was pulling some kind of trick. Hades was
            the bad guy. But suddenly the world turned sideways. I realized I‚Äôd been played with. Zeus,
            Poseidon, and Hades had been set at each other‚Äôs throats by someone else. The master bolt had been
            in the backpack, and I‚Äôd gotten the backpack from‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLord Hades, wait,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThis is all a mistake.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA mistake?‚Äù Hades roared.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The skeletons aimed their weapons. From high above, there was a fluttering of
            leathery wings, and the three Furies swooped down to perch on the back of their master‚Äôs throne. The
            one with Mrs. Dodds‚Äôs face grinned at me eagerly and flicked her whip.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere is no mistake,‚Äù Hades said. ‚ÄúI know why you have come&mdash;I know the <i
              class="calibre7">real</i> reason you brought the bolt. You came to bargain for <i
              class="calibre7">her</i>.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Hades loosed a ball of gold fire from his palm. It exploded on the steps in front
            of me, and there was my mother, frozen in a shower of gold, just as she was at the moment when the
            Minotaur began to squeeze her to death.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt speak. I reached out to touch her, but the light was as hot as a
            bonfire.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Hades said with satisfaction. ‚ÄúI took her. I knew, Percy Jackson, that you
            would come to bargain with me eventually. Return my helm, and perhaps I will let her go. She is not
            dead, you know. Not yet. But if you displease me, that will change.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about the pearls in my pocket. Maybe they could get me out of this. If I
            could just get my mom free‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh, the pearls,‚Äù Hades said, and my blood froze. ‚ÄúYes, my brother and his little
            tricks. Bring them forth, Percy Jackson.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My hand moved against my will and brought out the pearls.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOnly three,‚Äù Hades said. ‚ÄúWhat a shame. You do realize each only protects a single
            person. Try to take your mother, then, little godling. And which of your friends will you leave
            behind to spend eternity with me? Go on. Choose. Or give me the backpack and accept my terms.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at Annabeth and Grover. Their faces were grim.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe were tricked,‚Äù I told them. ‚ÄúSet up.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, but why?‚Äù Annabeth asked. ‚ÄúAnd the voice in the pit&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I intend to ask.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDecide, boy!‚Äù Hades yelled.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-315" class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy.‚Äù Grover put his hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt give
            him the bolt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI know that.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLeave me here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUse the third pearl on your mom.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm a satyr,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have souls like humans do. He can torture me
            until I die, but he won‚Äôt get me forever. I‚Äôll just be reincarnated as a flower or something. It‚Äôs
            the best way.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Annabeth drew her bronze knife. ‚ÄúYou two go on. Grover, you have to protect
            Percy. You have to get your searcher‚Äôs license and start your quest for Pan. Get his mom out of
            here. I‚Äôll cover you. I plan to go down fighting.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm staying behind.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThink again, goat boy,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúStop it, both of you!‚Äù I felt like my heart was being ripped in two. They had both
            been with me through so much. I remembered Grover dive-bombing Medusa in the statue garden, and
            Annabeth saving us from Cerberus; we‚Äôd survived Hephaestus‚Äôs Waterland ride, the St. Louis Arch, the
            Lotus Casino. I had spent thousands of miles worried that I‚Äôd be betrayed by a friend, but these
            friends would never do that. They had done nothing but save me, over and over, and now they wanted
            to sacrifice their lives for my mom.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI know what to do,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTake these.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I handed them each a pearl.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúBut Percy‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned and faced my mother. I desperately wanted to sacrifice myself and use the
            last pearl on her, but I knew what she would say. She would never allow it. I had to get the bolt
            back to Olympus and tell Zeus the truth. I had to stop the war. She would never forgive me if I
            saved her instead. I thought about the prophecy made at Half-Blood Hill, what seemed like a million
            years ago. <i class="calibre7">You will fail to save what matters most in the end.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back. I‚Äôll find a way.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The smug look on Hades‚Äôs face faded. He said, ‚ÄúGodling‚Ä¶?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll find your helm, Uncle,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll return it. Remember about Charon‚Äôs
            pay raise.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDo not defy me&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-316" class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to play with Cerberus once in a while.
            He likes red rubber balls.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy Jackson, you will not&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I shouted, ‚ÄúNow, guys!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We smashed the pearls at our feet. For a scary moment, nothing happened.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Hades yelled, ‚ÄúDestroy them!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The army of skeletons rushed forward, swords out, guns clicking to full automatic.
            The Furies lunged, their whips bursting into flame.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Just as the skeletons opened fire, the pearl fragments at my feet exploded with a
            burst of green light and a gust of fresh sea wind. I was encased in a milky white sphere, which was
            starting to float off the ground.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth and Grover were right behind me. Spears and bullets sparked harmlessly off
            the pearl bubbles as we floated up. Hades yelled with such rage, the entire fortress shook and I
            knew it was not going to be a peaceful night in L.A.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-318" class="calibre17">‚ÄúLook up!‚Äù Grover yelled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to crash!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Sure enough, we were racing right toward the stalactites, which I figured would pop
            our bubbles and skewer us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow do you control these things?‚Äù Annabeth shouted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you do!‚Äù I shouted back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We screamed as the bubbles slammed into the ceiling and‚Ä¶Darkness.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Were we dead?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">No, I could still feel the racing sensation. We were going up, right through solid
            rock as easily as an air bubble in water. That was the power of the pearls, I realized&mdash;<i
              class="calibre7">What belongs to the sea will always return to the sea.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">For a few moments, I couldn‚Äôt see anything outside the smooth walls of my sphere,
            then my pearl broke through on the ocean floor. The two other milky spheres, Annabeth and Grover,
            kept pace with me as we soared upward through the water. And&mdash;<i class="calibre7">ker-blam!</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">We exploded on the surface, in the middle of the Santa Monica Bay, knocking a
            surfer off his board with an indignant, ‚ÄúDude!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I grabbed Grover and hauled him over to a life buoy. I caught Annabeth and dragged
            her over too. A curious shark was circling us, a great white about eleven feet long.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I said, ‚ÄúBeat it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The shark turned and raced away.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The surfer screamed something about bad mushrooms and paddled away from us as fast
            as he could.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Somehow, I knew what time it was: early morning, June 21, the day of the summer
            solstice.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In the distance, Los Angeles was on fire, plumes of smoke rising from neighborhoods
            all over the city. There had been an earthquake, all right, and it was Hades‚Äôs fault. He was
            probably sending an army of the dead after me right now.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But at the moment, the Underworld wasn‚Äôt my biggest problem.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I had to get to shore. I had to get Zeus‚Äôs thunderbolt back to Olympus. Most of
            all, I had to have a serious conversation with the god who‚Äôd tricked me.</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 20: I BATTLE MY JERK RELATIVE</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">A</b></span></span></span> C<span class="calibre5">OAST</span>
            G<span class="calibre5">UARD BOAT PICKED US UP</span>, but they were too busy to keep us for long,
            or to wonder how three kids in street clothes had gotten out into the middle of the bay. There was a
            disaster to mop up. Their radios were jammed with distress calls.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They dropped us off at the Santa Monica Pier with towels around our shoulders and
            water bottles that said <span class="calibre5">I‚ÄôM A JUNIOR COAST GUARD!</span> and sped off to save
            more people.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Our clothes were sopping wet, even mine. When the Coast Guard boat had appeared,
            I‚Äôd silently prayed they wouldn‚Äôt pick me out of the water and find me perfectly dry, which might‚Äôve
            raised some eyebrows. So I‚Äôd willed myself to get soaked. Sure enough, my usual waterproof magic had
            abandoned me. I was also barefoot, because I‚Äôd given my shoes to Grover. Better the Coast Guard
            wonder why one of us was barefoot than wonder why one of us had hooves.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After reaching dry land, we stumbled down the beach, watching the city burn against
            a beautiful sunrise. I felt as if I‚Äôd just come back from the dead &mdash;which I had. My backpack
            was heavy with Zeus‚Äôs master bolt. My heart was even heavier from seeing my mother.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-319" class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúWe went all that
            way&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt was a trick,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúA strategy worthy of Athena.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she warned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou get it, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She dropped her eyes, her anger fading. ‚ÄúYeah. I get it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt!‚Äù Grover complained. ‚ÄúWould somebody&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy‚Ä¶‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about your mother. I‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I pretended not to hear her. If I talked about my mother, I was going to start
            crying like a little kid.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe prophecy was right,‚Äù I said. ‚Äú‚ÄòYou shall go west and face the god who has
            turned.‚Äô But it wasn‚Äôt Hades. Hades didn‚Äôt want war among the Big Three. Someone else pulled off the
            theft. Someone stole Zeus‚Äôs master bolt, and Hades‚Äôs helm, and framed me because I‚Äôm Poseidon‚Äôs kid.
            Poseidon will get blamed by both sides. By sundown today, there will be a three-way war. And I‚Äôll
            have caused it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover shook his head, mystified. ‚ÄúBut who would be that sneaky? Who would want war
            that bad?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stopped in my tracks, looking down the beach. ‚ÄúGee, let me think.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There he was, waiting for us, in his black leather duster and sunglasses, an
            aluminum baseball bat propped on his shoulder. His motorcycle rumbled beside him, its headlight
            turning the sand red.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, kid,‚Äù Ares said, seeming genuinely pleased to see me. ‚ÄúYou were supposed to
            die.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou tricked me,‚Äù I said. ‚Äú<i class="calibre7">You</i> stole the helm and the
            master bolt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares grinned. ‚ÄúWell, now, I didn‚Äôt steal them personally. Gods taking each other‚Äôs
            symbols of power&mdash;that‚Äôs a big no-no. But you‚Äôre not the only hero in the world who can run
            errands.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho did you use? Clarisse? She was there at the winter solstice.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The idea seemed to amuse him. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. The point is, kid, you‚Äôre impeding
            the war effort. See, you‚Äôve got to die in the Underworld. Then Old Seaweed will be mad at Hades for
            killing you. Corpse Breath will have Zeus‚Äôs master bolt, so Zeus‚Äôll be mad at <i class="calibre7">him</i>.
            And Hades is still looking for this‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-320" class="calibre17">From his pocket he took out a ski cap&mdash;the kind bank
            robbers wear&mdash;and placed it between the handlebars of his bike. Immediately, the cap
            transformed into an elaborate bronze war helmet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe helm of darkness,‚Äù Grover gasped.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Ares said. ‚ÄúNow where was I? Oh yeah, Hades will be mad at both Zeus and
            Poseidon, because he doesn‚Äôt know who took this. Pretty soon, we got a nice little three-way
            slugfest going.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre your family!‚Äù Annabeth protested.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares shrugged. ‚ÄúBest kind of war. Always the bloodiest. Nothing like watching your
            relatives fight, I always say.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou gave me the backpack in Denver,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe master bolt was in there the
            whole time.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes and no,‚Äù Ares said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably too complicated for your little mortal
            brain to follow, but the backpack is the master bolt‚Äôs sheath, just morphed a bit. The bolt is
            connected to it, sort of like that sword you got, kid. It always returns to your pocket, right?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wasn‚Äôt sure how Ares knew about that, but I guess a god of war had to make it his
            business to know about weapons.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù Ares continued. ‚ÄúI tinkered with the magic a bit, so the bolt would only
            return to the sheath once you reached the Underworld. You get close to Hades‚Ä¶Bingo, you got mail. If
            you died along the way&mdash;no loss. I still had the weapon.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut why not just keep the master bolt for yourself?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhy send it to
            Hades?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares got a twitch in his jaw. For a moment, it was almost as if he were listening
            to another voice, deep inside his head. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I‚Ä¶yeah‚Ä¶with that kind of firepower‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He held the trance for one second‚Ä¶two seconds‚Ä¶.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I exchanged nervous looks with Annabeth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares‚Äôs face cleared. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want the trouble. Better to have you caught
            redhanded, holding the thing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSending the bolt to the Underworld wasn‚Äôt your idea, was
            it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOf course it was!‚Äù Smoke drifted up from his sunglasses, as if they were about to
            catch fire.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt order the theft,‚Äù I guessed. ‚ÄúSomeone else sent a hero to steal the two
            items. Then, when Zeus sent you to hunt him down, you caught the thief. But you didn‚Äôt turn him over
            to Zeus. Something convinced you to let him go. You kept the items until another hero could come
            along and complete the delivery. That thing in the pit is ordering you around.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-321" class="calibre17">‚ÄúI am the god of war! I take orders from no one! I don‚Äôt have
            dreams!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I hesitated. ‚ÄúWho said anything about dreams?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares looked agitated, but he tried to cover it with a smirk.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get back to the problem at hand, kid. You‚Äôre alive. I can‚Äôt have you taking
            that bolt to Olympus. You just might get those hardheaded idiots to listen to you. So I‚Äôve got to
            kill you. Nothing personal.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He snapped his fingers. The sand exploded at his feet and out charged a wild boar,
            even larger and uglier than the one whose head hung above the door of cabin five at Camp Half-Blood.
            The beast pawed the sand, glaring at me with beady eyes as it lowered its razor-sharp tusks and
            waited for the command to kill.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stepped into the surf. ‚ÄúFight me yourself, Ares.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He laughed, but I heard a little edge to his laughter‚Ä¶an uneasiness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve only
            got one talent, kid, running away. You ran from the Chimera. You ran from the Underworld. You don‚Äôt
            have what it takes.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúScared?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-323" class="calibre17">‚ÄúIn your adolescent dreams.‚Äù But his sunglasses were starting
            to melt from the heat of his eyes. ‚ÄúNo direct involvement. Sorry, kid. You‚Äôre not at my level.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúPercy, run!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The giant boar charged.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But I was done running from monsters. Or Hades, or Ares, or anybody.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As the boar rushed me, I uncapped my pen and sidestepped. Riptide appeared in my
            hands. I slashed upward. The boar‚Äôs severed right tusk fell at my feet, while the disoriented animal
            charged into the sea.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-325" class="calibre17">I shouted, ‚ÄúWave!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Immediately, a wave surged up from nowhere and engulfed the boar, wrapping around
            it like a blanket. The beast squealed in terror. Then it was gone, swallowed by the sea.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned back to Ares. ‚ÄúAre you going to fight me now?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOr are you going
            to hide behind another pet pig?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares‚Äôs face was purple with rage. ‚ÄúWatch it, kid. I could turn you into&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA cockroach,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOr a tapeworm. Yeah, I‚Äôm sure. That‚Äôd save you from getting
            your godly hide whipped, wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Flames danced along the top of his glasses. ‚ÄúOh, man, you are really asking to be
            smashed into a grease spot.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf I lose, turn me into anything you want. Take the bolt. If I win, the helm and
            the bolt are mine and <i class="calibre7">you</i> have to go away.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares sneered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He swung the baseball bat off his shoulder. ‚ÄúHow would you like to get smashed:
            classic or modern?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I showed him my sword.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool, dead boy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúClassic it is.‚Äù The baseball bat changed into a
            huge, two-handed sword. The hilt was a large silver skull with a ruby in its mouth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do this. He‚Äôs a god.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a coward,‚Äù I told her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She swallowed. ‚ÄúWear this, at least. For luck.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She took off her necklace, with her five years‚Äô worth of camp beads and the ring
            from her father, and tied it around my neck.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúReconciliation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAthena and Poseidon together.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My face felt a little warm, but I managed a smile. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd take this,‚Äù Grover said. He handed me a flattened tin can that he‚Äôd probably
            been saving in his pocket for a thousand miles. ‚ÄúThe satyrs stand behind you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGrover‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He patted me on the shoulder. I stuffed the tin can in my back pocket.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou all done saying good-bye?‚Äù Ares came toward me, his black leather duster
            trailing behind him, his sword glinting like fire in the sunrise. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been fighting for eternity,
            kid. My strength is unlimited and I cannot die. What have you got?‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-326" class="calibre17">A smaller ego, I thought, but I said nothing. I kept my feet
            in the surf, backing into the water up to my ankles. I thought back to what Annabeth had said at the
            Denver diner, so long ago: <i class="calibre7">Ares has strength. That‚Äôs all he has. Even strength
              has to bow to wisdom sometimes.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">He cleaved downward at my head, but I wasn‚Äôt there.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My body thought for me. The water seemed to push me into the air and I catapulted
            over him, slashing as I came down. But Ares was just as quick. He twisted, and the strike that
            should‚Äôve caught him directly in the spine was deflected off the end of his sword hilt.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He grinned. ‚ÄúNot bad, not bad.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He slashed again and I was forced to jump onto dry land. I tried to sidestep, to
            get back to the water, but Ares seemed to know what I wanted. He outmaneuvered me, pressing so hard
            I had to put all my concentration on not getting sliced into pieces. I kept backing away from the
            surf. I couldn‚Äôt find any openings to attack. His sword had a reach several feet longer than
            Anaklusmos.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Get in close,</i> Luke told me once, back in our sword class.
            <i class="calibre7">When you‚Äôve got the shorter blade, get in close.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stepped inside with a thrust, but Ares was waiting for that. He knocked my blade
            out of my hands and kicked me in the chest. I went airborne&mdash; twenty, maybe thirty feet. I
            would‚Äôve broken my back if I hadn‚Äôt crashed into the soft sand of a dune.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy!‚Äù Annabeth yelled. ‚ÄúCops!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was seeing double. My chest felt like it had just been hit with a battering ram,
            but I managed to get to my feet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt look away from Ares for fear he‚Äôd slice me in half, but out of the
            corner of my eye I saw red lights flashing on the shoreline boulevard. Car doors were slamming.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThere, officer!‚Äù somebody yelled. ‚ÄúSee?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A gruff cop voice: ‚ÄúLooks like that kid on TV‚Ä¶what the heck‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat guy‚Äôs armed,‚Äù another cop said. ‚ÄúCall for backup.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I rolled to one side as Ares‚Äôs blade slashed the sand.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I ran for my sword, scooped it up, and launched a swipe at Ares‚Äôs face, only to
            find my blade deflected again.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares seemed to know exactly what I was going to do the moment before I did it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stepped back toward the surf, forcing him to follow.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-327" class="calibre17">‚ÄúAdmit it, kid,‚Äù Ares said. ‚ÄúYou got no hope. I‚Äôm just toying
            with you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My senses were working overtime. I now understood what Annabeth had said about ADHD
            keeping you alive in battle. I was wide awake, noticing every little detail.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I could see where Ares was tensing. I could tell which way he would strike. At the
            same time, I was aware of Annabeth and Grover, thirty feet to my left. I saw a second cop car
            pulling up, siren wailing. Spectators, people who had been wandering the streets because of the
            earthquake, were starting to gather. Among the crowd, I thought I saw a few who were walking with
            the strange, trotting gait of disguised satyrs. There were shimmering forms of spirits, too, as if
            the dead had risen from Hades to watch the battle. I heard the flap of leathery wings circling
            somewhere above.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">More sirens.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stepped farther into the water, but Ares was fast. The tip of his blade ripped my
            sleeve and grazed my forearm.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A police voice on a megaphone said, ‚ÄúDrop the guns! Set them on the ground. Now!‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Guns?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at Ares‚Äôs weapon, and it seemed to be flickering; sometimes it looked like
            a shotgun, sometimes a two-handed sword. I didn‚Äôt know what the humans were seeing in my hands, but
            I was pretty sure it wouldn‚Äôt make them like me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares turned to glare at our spectators, which gave me a moment to breathe. There
            were five police cars now, and a line of officers crouching behind them, pistols trained on us.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis is a private matter!‚Äù Ares bellowed. ‚ÄúBe gone!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He swept his hand, and a wall of red flame rolled across the patrol cars. The
            police barely had time to dive for cover before their vehicles exploded. The crowd behind them
            scattered, screaming.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares roared with laughter. ‚ÄúNow, little hero. Let‚Äôs add you to the barbecue.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He slashed. I deflected his blade. I got close enough to strike, tried to fake him
            out with a feint, but my blow was knocked aside. The waves were hitting me in the back now. Ares was
            up to his thighs, wading in after me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I felt the rhythm of the sea, the waves growing larger as the tide rolled in, and
            suddenly I had an idea. <i class="calibre7">Little waves</i>, I thought. And the water behind me
            seemed to recede. I was holding back the tide by force of will, but tension was building, like
            carbonation behind a cork.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-328" class="calibre17">Ares came toward me, grinning confidently. I lowered my
            blade, as if I were too exhausted to go on. <i class="calibre7">Wait for it,</i> I told the sea. The
            pressure now was almost lifting me off my feet. Ares raised his sword. I released the tide and
            jumped, rocketing straight over Ares on a wave.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A six-foot wall of water smashed him full in the face, leaving him cursing and
            sputtering with a mouth full of seaweed. I landed behind him with a splash and feinted toward his
            head, as I‚Äôd done before. He turned in time to raise his sword, but this time he was disoriented, he
            didn‚Äôt anticipate the trick. I changed direction, lunged to the side, and stabbed Riptide straight
            down into the water, sending the point through the god‚Äôs heel.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The roar that followed made Hades‚Äôs earthquake look like a minor event. The very
            sea was blasted back from Ares, leaving a wet circle of sand fifty feet wide.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ichor, the golden blood of the gods, flowed from a gash in the war god‚Äôs boot. The
            expression on his face was beyond hatred. It was pain, shock, complete disbelief that he‚Äôd been
            wounded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He limped toward me, muttering ancient Greek curses.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Something stopped him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was as if a cloud covered the sun, but worse. Light faded. Sound and color
            drained away. A cold, heavy presence passed over the beach, slowing time, dropping the temperature
            to freezing, and making me feel like life was hopeless, fighting was useless.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The darkness lifted.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares looked stunned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Police cars were burning behind us. The crowd of spectators had fled. Annabeth and
            Grover stood on the beach, in shock, watching the water flood back around Ares‚Äôs feet, his glowing
            golden ichor dissipating in the tide.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Ares lowered his sword.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou have made an enemy, godling,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúYou have sealed your fate. Every
            time you raise your blade in battle, every time you hope for success, you will feel my curse.
            Beware, Perseus Jackson. Beware.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His body began to glow.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy!‚Äù Annabeth shouted. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt watch!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned away as the god Ares revealed his true immortal form. I somehow knew that
            if I looked, I would disintegrate into ashes.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-329" class="calibre17">The light died.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked back. Ares was gone. The tide rolled out to reveal Hades‚Äôs bronze helm of
            darkness. I picked it up and walked toward my friends.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But before I got there, I heard the flapping of leathery wings. Three evil-looking
            grandmothers with lace hats and fiery whips drifted down from the sky and landed in front of me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The middle Fury, the one who had been Mrs. Dodds, stepped forward. Her fangs were
            bared, but for once she didn‚Äôt look threatening. She looked more disappointed, as if she‚Äôd been
            planning to have me for supper, but had decided I might give her indigestion.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe saw the whole thing,‚Äù she hissed. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶it truly was not you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tossed her the helmet, which she caught in surprise.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúReturn that to Lord Hades,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTell him the truth. Tell him to call off the
            war.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She hesitated, then ran a forked tongue over her green, leathery lips. ‚ÄúLive well,
            Percy Jackson. Become a true hero. Because if you do not, if you ever come into my clutches again‚Ä¶‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">She cackled, savoring the idea. Then she and her sisters rose on their bats‚Äô wings,
            fluttered into the smoke-filled sky, and disappeared.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I joined Grover and Annabeth, who were staring at me in amazement.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy‚Ä¶‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúThat was so incredibly‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTerrifying,‚Äù said Annabeth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCool!‚Äù Grover corrected.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-330" class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt feel terrified. I certainly didn‚Äôt feel cool. I was
            tired and sore and completely drained of energy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDid you guys feel that‚Ä¶whatever it was?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They both nodded uneasily.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been the Furies overhead,‚Äù Grover said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But I wasn‚Äôt so sure. Something had stopped Ares from killing me, and whatever
            could do that was a lot stronger than the Furies.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at Annabeth, and an understanding passed between us. I knew now what was
            in that pit, what had spoken from the entrance of Tartarus.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I reclaimed my backpack from Grover and looked inside. The master bolt was still
            there. Such a small thing to almost cause World War III.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe have to get back to New York,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBy tonight.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible,‚Äù Annabeth said, ‚Äúunless we&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFly,‚Äù I agreed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She stared at me. ‚ÄúFly, like, in an airplane, which you were warned never to do
            lest Zeus strike you out of the sky, <i class="calibre7">and</i> carrying a weapon that has more
            destructive power than a nuclear bomb?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúPretty much exactly like that. Come on.‚Äù</p>

              HUMANS CAN WRAP THEIR</span> mind around things and fit them into their version of reality.
            Chiron had told me that long ago. As usual, I didn‚Äôt appreciate his wisdom until much later.</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre17">According to the L.A. news, the explosion at the Santa Monica beach had been caused
            when a crazy kidnapper fired a shotgun at a police car. He accidentally hit a gas main that had
            ruptured during the earthquake.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">This crazy kidnapper (a.k.a. Ares) was the same man who had abducted me and two
            other adolescents in New York and brought us across the country on a ten-day odyssey of terror.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Poor little Percy Jackson wasn‚Äôt an international criminal after all. He‚Äôd caused a
            commotion on that Greyhound bus in New Jersey trying to get away from his captor (and afterward,
            witnesses would even swear they had seen the leather-clad man on the bus&mdash;‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I
            remember him before?‚Äù). The crazy man had caused the explosion in the St. Louis Arch. After all, no
            kid could‚Äôve done that. A concerned waitress in Denver had seen the man threatening his abductees
            outside her diner, gotten a friend to take a photo, and notified the police. Finally, brave Percy
            Jackson (I was beginning to like this kid) had stolen a gun from his captor in Los Angeles and
            battled him shotgun-to-rifle on the beach. Police had arrived just in time. But in the spectacular
            explosion, five police cars had been destroyed and the captor had fled. No fatalities had occurred.
            Percy Jackson and his two friends were safely in police custody.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-331" class="calibre17">The reporters fed us this whole story. We just nodded and
            acted tearful and exhausted (which wasn‚Äôt hard), and played victimized kids for the cameras.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll I want,‚Äù I said, choking back my tears, ‚Äúis to see my loving stepfather again.
            Every time I saw him on TV, calling me a delinquent punk, I knew‚Ä¶somehow‚Ä¶we would be okay. And I
            know he‚Äôll want to reward each and every person in this beautiful city of Los Angeles with a free
            major appliance from his store. Here‚Äôs the phone number.‚Äù The police and reporters were so moved
            that they passed around the hat and raised money for three tickets on the next plane to New York.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I knew there was no choice but to fly. I hoped Zeus would cut me some slack,
            considering the circumstances. But it was still hard to force myself on board the flight.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Takeoff was a nightmare. Every spot of turbulence was scarier than a Greek monster.
            I didn‚Äôt unclench my hands from the armrests until we touched down safely at LaGuardia. The local
            press was waiting for us outside security, but we managed to evade them thanks to Annabeth, who
            lured them away in her invisible Yankees cap, shouting, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre over by the frozen yogurt! Come
            on!,‚Äù then rejoined us at baggage claim.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We split up at the taxi stand. I told Annabeth and Grover to get back to Half-Blood
            Hill and let Chiron know what had happened. They protested, and it was hard to let them go after all
            we‚Äôd been through, but I knew I had to do this last part of the quest by myself. If things went
            wrong, if the gods didn‚Äôt believe me‚Ä¶I wanted Annabeth and Grover to survive to tell Chiron the
            truth.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I hopped in a taxi and headed into Manhattan.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">Thirty minutes later, I walked into the lobby of the Empire State Building.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-332" class="calibre17">I must have looked like a homeless kid, with my tattered
            clothes and my scraped-up face. I hadn‚Äôt slept in at least twenty-four hours.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I went up to the guard at the front desk and said, ‚ÄúSix hundredth floor.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was reading a huge book with a picture of a wizard on the front. I wasn‚Äôt much
            into fantasy, but the book must‚Äôve been good, because the guard took a while to look up. ‚ÄúNo such
            floor, kiddo.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI need an audience with Zeus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He gave me a vacant smile. ‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou heard me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was about to decide this guy was just a regular mortal, and I‚Äôd better run for it
            before he called the straitjacket patrol, when he said, ‚ÄúNo appointment, no audience, kiddo. Lord
            Zeus doesn‚Äôt see anyone unannounced.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, I think he‚Äôll make an exception.‚Äù I slipped off my backpack and unzipped the
            top.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The guard looked inside at the metal cylinder, not getting what it was for a few
            seconds. Then his face went pale. ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, it is,‚Äù I promised. ‚ÄúYou want me to take it out and&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo! No!‚Äù He scrambled out of his seat, fumbled around his desk for a key card,
            then handed it to me. ‚ÄúInsert this in the security slot. Make sure nobody else is in the elevator
            with you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I did as he told me. As soon as the elevator doors closed, I slipped the key into
            the slot. The card disappeared and a new button appeared on the console, a red one that said 600.
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-334" class="calibre17">I pressed it and waited, and waited.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Muzak played. ‚ÄúRaindrops keep falling on my head‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, <i class="calibre7">ding</i>. The doors slid open. I stepped out and
            almost had a heart attack.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was standing on a narrow stone walkway in the middle of the air. Below me was
            Manhattan, from the height of an airplane. In front of me, white marble steps wound up the spine of
            a cloud, into the sky. My eyes followed the stairway to its end, where my brain just could not
            accept what I saw.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Look again, my brain said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We‚Äôre looking, my eyes insisted. It‚Äôs really there.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">From the top of the clouds rose the decapitated peak of a mountain, its summit
            covered with snow. Clinging to the mountainside were dozens of multileveled palaces&mdash;a city of
            mansions&mdash;all with white-columned porticos, gilded terraces, and bronze braziers glowing with a
            thousand fires. Roads wound crazily up to the peak, where the largest palace gleamed against the
            snow. Precariously perched gardens bloomed with olive trees and rosebushes. I could make out an
            open-air market filled with colorful tents, a stone amphitheater built on one side of the mountain,
            a hippodrome and a coliseum on the other. It was an ancient Greek city, except it wasn‚Äôt in ruins.
            It was new, and clean, and colorful, the way Athens must‚Äôve looked twenty-five hundred years ago.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">This place can‚Äôt be here, I told myself. The tip of a mountain hanging over New
            York City like a billion-ton asteroid? How could something like that be anchored above the Empire
            State Building, in plain sight of millions of people, and not get noticed?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But here it was. And here I was.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My trip through Olympus was a daze. I passed some giggling wood nymphs who threw
            olives at me from their garden. Hawkers in the market offered to sell me ambrosia-on-a-stick, and a
            new shield, and a genuine glitter-weave replica of the Golden Fleece, as seen on Hephaestus-TV. The
            nine muses were tuning their instruments for a concert in the park while a small crowd
            gathered&mdash;satyrs and naiads and a bunch of good-looking teenagers who might‚Äôve been minor gods
            and goddesses. Nobody seemed worried about an impending civil war. In fact, everybody seemed in a
            festive mood. Several of them turned to watch me pass, and whispered to themselves.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-335" class="calibre17">I climbed the main road, toward the big palace at the peak.
            It was a reverse copy of the palace in the Underworld. There, everything had been black and bronze.
            Here, everything glittered white and silver.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I realized Hades must‚Äôve built his palace to resemble this one. He wasn‚Äôt welcomed
            in Olympus except on the winter solstice, so he‚Äôd built his own Olympus underground. Despite my bad
            experience with him, I felt a little sorry for the guy. To be banished from this place seemed really
            unfair. It would make anybody bitter.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Steps led up to a central courtyard. Past that, the throne room.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Room</i> really isn‚Äôt the right word. The place made Grand
            Central Station look like a broom closet. Massive columns rose to a domed ceiling, which was gilded
            with moving constellations.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Twelve thrones, built for beings the size of Hades, were arranged in an inverted U,
            just like the cabins at Camp Half-Blood. An enormous fire crackled in the central hearth pit. The
            thrones were empty except for two at the end: the head throne on the right, and the one to its
            immediate left. I didn‚Äôt have to be told who the two gods were that were sitting there, waiting for
            me to approach. I came toward them, my legs trembling.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The gods were in giant human form, as Hades had been, but I could barely look at
            them without feeling a tingle, as if my body were starting to burn. Zeus, the Lord of the Gods, wore
            a dark blue pinstriped suit. He sat on a simple throne of solid platinum. He had a well-trimmed
            beard, marbled gray and black like a storm cloud. His face was proud and handsome and grim, his eyes
            rainy gray. As I got nearer to him, the air crackled and smelled of ozone.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-337" class="calibre17">The god sitting next to him was his brother, without a doubt,
            but he was dressed very differently. He reminded me of a beachcomber from Key West. He wore leather
            sandals, khaki Bermuda shorts, and a Tommy Bahama shirt with coconuts and parrots all over it. His
            skin was deeply tanned, his hands scarred like an old-time fisherman‚Äôs. His hair was dark, like
            mine. His face had the same brooding look that had always gotten me branded as a rebel. But his
            eyes, sea-green like mine, were surrounded by sun-crinkles that told me he smiled a lot, too.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His throne was a deep-sea fisherman‚Äôs chair. It was a simple swiveling kind, with a
            black leather seat and a built-in holster for a fishing pole. Instead of a pole, the holster held a
            bronze trident, flickering with green light around the tips.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-339" class="calibre17">The gods weren‚Äôt moving or speaking, but there was tension in
            the air, as if they‚Äôd just finished an argument.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I approached the fisherman‚Äôs throne and knelt at his feet. ‚ÄúFather.‚Äù I dared not
            look up. My heart was racing. I could feel the energy emanating from the two gods. If I said the
            wrong thing, I had no doubt they could blast me into dust.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">To my left, Zeus spoke. ‚ÄúShould you not address the master of this house first,
            boy?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I kept my head down, and waited.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPeace, brother,‚Äù Poseidon finally said. His voice stirred my oldest memories: that
            warm glow I remembered as a baby, the sensation of this god‚Äôs hand on my forehead. ‚ÄúThe boy defers
            to his father. This is only right.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou still claim him then?‚Äù Zeus asked, menacingly. ‚ÄúYou claim this child whom you
            sired against our sacred oath?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI have admitted my wrongdoing,‚Äù Poseidon said. ‚ÄúNow I would hear him speak.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Wrongdoing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A lump welled up in my throat. Was that all I was? A wrongdoing? The result of a
            god‚Äôs mistake?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI have spared him once already,‚Äù Zeus grumbled. ‚ÄúDaring to fly through my
            domain‚Ä¶pah! I should have blasted him out of the sky for his impudence.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd risk destoying your own master bolt?‚Äù Poseidon asked calmly. ‚ÄúLet us hear him
            out, brother.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Zeus grumbled some more. ‚ÄúI shall listen,‚Äù he decided. ‚ÄúThen I shall make up my
            mind whether or not to cast this boy down from Olympus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPerseus,‚Äù Poseidon said. ‚ÄúLook at me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I did, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what I saw in his face. There was no clear sign of love or
            approval. Nothing to encourage me. It was like looking at the ocean: some days you could tell what
            mood it was in. Most days, though, it was unreadable, mysterious.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got the feeling Poseidon really didn‚Äôt know what to think of me. He didn‚Äôt know
            whether he was happy to have me as a son or not. In a strange way, I was glad that Poseidon was so
            distant. If he‚Äôd tried to apologize, or told me he loved me, or even smiled, it would‚Äôve felt fake.
            Like a human dad, making some lame excuse for not being around. I could live with that. After all, I
            wasn‚Äôt sure about him yet, either.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-340" class="calibre17">‚ÄúAddress Lord Zeus, boy,‚Äù Poseidon told me. ‚ÄúTell him your
            story.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">So I told Zeus everything, just as it had happened. I took out the metal cylinder,
            which began sparking in the Sky God‚Äôs presence, and laid it at his feet.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">There was a long silence, broken only by the crackle of the hearth fire.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Zeus opened his palm. The lightning bolt flew into it. As he closed his fist, the
            metallic points flared with electricity, until he was holding what looked more like the classic
            thunderbolt, a twenty-foot javelin of arcing, hissing energy that made the hairs on my scalp rise.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI sense the boy tells the truth,‚Äù Zeus muttered. ‚ÄúBut that Ares would do such a
            thing‚Ä¶it is most unlike him.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe is proud and impulsive,‚Äù Poseidon said. ‚ÄúIt runs in the family.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLord?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They both said, ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAres didn‚Äôt act alone. Someone else&mdash;something else&mdash;came up with the
            idea.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I described my dreams, and the feeling I‚Äôd had on the beach, that momentary breath
            of evil that had seemed to stop the world, and made Ares back off from killing me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIn the dreams,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthe voice told me to bring the bolt to the Underworld.
            Ares hinted that he‚Äôd been having dreams, too. I think he was being used, just as I was, to start a
            war.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou are accusing Hades, after all?‚Äù Zeus asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI mean, Lord Zeus, I‚Äôve been in the presence of Hades. This feeling
            on the beach was different. It was the same thing I felt when I got close to that pit. That was the
            entrance to Tartarus, wasn‚Äôt it? Something powerful and evil is stirring down there‚Ä¶something even
            older than the gods.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Poseidon and Zeus looked at each other. They had a quick, intense discussion in
            ancient Greek. I only caught one word. <i class="calibre7">Father</i>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Poseidon made some kind of suggestion, but Zeus cut him off. Poseidon tried to
            argue. Zeus held up his hand angrily. ‚ÄúWe will speak of this no more,‚Äù Zeus said. ‚ÄúI must go
            personally to purify this thunderbolt in the waters of Lemnos, to remove the human taint from its
            metal.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He rose and looked at me. His expression softened just a fraction of a degree. ‚ÄúYou
            have done me a service, boy. Few heroes could have accomplished as much.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-341" class="calibre17">‚ÄúI had help, sir,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGrover Underwood and Annabeth
            Chase&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTo show you my thanks, I shall spare your life. I do not trust you, Perseus
            Jackson. I do not like what your arrival means for the future of Olympus. But for the sake of peace
            in the family, I shall let you live.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶thank you, sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDo not presume to fly again. Do not let me find you here when I return. Otherwise
            you shall taste this bolt. And it shall be your last sensation.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Thunder shook the palace. With a blinding flash of lightning, Zeus was gone.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was alone in the throne room with my father.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour uncle,‚Äù Poseidon sighed, ‚Äúhas always had a flair for dramatic exits. I think
            he would‚Äôve done well as the god of theater.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">An uncomfortable silence.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhat was in that pit?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Poseidon regarded me. ‚ÄúHave you not guessed?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúKronos,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe king of the Titans.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Even in the throne room of Olympus, far away from Tartarus, the name <i
              class="calibre7">Kronos</i> darkened the room, made the hearth fire seem not quite so warm on my
            back.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Poseidon gripped his trident. ‚ÄúIn the First War, Percy, Zeus cut our father Kronos
            into a thousand pieces, just as Kronos had done to his own father, Ouranos. Zeus cast Kronos‚Äôs
            remains into the darkest pit of Tartarus. The Titan army was scattered, their mountain fortress on
            Etna destroyed, their monstrous allies driven to the farthest corners of the earth. And yet Titans
            cannot die, any more than we gods can. Whatever is left of Kronos is still alive in some hideous
            way, still conscious in his eternal pain, still hungering for power.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs healing,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming back.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Poseidon shook his head. ‚ÄúFrom time to time, over the eons, Kronos has stirred. He
            enters men‚Äôs nightmares and breathes evil thoughts. He wakens restless monsters from the depths. But
            to suggest he could rise from the pit is another thing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what he intends, Father. That‚Äôs what he said.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Poseidon was silent for a long time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLord Zeus has closed discussion on this matter. He will not allow talk of Kronos.
            You have completed your quest, child. That is all you need to do.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-342" class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù I stopped myself. Arguing would do no good. It
            would very possibly anger the only god who I had on my side. ‚ÄúAs‚Ä¶as you wish, Father.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A faint smile played on his lips. ‚ÄúObedience does not come naturally to you, does
            it?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶sir.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI must take some blame for that, I suppose. The sea does not like to be
            restrained.‚Äù He rose to his full height and took up his trident. Then he shimmered and became the
            size of a regular man, standing directly in front of me. ‚ÄúYou must go, child. But first, know that
            your mother has returned.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at him, completely stunned. ‚ÄúMy mother?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou will find her at home. Hades sent her when you recovered his helm. Even the
            Lord of Death pays his debts.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My heart was pounding. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. ‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶would you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I wanted to ask if Poseidon would come with me to see her, but then I realized that
            was ridiculous. I imagined loading the God of the Sea into a taxi and taking him to the Upper East
            Side. If he‚Äôd wanted to see my mom all these years, he would have. And there was Smelly Gabe to
            think about.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Poseidon‚Äôs eyes took on a little sadness. ‚ÄúWhen you return home, Percy, you must
            make an important choice. You will find a package waiting in your room.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA package?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou will understand when you see it. No one can choose your path, Percy. You must
            decide.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I nodded, though I didn‚Äôt know what he meant.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour mother is a queen among women,‚Äù Poseidon said wistfully. ‚ÄúI had not met such
            a mortal woman in a thousand years. Still‚Ä¶I am sorry you were born, child. I have brought you a
            hero‚Äôs fate, and a hero‚Äôs fate is never happy. It is never anything but tragic.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried not to feel hurt. Here was my own dad, telling me he was sorry I‚Äôd been
            born. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind, Father.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNot yet, perhaps,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot yet. But it was an unforgivable mistake on my
            part.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you then.‚Äù I bowed awkwardly. ‚ÄúI&mdash;I won‚Äôt bother you again.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was five steps away when he called, ‚ÄúPerseus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I turned.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-343" class="calibre17">There was a different light in his eyes, a fiery kind of
            pride. ‚ÄúYou did well, Perseus. Do not misunderstand me. Whatever else you do, know that you are
            mine. You are a true son of the Sea God.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As I walked back through the city of the gods, conversations stopped. The muses
            paused their concert. People and satyrs and naiads all turned toward me, their faces filled with
            respect and gratitude, and as I passed, they knelt, as if I were some kind of hero.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1">Fifteen minutes later, still in a trance, I was back on the streets of Manhattan.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I caught a taxi to my mom‚Äôs apartment, rang the doorbell, and there she
            was&mdash;my beautiful mother, smelling of peppermint and licorice, the weariness and worry
            evaporating from her face as soon as she saw me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy! Oh, thank goodness. Oh, my baby.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She crushed the air right out of me. We stood in the hallway as she cried and ran
            her hands through my hair.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôll admit it&mdash;my eyes were a little misty, too. I was shaking, I was so
            relieved to see her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She told me she‚Äôd just appeared at the apartment that morning, scaring Gabe half
            out of his wits. She didn‚Äôt remember anything since the Minotaur, and couldn‚Äôt believe it when Gabe
            told her I was a wanted criminal, traveling across the country, blowing up national monuments. She‚Äôd
            been going out of her mind with worry all day because she hadn‚Äôt heard the news. Gabe had forced her
            to go into work, saying she had a month‚Äôs salary to make up and she‚Äôd better get started.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-345" class="calibre17">I swallowed back my anger and told her my own story. I tried
            to make it sound less scary than it had been, but that wasn‚Äôt easy. I was just getting to the fight
            with Ares when Gabe‚Äôs voice interrupted from the living room. ‚ÄúHey, Sally! That meat loaf done yet
            or what?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She closed her eyes. ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt going to be happy to see you, Percy. The store got
            half a million phone calls today from Los Angeles‚Ä¶something about free appliances.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, yeah. About that‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She managed a weak smile. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt make him angrier, all right? Come on.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">In the month I‚Äôd been gone, the apartment had turned into Gabeland. Garbage was
            ankle deep on the carpet. The sofa had been reupholstered in beer cans. Dirty socks and underwear
            hung off the lampshades.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe and three of his big goony friends were playing poker at the table.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">When Gabe saw me, his cigar dropped out of his mouth. His face got redder than
            lava. ‚ÄúYou got nerve coming here, you little punk. I thought the police&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a fugitive after all,‚Äù my mom interjected. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that wonderful, Gabe?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe looked back and forth between us. He didn‚Äôt seem to think my homecoming was so
            wonderful.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBad enough I had to give back your life insurance money, Sally,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúGet
            me the phone. I‚Äôll call the cops.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGabe, no!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He raised his eyebrows. ‚ÄúDid you just say ‚Äò<i class="calibre7">no</i>‚Äô? You think
            I‚Äôm gonna put up with this punk again? I can still press charges against him for ruining my Camaro.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He raised his hand, and my mother flinched.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For the first time, I realized something. Gabe had hit my mother. I didn‚Äôt know
            when, or how much. But I was sure he‚Äôd done it. Maybe it had been going on for years, when I wasn‚Äôt
            around.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-346" class="calibre17">A balloon of anger started expanding in my chest. I came
            toward Gabe, instinctively taking my pen out of my pocket.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He just laughed. ‚ÄúWhat, punk? You gonna write on me? You touch me, and you are
            going to jail forever, you understand?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, Gabe,‚Äù his friend Eddie interrupted. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a kid,‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Gabe looked at him resentfully and mimicked in a falsetto voice: <i
              class="calibre7">‚ÄúJust a kid.‚Äù</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">His other friends laughed like idiots.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll be nice to you, punk.‚Äù Gabe showed me his tobacco-stained teeth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give
            you five minutes to get your stuff and clear out. After that, I call the police.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGabe!‚Äù my mother pleaded.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe ran away,‚Äù Gabe told her. ‚ÄúLet him stay gone.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was itching to uncap Riptide, but even if I did, the blade wouldn‚Äôt hurt humans.
            And Gabe, by the loosest definition, was human.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My mother took my arm. ‚ÄúPlease, Percy. Come on. We‚Äôll go to your room.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I let her pull me away, my hands still trembling with rage.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My room had been completely filled with Gabe‚Äôs junk. There were stacks of used car
            batteries, a rotting bouquet of sympathy flowers with a card from somebody who‚Äôd seen his Barbara
            Walters interview.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGabe is just upset, honey,‚Äù my mother told me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to him later. I‚Äôm sure
            it will work out.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMom, it‚Äôll never work out. Not as long as Gabe‚Äôs here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She wrung her hands nervously. ‚ÄúI can‚Ä¶I‚Äôll take you to work with me for the rest of
            the summer. In the fall, maybe there‚Äôs another boarding school &mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMom.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She lowered her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying, Percy. I just‚Ä¶I need some time.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A package appeared on my bed. At least, I could‚Äôve sworn it hadn‚Äôt been there a
            moment before.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was a battered cardboard box about the right size to fit a basketball. The
            address on the mailing slip was in my own handwriting:</p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5"><i class="calibre7">The Gods</i></span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5"><i class="calibre7">Mount Olympus</i></span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5"><i class="calibre7">600th Floor, Empire State
                Building</i></span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5"><i class="calibre7">New York, NY</i></span></p>
          <p id="calibre_link-347" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5"><i class="calibre7">With best
                wishes,</i></span></p>
          <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5"><i class="calibre7">PERCY JACKSON</i></span></p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre17">Over the top in black marker, in a man‚Äôs clear, bold print, was the address of our
            apartment, and the words: <span class="calibre5">RETURN TO SENDER</span>.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Suddenly I understood what Poseidon had told me on Olympus.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A package. A decision.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Whatever else you do, know that you are mine. You are a true
              son of the Sea God.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at my mother. ‚ÄúMom, do you want Gabe gone?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy, it isn‚Äôt that simple. I&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMom, just tell me. That jerk has been hitting you. Do you want him gone or not?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">She hesitated, then nodded almost imperceptibly. ‚ÄúYes, Percy. I do. And I‚Äôm trying
            to get up my courage to tell him. But you can‚Äôt do this for me. You can‚Äôt solve my problems.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I looked at the box.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I <i class="calibre7">could</i> solve her problem. I wanted to slice that package
            open, plop it on the poker table, and take out what was inside. I could start my very own statue
            garden, right there in the living room.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That‚Äôs what a Greek hero would do in the stories, I thought. That‚Äôs what Gabe
            deserves.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">But a hero‚Äôs story always ended in tragedy. Poseidon had told me that.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I remembered the Underworld. I thought about Gabe‚Äôs spirit drifting forever in the
            Fields of Asphodel, or condemned to some hideous torture behind the barbed wire of the Fields of
            Punishment&mdash;an eternal poker game, sitting up to his waist in boiling oil listening to opera
            music. Did I have the right to send someone there? Even Gabe?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A month ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have hesitated. Now‚Ä¶</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI can do it,‚Äù I told my mom. ‚ÄúOne look inside this box, and he‚Äôll never bother you
            again.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She glanced at the package, and seemed to understand immediately. ‚ÄúNo, Percy,‚Äù she
            said, stepping away. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPoseidon called you a queen,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúHe said he hadn‚Äôt met a woman like you
            in a thousand years.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her cheeks flushed. ‚ÄúPercy&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou deserve better than this, Mom. You should go to college, get your degree. You
            can write your novel, meet a nice guy maybe, live in a nice house. You don‚Äôt need to protect me
            anymore by staying with Gabe. Let me get rid of him.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-348" class="calibre17">She wiped a tear off her cheek. ‚ÄúYou sound so much like your
            father,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe offered to stop the tide for me once. He offered to build me a palace at the
            bottom of the sea. He thought he could solve all my problems with a wave of his hand.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with that?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Her multicolored eyes seemed to search inside me. ‚ÄúI think you know, Percy. I think
            you‚Äôre enough like me to understand. If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself.
            I can‚Äôt let a god take care of me‚Ä¶or my son. I have to‚Ä¶find the courage on my own. Your quest has
            reminded me of that.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We listened to the sound of poker chips and swearing, ESPN from the living room
            television.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave the box,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf he threatens you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She looked pale, but she nodded. ‚ÄúWhere will you go, Percy?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHalf-Blood Hill.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFor the summer‚Ä¶or forever?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI guess that depends.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We locked eyes, and I sensed that we had an agreement. We would see how things
            stood at the end of the summer.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She kissed my forehead. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be a hero, Percy. You‚Äôll be the greatest of all.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I took one last look around my bedroom. I had a feeling I‚Äôd never see it again.
            Then I walked with my mother to the front door.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLeaving so soon, punk?‚Äù Gabe called after me. ‚ÄúGood riddance.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I had one last twinge of doubt. How could I turn down the perfect chance to take
            revenge on him? I was leaving here without saving my mother.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, Sally,‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúWhat about that meat loaf, huh?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A steely look of anger flared in my mother‚Äôs eyes, and I thought, just maybe, I was
            leaving her in good hands after all. Her own.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe meat loaf is coming right up, dear,‚Äù she told Gabe. ‚ÄúMeat loaf surprise.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She looked at me, and winked.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-350" class="calibre17">The last thing I saw as the door swung closed was my mother
            staring at Gabe, as if she were contemplating how he would look as a garden statue.</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 22: THE PROPHECY COMES TRUE</h2>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                    class="calibre12">W</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">E WERE THE FIRST
              HEROES TO</span> return alive to Half-Blood Hill since Luke, so of course everybody treated us
            as if we‚Äôd won some reality-TV contest. According to camp tradition, we wore laurel wreaths to a big
            feast prepared in our honor, then led a procession down to the bonfire, where we got to burn the
            burial shrouds our cabins had made for us in our absence.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth‚Äôs shroud was so beautiful&mdash;gray silk with embroidered owls&mdash; I
            told her it seemed a shame not to bury her in it. She punched me and told me to shut up.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Being the son of Poseidon, I didn‚Äôt have any cabinmates, so the Ares cabin had
            volunteered to make my shroud. They‚Äôd taken an old bedsheet and painted smiley faces with X‚Äôed-out
            eyes around the border, and the word <span class="calibre5">LOSER</span> painted really big in the
            middle.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was fun to burn.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As Apollo‚Äôs cabin led the sing-along and passed out s‚Äômores, I was surrounded by my
            old Hermes cabinmates, Annabeth‚Äôs friends from Athena, and Grover‚Äôs satyr buddies, who were admiring
            the brand-new searcher‚Äôs license he‚Äôd received from the Council of Cloven Elders. The council had
            called Grover‚Äôs performance on the quest ‚ÄúBrave to the point of indigestion. Horns-and-whiskers
            above anything we have seen in the past.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-351" class="calibre17">The only ones not in a party mood were Clarisse and her
            cabinmates, whose poisonous looks told me they‚Äôd never forgive me for disgracing their dad.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">That was okay with me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Even Dionysus‚Äôs welcome-home speech wasn‚Äôt enough to dampen my spirits. ‚ÄúYes, yes,
            so the little brat didn‚Äôt get himself killed and now he‚Äôll have an even bigger head. Well, huzzah
            for that. In other announcements, there will be <i class="calibre7">no</i> canoe races this
            Saturday‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I moved back into cabin three, but it didn‚Äôt feel so lonely anymore. I had my
            friends to train with during the day. At night, I lay awake and listened to the sea, knowing my
            father was out there. Maybe he wasn‚Äôt quite sure about me yet, maybe he hadn‚Äôt even wanted me born,
            but he was watching. And so far, he was proud of what I‚Äôd done.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As for my mother, she had a chance at a new life. Her letter arrived a week after I
            got back to camp. She told me Gabe had left mysteriously&mdash; disappeared off the face of the
            planet, in fact. She‚Äôd reported him missing to the police, but she had a funny feeling they would
            never find him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">On a completely unrelated subject, she‚Äôd sold her first life-size concrete
            sculpture, entitled <i class="calibre7">The Poker Player</i>, to a collector, through an art gallery
            in Soho. She‚Äôd gotten so much money for it, she‚Äôd put a deposit down on a new apartment and made a
            payment on her first semester‚Äôs tuition at NYU. The Soho gallery was clamoring for more of her work,
            which they called ‚Äúa huge step forward in super-ugly neorealism.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-353" class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">But don‚Äôt worry,</i> my mom wrote. <i
              class="calibre7">I‚Äôm done with sculpture. I‚Äôve disposed of that box of tools you left me. It‚Äôs
              time for me to turn to writing.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">At the bottom, she wrote a P.S.: <i class="calibre7">Percy, I‚Äôve found a good
              private school here in the city. I‚Äôve put a deposit down to hold you a spot, in case you want to
              enroll for seventh grade. You could live at home. But if you want to go year-round at Half-Blood
              Hill, I‚Äôll understand.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I folded the note carefully and set it on my bedside table. Every night before I
            went to sleep, I read it again, and I tried to decide how to answer her.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">On the Fourth of July, the whole camp gathered at the beach for a fireworks display
            by cabin nine. Being Hephaestus‚Äôs kids, they weren‚Äôt going to settle for a few lame
            red-white-and-blue explosions. They‚Äôd anchored a barge offshore and loaded it with rockets the size
            of Patriot missiles. According to Annabeth, who‚Äôd seen the show before, the blasts would be
            sequenced so tightly they‚Äôd look like frames of animation across the sky. The finale was supposed to
            be a couple of hundred-foot-tall Spartan warriors who would crackle to life above the ocean, fight a
            battle, then explode into a million colors.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket, Grover showed up to tell us
            good-bye. He was dressed in his usual jeans and T-shirt and sneakers, but in the last few weeks he‚Äôd
            started to look older, almost high-school age. His goatee had gotten thicker. He‚Äôd put on weight.
            His horns had grown at least an inch, so he now had to wear his rasta cap all the time to pass as
            human.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm off,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just came to say‚Ä¶well, you know.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to feel happy for him. After all, it wasn‚Äôt every day a satyr got
            permission to go look for the great god Pan. But it was hard saying good-bye. I‚Äôd only known Grover
            a year, yet he was my oldest friend.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth gave him a hug. She told him to keep his fake feet on.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I asked him where he was going to search first.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúKind of a secret,‚Äù he said, looking embarrassed. ‚ÄúI wish you could come with me,
            guys, but humans and Pan‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe understand,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúYou got enough tin cans for the trip?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd you remembered your reed pipes?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúJeez, Annabeth,‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like an old mama goat.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-354" class="calibre17">But he didn‚Äôt really sound annoyed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He gripped his walking stick and slung a backpack over his shoulder. He looked like
            any hitchhiker you might see on an American highway&mdash;nothing like the little runty boy I used
            to defend from bullies at Yancy Academy.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwish me luck.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He gave Annabeth another hug. He clapped me on the shoulder, then headed back
            through the dunes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Fireworks exploded to life overhead: Hercules killing the Nemean lion, Artemis
            chasing the boar, George Washington (who, by the way, was a son of Athena) crossing the Delaware.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHey, Grover,‚Äù I called.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He turned at the edge of the woods.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWherever you‚Äôre going&mdash;I hope they make good enchiladas.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Grover grinned, and then he was gone, the trees closing around him.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see him again,‚Äù Annabeth said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I tried to believe it. The fact that no searcher had ever come back in two thousand
            years‚Ä¶well, I decided not to think about that. Grover would be the first. He had to be.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">July passed.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I spent my days devising new strategies for capture the flag and making alliances
            with the other cabins to keep the banner out of Ares‚Äôs hands. I got to the top of the climbing wall
            for the first time without getting scorched by lava.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">From time to time, I‚Äôd walk past the Big House, glance up at the attic windows, and
            think about the Oracle. I tried to convince myself that its prophecy had come to completion.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">You shall go west, and face the god who has turned.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">Been there, done that&mdash;even though the traitor god had turned out to be Ares
            rather than Hades.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Check. One master bolt delivered. One helm of darkness back on Hades‚Äôs oily head.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">This line still bothered me. Ares had pretended to be my friend, then betrayed me.
            That must be what the Oracle meant‚Ä¶.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.</i>
          </p>
          <p id="calibre_link-355" class="calibre17">I had failed to save my mom, but only because I‚Äôd let her
            save herself, and I knew that was the right thing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">So why was I still uneasy?</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The last night of the summer session came all too quickly.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The campers had one last meal together. We burned part of our dinner for the gods.
            At the bonfire, the senior counselors awarded the end-of-summer beads.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-357" class="calibre17">I got my own leather necklace, and when I saw the bead for my
            first summer, I was glad the firelight covered my blushing. The design was pitch black, with a
            sea-green trident shimmering in the center.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe choice was unanimous,‚Äù Luke announced. ‚ÄúThis bead commemorates the first Son
            of the Sea God at this camp, and the quest he undertook into the darkest part of the Underworld to
            stop a war!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The entire camp got to their feet and cheered. Even Ares‚Äôs cabin felt obliged to
            stand. Athena‚Äôs cabin steered Annabeth to the front so she could share in the applause.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd ever felt as happy or sad as I did at that moment. I‚Äôd finally
            found a family, people who cared about me and thought I‚Äôd done something right. And in the morning,
            most of them would be leaving for the year.</p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">The next morning, I found a form letter on my bedside table.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I knew Dionysus must‚Äôve filled it out, because he stubbornly insisted on getting my
            name wrong:</p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre6">Dear <i class="calibre7"><b class="calibre50">Peter
                Johnson</b></i>,</p>
          <p class="calibre3">If you intend to stay at Camp Half-Blood year-round, you must</p>
          <p class="calibre6">inform the Big House by noon today. If you do not announce your</p>
          <p class="calibre6">intentions, we will assume you have vacated your cabin or died a</p>
          <p class="calibre6">horrible death. Cleaning harpies will begin work at sundown. They will</p>
          <p class="calibre6">be authorized to eat any unregistered campers. All personal articles left</p>
          <p class="calibre6">behind will be incinerated in the lava pit.</p>
          <p class="calibre51">Have a nice day!</p>
          <p class="calibre51">Mr. D (Dionysus)</p>
          <p class="calibre6">Camp Director, Olympian Council #12</p>
          <br>
          <p class="calibre17">That‚Äôs another thing about ADHD. Deadlines just aren‚Äôt real to me until I‚Äôm staring
            one in the face. Summer was over, and I still hadn‚Äôt answered my mother, or the camp, about whether
            I‚Äôd be staying. Now I had only a few hours to decide.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The decision should have been easy. I mean, nine months of hero training or sitting
            in a classroom&mdash;duh.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-358" class="calibre17">But there was my mom to consider. For the first time, I had
            the chance to live with her for a whole year, without Gabe. I had a chance to be at home and knock
            around the city in my free time. I remembered what Annabeth had said so long ago on our quest: <i
              class="calibre7">The real world is where the monsters are. That‚Äôs where you learn whether you‚Äôre
              any good or not.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about the fate of Thalia, daughter of Zeus. I wondered how many monsters
            would attack me if I left Half-Blood Hill. If I stayed in one place for a whole school year, without
            Chiron or my friends around to help me, would my mother and I even survive until the next summer?
            That was assuming the spelling tests and five-paragraph essays didn‚Äôt kill me. I decided I‚Äôd go down
            to the arena and do some sword practice. Maybe that would clear my head.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The campgrounds were mostly deserted, shimmering in the August heat. All the
            campers were in their cabins packing up, or running around with brooms and mops, getting ready for
            final inspection. Argus was helping some of the Aphrodite kids haul their Gucci suitcases and makeup
            kits over the hill, where the camp‚Äôs shuttle bus would be waiting to take them to the airport.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Don‚Äôt think about leaving yet, I told myself. Just train.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I got to the sword-fighters arena and found that Luke had had the same idea. His
            gym bag was plopped at the edge of the stage. He was working solo, whaling on battle dummies with a
            sword I‚Äôd never seen before. It must‚Äôve been a regular steel blade, because he was slashing the
            dummies‚Äô heads right off, stabbing through their straw-stuffed guts. His orange counselor‚Äôs shirt
            was dripping with sweat. His expression was so intense, his life might‚Äôve really been in danger. I
            watched, fascinated, as he disemboweled the whole row of dummies, hacking off limbs and basically
            reducing them to a pile of straw and armor.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">They were only dummies, but I still couldn‚Äôt help being awed by Luke‚Äôs skill. The
            guy was an incredible fighter. It made me wonder, again, how he possibly could‚Äôve failed at his
            quest.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Finally, he saw me, and stopped mid-swing. ‚ÄúPercy.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm, sorry,‚Äù I said, embarrassed. ‚ÄúI just&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù he said, lowering his sword. ‚ÄúJust doing some last-minute practice.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThose dummies won‚Äôt be bothering anybody anymore.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke shrugged. ‚ÄúWe build new ones every summer.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-359" class="calibre17">Now that his sword wasn‚Äôt swirling around, I could see
            something odd about it. The blade was two different types of metal&mdash;one edge bronze, the other
            steel.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke noticed me looking at it. ‚ÄúOh, this? New toy. This is Backbiter.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBackbiter?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke turned the blade in the light so it glinted wickedly. ‚ÄúOne side is celestial
            bronze. The other is tempered steel. Works on mortals and immortals both.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I thought about what Chiron had told me when I started my quest&mdash;that a hero
            should never harm mortals unless absolutely necessary.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know they could make weapons like that.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">They</i> probably can‚Äôt,‚Äù Luke agreed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of a kind.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">He gave me a tiny smile, then slid the sword into its scabbard. ‚ÄúListen, I was
            going to come looking for you. What do you say we go down to the woods one last time, look for
            something to fight?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I don‚Äôt know why I hesitated. I should‚Äôve felt relieved that Luke was being so
            friendly. Ever since I‚Äôd gotten back from the quest, he‚Äôd been acting a little distant. I was afraid
            he might resent me for all the attention I‚Äôd gotten.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a good idea?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI mean&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAw, come on.‚Äù He rummaged in his gym bag and pulled out a six-pack of Cokes.
            ‚ÄúDrinks are on me.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at the Cokes, wondering where the heck he‚Äôd gotten them. There were no
            regular mortal sodas at the camp store. No way to smuggle them in unless you talked to a satyr,
            maybe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Of course, the magic dinner goblets would fill with anything you want, but it just
            didn‚Äôt taste the same as a real Coke, straight out of the can.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Sugar and caffeine. My willpower crumbled.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I decided. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We walked down to the woods and kicked around for some kind of monster to fight,
            but it was too hot. All the monsters with any sense must‚Äôve been taking siestas in their nice cool
            caves.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">We found a shady spot by the creek where I‚Äôd broken Clarisse‚Äôs spear during my
            first capture the flag game. We sat on a big rock, drank our Cokes, and watched the sunlight in the
            woods.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">After a while Luke said, ‚ÄúYou miss being on a quest?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWith monsters attacking me every three feet? Are you kidding?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke raised an eyebrow.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-360" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah, I miss it,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">A shadow passed over his face.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was used to hearing from the girls how good-looking Luke was, but at the moment,
            he looked weary, and angry, and not at all handsome. His blond hair was gray in the sunlight. The
            scar on his face looked deeper than usual. I could imagine him as an old man.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived at Half-Blood Hill year-round since I was fourteen,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúEver
            since Thalia‚Ä¶well, you know. I trained, and trained, and trained. I never got to be a normal
            teenager, out there in the real world. Then they threw me one quest, and when I came back, it was
            like, ‚ÄòOkay, ride‚Äôs over. Have a nice life.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He crumpled his Coke can and threw it into the creek, which really shocked me. One
            of the first things you learn at Camp Half-Blood is: Don‚Äôt litter. You‚Äôll hear from the nymphs and
            the naiads. They‚Äôll get even. You‚Äôll crawl into bed one night and find your sheets filled with
            centipedes and mud.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe heck with laurel wreaths,‚Äù Luke said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to end up like those
            dusty trophies in the Big House attic.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou make it sound like you‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke gave me a twisted smile. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm leaving, all right, Percy. I brought you
            down here to say good-bye.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He snapped his fingers. A small fire burned a hole in the ground at my feet. Out
            crawled something glistening black, about the size of my hand. A scorpion.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I started to go for my pen.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù Luke cautioned. ‚ÄúPit scorpions can jump up to fifteen feet. Its
            stinger can pierce right through your clothes. You‚Äôll be dead in sixty seconds.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLuke, what&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then it hit me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">You will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.</i></p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He stood calmly and brushed off his jeans.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The scorpion paid him no attention. It kept its beady black eyes on me, clamping
            its pincers as it crawled onto my shoe.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI saw a lot out there in the world, Percy,‚Äù Luke said. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you feel it
            &mdash;the darkness gathering, the monsters growing stronger? Didn‚Äôt you realize how useless it all
            is? All the heroics&mdash;being pawns of the gods. They should‚Äôve been overthrown thousands of years
            ago, but they‚Äôve hung on, thanks to us half-bloods.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I couldn‚Äôt believe this was happening.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLuke‚Ä¶you‚Äôre talking about our parents,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs supposed to make me love them? Their precious ‚ÄòWestern
            civilization‚Äô is a disease, Percy. It‚Äôs killing the world. The only way to stop it is to burn it to
            the ground, start over with something more honest.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as crazy as Ares.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His eyes flared. ‚ÄúAres is a fool. He never realized the true master he was serving.
            If I had time, Percy, I could explain. But I‚Äôm afraid you won‚Äôt live that long.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The scorpion crawled onto my pants leg.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-362" class="calibre17">There had to be a way out of this. I needed time to think.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúKronos,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs who you serve.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The air got colder.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou should be careful with names,‚Äù Luke warned.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúKronos got you to steal the master bolt and the helm. He spoke to you in your
            dreams.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke‚Äôs eye twitched. ‚ÄúHe spoke to you, too, Percy. You should‚Äôve listened.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs brainwashing you, Luke.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong. He showed me that my talents are being wasted. You know what my
            quest was two years ago, Percy? My father, Hermes, wanted me to steal a golden apple from the Garden
            of the Hesperides and return it to Olympus. After all the training I‚Äôd done, <i class="calibre7">that</i>
            was the best he could think up.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an easy quest,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHercules did it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Luke said. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the glory in repeating what others have done? All
            the gods know how to do is replay their past. My heart wasn‚Äôt in it. The dragon in the garden gave
            me this‚Äù&mdash;he pointed angrily at his scar &mdash;‚Äúand when I came back, all I got was pity. I
            wanted to pull Olympus down stone by stone right then, but I bided my time. I began to dream of
            Kronos. He convinced me to steal something worthwhile, something no hero had ever had the courage to
            take. When we went on that winter-solstice field trip, while the other campers were asleep, I snuck
            into the throne room and took Zeus‚Äôs master bolt right from his chair. Hades‚Äôs helm of darkness,
            too. You wouldn‚Äôt believe how easy it was. The Olympians are so arrogant; they never dreamed someone
            would dare steal from them. Their security is horrible. I was halfway across New Jersey before I
            heard the storms rumbling, and I knew they‚Äôd discovered my theft.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">The scorpion was sitting on my knee now, staring at me with its glittering eyes. I
            tried to keep my voice level. ‚ÄúSo why didn‚Äôt you bring the items to Kronos?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke‚Äôs smile wavered. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I got overconfident. Zeus sent out his sons and daughters
            to find the stolen bolt&mdash;Artemis, Apollo, my father, Hermes. But it was Ares who caught me. I
            could have beaten him, but I wasn‚Äôt careful enough. He disarmed me, took the items of power,
            threatened to return them to Olympus and burn me alive. Then Kronos‚Äôs voice came to me and told me
            what to say. I put the idea in Ares‚Äôs head about a great war between the gods. I said all he had to
            do was hide the items away for a while and watch the others fight. Ares got a wicked gleam in his
            eyes. I knew he was hooked. He let me go, and I returned to Olympus before anyone noticed my
            absence.‚Äù Luke drew his new sword. He ran his thumb down the flat of the blade, as if he were
            hypnotized by its beauty. ‚ÄúAfterward, the Lord of the Titans‚Ä¶h-he punished me with nightmares. I
            swore not to fail again. Back at Camp Half-Blood, in my dreams, I was told that a second hero would
            arrive, one who could be tricked into taking the bolt and the helm the rest of the way&mdash;from
            Ares down to Tartarus.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-363" class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">You</i> summoned the hellhound, that
            night in the forest.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe had to make Chiron think the camp wasn‚Äôt safe for you, so he would start you on
            your quest. We had to confirm his fears that Hades was after you. And it worked.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe flying shoes were cursed,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey were supposed to drag me and the
            backpack into Tartarus.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd they would have, if you‚Äôd been wearing them. But you gave them to the satyr,
            which wasn‚Äôt part of the plan. Grover messes up everything he touches. He even confused the curse.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke looked down at the scorpion, which was now sitting on my thigh. ‚ÄúYou should
            have died in Tartarus, Percy. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll leave you with my little friend to set things
            right.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThalia gave her life to save you,‚Äù I said, gritting my teeth. ‚ÄúAnd this is how you
            repay her?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak of Thalia!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúThe gods <i class="calibre7">let</i> her die!
            That‚Äôs one of the many things they will pay for.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being used, Luke. You and Ares both. Don‚Äôt listen to Kronos.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">I‚Äôve</i> been used?‚Äù Luke‚Äôs voice turned shrill. ‚ÄúLook at
            yourself. What has your dad ever done for you? Kronos will rise. You‚Äôve only delayed his plans. He
            will cast the Olympians into Tartarus and drive humanity back to their caves. All except the
            strongest&mdash;the ones who serve him.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCall off the bug,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre so strong, fight me yourself.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Luke smiled. ‚ÄúNice try, Percy. But I‚Äôm not Ares. You can‚Äôt bait me. My lord is
            waiting, and he‚Äôs got plenty of quests for me to undertake.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLuke&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGood-bye, Percy. There is a new Golden Age coming. You won‚Äôt be part of it.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He slashed his sword in an arc and disappeared in a ripple of darkness.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-364" class="calibre17">The scorpion lunged.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I swatted it away with my hand and uncapped my sword. The thing jumped at me and I
            cut it in half in midair.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was about to congratulate myself until I looked down at my hand. My palm had a
            huge red welt, oozing and smoking with yellow guck. The thing had gotten me after all.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My ears pounded. My vision went foggy. The water, I thought. It healed me before.
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stumbled to the creek and submerged my hand, but nothing seemed to happen. The
            poison was too strong. My vision was getting dark. I could barely stand up.</p>
          <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Sixty seconds,</i> Luke had told me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I had to get back to camp. If I collapsed out here, my body would be dinner for a
            monster. Nobody would ever know what had happened.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">My legs felt like lead. My forehead was burning. I stumbled toward the camp, and
            the nymphs stirred from their trees.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHelp,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Two of them took my arms, pulling me along. I remember making it to the clearing, a
            counselor shouting for help, a centaur blowing a conch horn.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Then everything went black.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="calibre1">I woke with a drinking straw in my mouth. I was sipping something that tasted like
            liquid chocolate-chip cookies. Nectar.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I opened my eyes.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I was propped up in bed in the sickroom of the Big House, my right hand bandaged
            like a club. Argus stood guard in the corner. Annabeth sat next to me, holding my nectar glass and
            dabbing a washcloth on my forehead.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHere we are again,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou idiot,‚Äù Annabeth said, which is how I knew she was overjoyed to see me
            conscious. ‚ÄúYou were green and turning gray when we found you. If it weren‚Äôt for Chiron‚Äôs healing‚Ä¶‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNow, now,‚Äù Chiron‚Äôs voice said. ‚ÄúPercy‚Äôs constitution deserves some of the
            credit.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He was sitting near the foot of my bed in human form, which was why I hadn‚Äôt
            noticed him yet. His lower half was magically compacted into the wheelchair, his upper half dressed
            in a coat and tie. He smiled, but his face looked weary and pale, the way it did when he‚Äôd been up
            all night grading Latin papers.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù he asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLike my insides have been frozen, then microwaved.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúApt, considering that was pit scorpion venom. Now you must tell me, if you can,
            exactly what happened.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Between sips of nectar, I told them the story.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-366" class="calibre17">The room was quiet for a long time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that Luke‚Ä¶‚Äù Annabeth‚Äôs voice faltered. Her expression turned angry
            and said. ‚ÄúYes. Yes, I <i class="calibre7">can</i> believe it. May the gods curse him‚Ä¶.He was never
            the same after his quest.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThis must be reported to Olympus,‚Äù Chiron murmured. ‚ÄúI will go at once.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLuke is out there right now,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI have to go after him.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, Percy. The gods&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWon‚Äôt even <i class="calibre7">talk</i> about Kronos,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúZeus declared
            the matter closed!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy, I know this is hard. But you must not rush out for vengeance. You aren‚Äôt
            ready.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt like it, but part of me suspected Chiron was right. One look at my hand,
            and I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be sword fighting any time soon. ‚ÄúChiron‚Ä¶your prophecy from the
            Oracle‚Ä¶it was about Kronos, wasn‚Äôt it? Was I in it? And Annabeth?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron glanced nervously at the ceiling. ‚ÄúPercy, it isn‚Äôt my place&mdash;‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been ordered not to talk to me about it, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">His eyes were sympathetic, but sad. ‚ÄúYou will be a great hero, child. I will do my
            best to prepare you. But if I‚Äôm right about the path ahead of you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Thunder boomed overhead, rattling the windows.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll right!‚Äù Chiron shouted. ‚ÄúFine!‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He sighed in frustration. ‚ÄúThe gods have their reasons, Percy. Knowing too much of
            your future is never a good thing.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just sit back and do nothing,‚Äù I said.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚Äú<i class="calibre7">We</i> will not sit back,‚Äù Chiron promised. ‚ÄúBut <i
              class="calibre7">you</i> must be careful. Kronos wants you to come unraveled. He wants your life
            disrupted, your thoughts clouded with fear and anger. Do not give him what he wants. Train
            patiently. Your time will come.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAssuming I live that long.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron put his hand on my ankle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to trust me, Percy. You will live.
            But first you must decide your path for the coming year. I cannot tell you the right choice‚Ä¶.‚Äù I got
            the feeling that he had a very definite opinion, and it was taking all his willpower not to advise
            me. ‚ÄúBut you must decide whether to stay at Camp Half-Blood year-round, or return to the mortal
            world for seventh grade and be a summer camper. Think on that. When I get back from Olympus, you
            must tell me your decision.‚Äù</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-367" class="calibre17">I wanted to protest. I wanted to ask him more questions. But
            his expression told me there could be no more discussion; he had said as much as he could.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back as soon as I can,‚Äù Chiron promised. ‚ÄúArgus will watch over you.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">He glanced at Annabeth. ‚ÄúOh, and, my dear‚Ä¶whenever you‚Äôre ready, they‚Äôre here.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWho‚Äôs here?‚Äù I asked.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Nobody answered.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Chiron rolled himself out of the room. I heard the wheels of his chair clunk
            carefully down the front steps, two at a time.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth studied the ice in my drink.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked her.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù She set the glass on the table. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶just took your advice about
            something. You‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶need anything?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYeah. Help me up. I want to go outside.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy, that isn‚Äôt a good idea.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I slid my legs out of bed. Annabeth caught me before I could crumple to the floor.
            A wave of nausea rolled over me.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, ‚ÄúI told you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I insisted. I didn‚Äôt want to lie in bed like an invalid while Luke was
            out there planning to destroy the Western world.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I managed a step forward. Then another, still leaning heavily on Annabeth. Argus
            followed us outside, but he kept his distance.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">By the time we reached the porch, my face was beaded with sweat. My stomach had
            twisted into knots. But I had managed to make it all the way to the railing.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">It was dusk. The camp looked completely deserted. The cabins were dark and the
            volleyball pit silent. No canoes cut the surface of the lake. Beyond the woods and the strawberry
            fields, the Long Island Sound glittered in the last light of the sun.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù Annabeth asked me.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-369" class="calibre17">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I told her I got the feeling Chiron wanted me to stay year-round, to put in more
            individual training time, but I wasn‚Äôt sure that‚Äôs what I wanted. I admitted I‚Äôd feel bad about
            leaving her alone, though, with only Clarisse for company‚Ä¶.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">Annabeth pursed her lips, then said quietly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home for the year, Percy.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I stared at her. ‚ÄúYou mean, to your dad‚Äôs?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She pointed toward the crest of Half-Blood Hill. Next to Thalia‚Äôs pine tree, at the
            very edge of the camp‚Äôs magical boundaries, a family stood silhouetted&mdash;two little children, a
            woman, and a tall man with blond hair. They seemed to be waiting. The man was holding a backpack
            that looked like the one Annabeth had gotten from Waterland in Denver.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI wrote him a letter when we got back,‚Äù Annabeth said. ‚ÄúJust like you suggested. I
            told him‚Ä¶I was sorry. I‚Äôd come home for the school year if he still wanted me. He wrote back
            immediately. We decided‚Ä¶we‚Äôd give it another try.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat took guts.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She shrugged. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt try anything stupid during the school year, will you? At
            least‚Ä¶not without sending me an Iris-message?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I managed a smile. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt go looking for trouble. I usually don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhen I get back next summer,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll hunt down Luke. We‚Äôll ask for a
            quest, but if we don‚Äôt get approval, we‚Äôll sneak off and do it anyway. Agreed?‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSounds like a plan worthy of Athena.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">She held out her hand. I shook it.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTake care, Seaweed Brain,‚Äù Annabeth told me. ‚ÄúKeep your eyes open.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou too, Wise Girl.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="calibre17">I watched her walk up the hill and join her family. She gave her father an awkward
            hug and looked back at the valley one last time. She touched Thalia‚Äôs pine tree, then allowed
            herself to be led over the crest and into the mortal world.</p>
          <p class="calibre17">For the first time at camp, I felt truly alone. I looked out at Long Island Sound
            and I remembered my father saying, <i class="calibre7">The sea does not like to be restrained.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="calibre17">I made my decision.</p>
          <p id="calibre_link-370" class="calibre17">I wondered, if Poseidon were watching, would he approve of my
            choice?</p>
          <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back next summer,‚Äù I promised him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll survive until then. After all, I
            am your son.‚Äù I asked Argus to take me down to cabin three, so I could pack my bags for home.</p>

          <p>
          <p class="calibre1">Without the assistance of numerous valiant helpers, I would have been slain by
            monsters many times over as I endeavored to bring this story to print. Thanks to my elder son, Haley
            Michael, who heard the story first; my younger son, Patrick John, who at the age of six is the
            level-headed one in the family; and my wife, Becky, who puts up with my many long hours at Camp
            Half-Blood. Thanks also to my cadre of middle-school beta testers: Travis Stoll, clever and quick as
            Hermes; C. C. Kellogg, beloved as Athena; Allison Bauer, clear-eyed as Artemis the Huntress; and
