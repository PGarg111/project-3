                        When Claudia accidentally eavesdrops on the epic breakup of Paige and Iris, the it-couple at her school, she finds herself in hot water with prickly, difficult Iris. Thrown together against their will in the class production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, along with the goofiest, cutest boy Claudia has ever known, Iris and Claudia are in for an eye-opening senior year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Smart, funny, and thoroughly, wonderfully flawed, Claudia navigates a world of intense friendships and tentative romance in Emma Mills's Follish Hearts, a young adult novel about expanding your horizons, allowing yourself to be vulnerable, and accepting‚Äîand loving‚Äîpeople for who they really are.

                    <h2>one</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs at Amber Brunati‚Äôs annual Pink Party that everything begins to unravel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The invitation&mdash;on thick pink paper, naturally, with gold and turquoise
                        swirls&mdash;had declared it to be <i class="calibre13">the last great luncheon of the
                            summer.</i> As if my summer had been packed to bursting with a whole host of other themed
                        luncheons instead of babysitting jobs and shifts at Pinky‚Äôs Sub Shop. It also implied that there
                        had been a number of mediocre luncheons this summer, as this was meant to be the last of the <i
                            class="calibre13">great</i> ones.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stare around Amber‚Äôs backyard at clustered tables covered in pink gingham
                        cloths and at the girls around said tables. We‚Äôre all wearing pink except for Iris Huang, who
                        had the nerve to arrive in lavender (Amber‚Äôs angry whispers carried clear across the lawn), and
                        Kaitlyn Winthrop, who is technically wearing magenta. This seems to incense Amber even more,
                        because while we all know that Iris‚Äôs dress is a big official <i class="calibre13">eff you</i>
                        to the entire Pink Party construct, Kaitlyn doesn‚Äôt seem to realize that she‚Äôs committed a faux
                        pas.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSomeone get that girl a color wheel,‚Äù Amber hisses angrily to Madison Lutz,
                        sitting to my left. ‚ÄúSomeone get her a fucking Pantone booklet because magenta is not pink. We
                        all know magenta is not pink, right?‚Äù She looks to me. ‚ÄúRight?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAbso-tootin-lutely!‚Äù I declare loudly, because I am a moron.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a split second, and then a laugh escapes from Madison.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Amber doesn‚Äôt laugh, but her lips twitch in amusement. ‚ÄúYes. Good. Thank you,
                        Claudia. Glad we‚Äôre all on the same page.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">In truth, we are rarely all on the same page. More often than not, they‚Äôre all
                        on one page, and I‚Äôm on a completely different one. It can‚Äôt be helped most of the time. Society
                        itself puts us on different pages. They drive Range Rovers and have celebrity deejays at their
                        sweet sixteens. I had to scrape and scrounge and toast subs, and remake the subs that I toasted
                        badly, just to buy a car. A car that isn‚Äôt even 100 percent mine. My brother technically owns 40
                        percent of it and somehow manages to drive it 80 percent of the time.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre15">But I don‚Äôt say any of this to Amber for fear she might
                        fling a tray of cookies at me. Instead I watch as Madison pats Amber‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúYou need to
                        breathe, okay?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEat a macaron. They have lavender in them, right? That‚Äôs supposed to
                        be calming.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLavender just makes me think of Iris, which makes me enraged,‚Äù Amber says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We all look across the yard to where Iris is seated with Paige Breckner.
                        Together, she and Paige hold the titles of class president three years running (Iris), most
                        popular girl in our grade (Paige), and cutest couple in our school (collectively).</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Though ‚Äúcutest‚Äù isn‚Äôt quite right. I don‚Äôt think anyone who knows her would use
                        the word <i class="calibre13">cute</i> to describe anything relating to Iris Huang. Objectively,
                        she has a roundness-of-face and smallness-of-stature that could traditionally be deemed cute.
                        But she‚Äôs also ruthless and unforgiving and, some would say, ill-mannered and incredibly
                        unpleasant. Somehow, this doesn‚Äôt seem to affect her political standing, but then again, that
                        often seems to be the case in the real world as well.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But Paige and Iris have been the longest-enduring couple on record during our
                        time at the Prospect-Landower School for Girls, and so they are automatically termed ‚Äúcutest,‚Äù
                        because that‚Äôs shorter than ‚Äúlongest-enduring couple on record during our time at the
                        Prospect-Landower School for Girls.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I saw them once&mdash;I mean I‚Äôve seen them lots of times&mdash;but once, after
                        school, I saw them sitting on the low wall outside the lit building, sharing a pair of earbuds
                        and listening to something on one of their phones. Their heads were bent together, and then all
                        of a sudden Paige started dancing in her spot, mouthing along the words to whatever song it was.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris looked up at her, smiled, and then looked back at the phone. Paige started
                        bopping harder, lip-synching more emphatically, pointing at Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris ducked her head, blushed, focused on the screen until Paige got to her
                        feet, took Iris‚Äôs hands, and pulled her up, trying to get her to jump around. Iris looked
                        flustered but ‚Ä¶ endeared, I guess. Fond in a way I had never seen her look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Iris finally relented and joined in dancing, the earbud jerked right out
                        of her ear. She scrambled for it, accidentally yanking the other out of Paige‚Äôs ear. They both
                        ended up bent over laughing, leaning on each other for support.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It was sweet&mdash;that‚Äôs why it stuck with me. A rare moment where Iris didn‚Äôt
                        seem completely steely but instead kind of awkward and fumbly and smitten.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-71" class="calibre15">So maybe ‚Äúcutest‚Äù still means cutest, even where she‚Äôs
                        involved.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Right now, Paige is chatting with Sudha Prabhu, laughing behind one hand as
                        Sudha gestures animatedly, while Iris looks for all the world like she‚Äôs waiting in an airport
                        terminal and her flight has just been canceled. In a sea of pink, she is unrelentingly purple.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">At my table, Madison grins at Amber. ‚ÄúDeep breaths.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just want everything to be perfect,‚Äù Amber says, eyes wide and strangely
                        earnest as she looks around the table at each of us. ‚ÄúIs it? Do you like the food? Are you
                        having fun?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We all affirm the quality of the food and the fun we‚Äôre having. I nod
                        emphatically as I hork down a petit four.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs silly,‚Äù Amber says, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs just, you know. Senior year and all.
                        Everything we do is sort of the last time we get to do it. So it should be perfect, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We double down on the reassurances, and finally Amber seems satisfied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay. Okay, good.‚Äù She stands promptly, smooths down the front of her dress,
                        takes a deep breath, and then heads off to the next table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I adjust my own dress as the other girls start talking about school. I borrowed
                        it from Zoe, so although it fits the color scheme, it‚Äôs also a little too short and a little too
                        tight. When I came downstairs in it, my mom said ‚ÄúWowza,‚Äù and my dad, brow wrinkled, asked,
                        ‚ÄúWhat kind of party is this again?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Truth be told, I‚Äôd risk Amber‚Äôs wrath and wear the wrong color if it meant Zoe
                        could be here with me, wearing this dress instead. She is my best friend, and there‚Äôs only so
                        much a text can convey. Some of this stuff you just have to witness to fully appreciate. And
                        most of it, I‚Äôd probably have a lot more fun witnessing with her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But Zoe goes to Springdale High School, and I go to PLSG, and this isn‚Äôt really
                        the kind of thing where you can bring a plus one. So I send her a quick text update and then
                        listen in on Madison and Ainsley Stewart discussing some band they both watched on TV last
                        night.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The rest of the luncheon goes well, much to Amber‚Äôs relief. We eat fancy finger
                        foods. We toast each other with fizzy pink punch. There are speeches filled with assurances that
                        this is going to be the ‚Äúbest year ever‚Äù and a shit ton of light applause.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige stands at one point and thanks Amber for hosting.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">If you‚Äôre giving a presentation in class, Paige is the person who smiles at you
                        when you catch her eye and nods encouragingly, like she‚Äôs actually listening. We had gym
                        together freshman year, and whenever she was captain, she insisted on everyone counting off
                        instead of picking teams.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre15">When she finishes her toast, she turns to Iris with a
                        smile. ‚ÄúDo you want to add something, babe?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They share a look&mdash;in the silence, Paige‚Äôs expression shifts from hopeful
                        to imploring&mdash;until finally Iris pushes her chair back and stands, holding up her glass of
                        punch. She clears her throat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCareless tourism and destructive fishing practices are destroying our world‚Äôs
                        coral reefs,‚Äù she says, and then takes a drink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a joke. Like, admittedly you probably shouldn‚Äôt joke about
                        the destruction of our world‚Äôs coral reefs. A few people chuckle uncomfortably anyway.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris sits abruptly. Paige is still standing, her glass raised.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The look on her face is stricken, but somehow she manages to recover a smile.
                        ‚ÄúThank you again, Amber,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThis is ‚Ä¶ a great way to end the summer.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And that‚Äôs the last of the speeches. Conversation resumes around our little
                        tables, and I excuse myself after a bit. Amber‚Äôs mom points me in the direction of the bathroom,
                        but once I get inside the house, I realize that her directions of ‚Äúto the left and across from
                        the music room‚Äù kind of hinge on knowing which room is the music room. Which I don‚Äôt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So I head to the left and open the first door I come upon, and to my
                        disappointment, it isn‚Äôt a bathroom but a bedroom.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm in luck though&mdash;there‚Äôs a bathroom en suite. I dash in and take care
                        of business, and then I spend way too long sampling the products in pretty bottles on the
                        bathroom counter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm admiring the scents that I‚Äôve so expertly layered together (by squirting
                        three random lotions on at the same time) when I hear sounds from the outer room: voices
                        approaching and then the closing of the bedroom door. Sealing the voices inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú&mdash;believe you would act like that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to make a speech. I thought that was obvious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú<i class="calibre13">Coral reefs?</i> Seriously?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTell me we shouldn‚Äôt be more concerned about the state of the coral reefs.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige and Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôd always thought they were a good pair. People don‚Äôt like Iris, generally,
                        but they respect that she gets shit done. Conversely, everyone loves Paige. She‚Äôs friendly and
                        kind, neutral good through and through. She softens Iris. And I guess Iris gives her an edge.
                        What‚Äôs that saying&mdash;iron fist in a velvet glove? Iris is the former, and Paige is the
                        latter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not true, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not <i
                            class="calibre13">relevant to the situation</i>. This isn‚Äôt a freaking Envirothon meeting!‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre15">‚ÄúPlease. You know I don‚Äôt like how those Envirothon kids
                        conduct themselves.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt think of one nice thing. About Amber, or the summer, or school,
                        or anything. One nice thing. You could‚Äôve said the punch is good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe punch tastes like Windex.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúIris.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAt the very least, would it have been so hard to put on a pink dress?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna do something just because someone tells me to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou do tons of things because someone tells you to! You wear shoes in
                        restaurants! You obey seat belt laws!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big difference between doing something to prevent myself from flying
                        through a car windshield and doing something to satisfy a meaningless color scheme at a
                        meaningless party that neither of us actually care about.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú<i class="calibre13">I</i> care about it,‚Äù Paige says, and something in her
                        voice sounds frayed. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt matter to you. What I want. You never even ask me. You
                        just assume. You always&mdash;<i class="calibre13">always</i>&mdash;just assume.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silence follows. And in this silence, I realize several things&mdash;first,
                        that this is not just a little spat about a speech or a dress code. And second, that my temporal
                        window for stepping out of the bathroom and announcing my presence has entirely closed. I‚Äôm in
                        it for the long haul. I have to wait them out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do this,‚Äù Iris says finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A pause. ‚ÄúDo you understand though? About the dress? And the party? Do you get
                        that it‚Äôs important to me? And, like, how something that matters to me should be important to
                        you, too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stupid though,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúThis whole thing is stupid. If it was
                        something that actually <i class="calibre13">mattered</i>, I would&mdash;‚Äù She cuts off, starts
                        again. ‚ÄúYou know I would‚Ä¶‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt finish.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou would what?‚Äù A beat. ‚ÄúWhat would you do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Iris sounds sullen. ‚ÄúI would act like I cared more.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet. Behind me, a bead of water drips from the faucet into the sink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then there are footsteps in the outer room. I can‚Äôt tell which of them has
                        moved toward the other. Or if they‚Äôve moved away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Paige speaks again, her voice is thick. ‚ÄúI love you, Iris,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut
                        you‚Äôre the most selfish person I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I press my ear to the door. I‚Äôm only human, after all, and this is possibly the
                        best bit of drama I‚Äôve unwittingly stumbled onto in the whole of my high school career.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-74" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she says again, and I‚Äôm fairly certain she‚Äôs crying now. ‚ÄúBut I
                        want you to be different. I want, I wa&mdash;‚Äù Her voice hitches, like a sob. ‚ÄúI want you to be
                        better than you are.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I dated a boy named Will Sorenson for almost a whole semester in tenth grade.
                        January to April. We were going to go to his junior prom together that year, but he broke up
                        with me just two weeks shy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We were in his basement, and he was playing an online role-playing game called
                        Battle Quest. His character&mdash;a humanoid dragon named Alphoneus Centurion&mdash;was
                        approaching a snow-covered vista with a monster in his sights when Will glanced over at me and
                        said, ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt know, I just think maybe we should break up, you know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Like we had been having a conversation this whole time that I had somehow
                        missed. I pressed him to explain as Alphoneus Centurion launched a series of attacks against the
                        monster.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just think that when you‚Äôre with someone, you should ‚Ä¶ <i
                            class="calibre13">feel</i> something. Right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt feel anything with me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI feel regular with you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt feel ‚Ä¶ you know. Well, I mean,
                        if you knew, then you‚Äôd understand, and you‚Äôd want me to feel that with someone else. And if you
                        don‚Äôt know, then that means you don‚Äôt feel it either, and so we probably shouldn‚Äôt be together
                        anyway.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alphoneus raised his ax. The monster was a goner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Up until this moment, I thought that was the most crushing thing you could say
                        to someone you‚Äôre dumping. That you feel <i class="calibre13">regular</i> with them. It sort of
                        managed to negate every sweet thing that we ever had together. Like it was all fake. One-sided,
                        on my part. I was elated the first time he held my hand. I thought I might float off the
                        sidewalk. And now looking back, I see that everything that was massive to me, everything that
                        was meaningful&mdash;to him it was just <i class="calibre13">regular</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But Paige Breckner just took the cake in the breakup department. <i
                            class="calibre13">I want you to be better than you are.</i> If I were Iris, I would‚Äôve
                        disintegrated on the spot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris does no such thing. She just speaks, after a long pause, her voice in
                        stark contrast to Paige‚Äôs. It‚Äôs calm. Crisp. No hint of tears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you breaking up with me?‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige doesn‚Äôt reply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you. Breaking up with me?‚Äù Iris repeats, razor sharp.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Paige says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I realize I‚Äôm holding my breath. Waiting for&mdash;something. A reaction. A
                        movement. A sound. Anything.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-75" class="calibre15">And then a sound comes. A loud one in fact&mdash;the very
                        clear and deliberate peal of a bell.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a split second, it doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Paige breaks up with Iris and
                        Iris responds by whipping out a handbell?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I realize. My phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I fumble with my bag. Purses are interdimensional sometimes, I swear&mdash;
                        particularly when you‚Äôre trying to get something out of one. I finally extricate the phone, but
                        three more texts follow in the intervening time&mdash;three more pealing bells&mdash;that only
                        serve to further sink me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The silence that follows is deafening.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look into my palm. I might as well see the texts that are my undoing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">I need an update</i>, Zoe‚Äôs first message reads.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Are you eating cahhhhviahhhr with Ahhhmber</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">And Mahhhhdison and Aaaaaainsley and Desk Lahhhmp</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">And all of your other fahhhhhbulous clahhhhssmates?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I almost laugh&mdash;it would be funny, normally, but now it‚Äôs so terrible it
                        goes from terrible back into funny.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Until there‚Äôs the sound of footsteps that are most definitely approaching and a
                        firm knock on the door directly in front of my face. Then it goes right back into terrible.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHello?‚Äù It‚Äôs Paige.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hold my breath. Maybe if I‚Äôm perfectly still, perfectly silent, they‚Äôll think
                        that they‚Äôd heard wrong.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe heard your phone,‚Äù Paige says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow do you know it wasn‚Äôt your phone?‚Äù I reply. Because. I am. A moron.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I squeeze my eyes shut. Take a deep breath. And then I open the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs a Moment, between the three of us. There are just two hundred students at
                        PLSG. Fifty girls a grade. And although I know Amber and Madison and Ainsley and Desk Lamp
                        (there isn‚Äôt really a Desk Lamp, but Zoe likes to make fun of the names, how ‚Äúeveryone sounds
                        like an item from a furniture catalog, seriously‚Äù) and all the others in a cursory manner, there
                        aren‚Äôt many of them that I have had genuine Moments with.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The thing about Moments is that just because a moment is one, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs
                        a good one. They are not all Special, or Cherished, as picture frames and embellished scrapbook
                        inserts would have you believe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This is more of the Painfully Awkward variety. Me, clutching my phone in the
                        bathroom doorway, looking quite like my ear had just been pressed against the door&mdash;because
                        my ear <i class="calibre13">had</i> just been pressed against the door. Paige, her face red,
                        cheeks wet, eyes puffy. And Iris Huang, resplendent and terrifying in lavender YSL, looking at
                        me with a quiet, smoldering, single-minded rage.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-76" class="calibre15">Paige speaks first. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know anyone was in here,‚Äù
                        she says, and she‚Äôs clearly putting effort into sounding something close to normal, though she
                        doesn‚Äôt bother to wipe the tears tracking down her cheeks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anyone was out here. I didn‚Äôt hear anything,‚Äù I say, even though
                        it‚Äôs a lie compounded by another lie.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The silence is unbearable.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So I do what I do best, or what I do worst, I suppose&mdash;my greatest
                        strength is also my greatest weakness. I break it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI had the faucet on,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúReally loud. And I pee pretty loud. I‚Äôm
                        surprised you guys didn‚Äôt hear me, it was like Niagara Falls in here. Just really ‚Ä¶ very loud in
                        volume. A lot of ‚Ä¶ liquids ‚Ä¶ flowing in a ‚Ä¶ noisy fashion.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige blinks at me, clearly caught off guard, but Iris‚Äôs eyes only narrow, the
                        rage intensifying.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I have to get out of here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll just ‚Ä¶ leave you guys to it.‚Ä¶ Not that I know what <i
                            class="calibre13">it</i> is, not that I heard anything,‚Äù I say, and make to leave, but Paige
                        moves to the door first.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm going,‚Äù she says, and then quickly walks out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Leaving me. And Iris. Alone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris crosses immediately to me and holds a finger up to my face. She forces me
                        backward, back into the bathroom, where I stumble over the rug and catch myself on the fancy
                        towel rack.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat did you hear?‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing. I heard nothing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou are, you‚Äôre terrible at it. If you go back out there and tell
                        everyone&mdash; if you tell them&mdash;‚Äù She falters. And I would hardly believe it unless I saw
                        it myself, but Iris‚Äôs eyes swiftly fill with tears. Her lower lip quivers. It legitimately
                        quivers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her voice is thick when she speaks: ‚ÄúI will <i class="calibre13">ruin</i> you.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then she turns and leaves.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>two</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">I go to work at Pinky‚Äôs on Sunday. The day after Iris declared that she would
                        ruin me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I rejoined the party yesterday, she was nowhere in sight. Paige had
                        resumed her seat, but she was looking decidedly worse for wear and the rest of her table had
                        clearly noticed. Sudha had one arm around her, their heads bent together in conversation, and
                        Alicia Smith was kneeling at her side, holding up a pink patterned napkin so Paige could wipe
                        her eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Word would travel fast. I didn‚Äôt need to tell anyone what I had heard.
                        Furthermore, I didn‚Äôt <i class="calibre13">want</i> to tell anyone. First, because it was no
                        one‚Äôs business, and second, because I didn‚Äôt want the wrath of Iris Huang to befall me and my
                        family.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I replay it in my mind as I pull a sub out of the toaster and deposit it on the
                        counter in front of me (a little charred around the edges, but hopefully that would escape
                        notice). No one had ever sworn my ruin before.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I would just steer clear of them both at school. I‚Äôve managed to fly under the
                        radar pretty effectively these last three years. It won‚Äôt be hard to pull off a fourth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Stealth mode,</i> I think as I cut and wrap up the
                        sandwich in patterned Pinky‚Äôs paper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Pinky‚Äôs is ‚Äúhome of the nine-inch sub.‚Äù <i class="calibre13">Fifty percent more
                            than a Subway sub!</i> the sign declares.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right,‚Äù I said to my manager Aaron on my first day.
                        ‚ÄúBecause Subway subs are twelve inches? So really it‚Äôs only seventy-five percent of a Subway
                        sub?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey mean the six-inch,‚Äù he replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo maybe they should say that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHome of the nine-inch sub<i class="calibre13">, fifty percent more than a
                            six-inch Subway sub</i>,‚Äù Aaron contemplated, and then shook his head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too much
                        numerical information. It‚Äôs too cerebral.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-77" class="calibre15">This was possibly the first time anyone had used the
                        phrase ‚Äútoo cerebral‚Äù when describing Pinky‚Äôs advertising. Because someone somewhere in the
                        Pinky‚Äôs marketing scheme had made the brilliant connection that sub sandwiches are vaguely
                        phallic. And from that, all the penis-related Pinky sub campaigns were born.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Like the commercial where you see the guy standing from the back, and then a
                        woman in front of him, and she says, ‚ÄúNine inches????‚Äù in this insane lusty voice, and then they
                        pan to the side and show that he‚Äôs holding a Pinky sub right at groin height? It‚Äôs the worst. It
                        is literally the worst. I‚Äôm a cog in the world‚Äôs dumbest corporate sandwich machine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But I needed a job. And Pinky‚Äôs was hiring. So here I am.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe comes over that evening when I get off work, and we ride our bikes to the
                        Tropical Moose to get snow cones. The car is free&mdash;Alex is actually home for once&mdash;but
                        I‚Äôm stiff from standing all day and I smell like Pinky‚Äôs. I want to ride, to feel the late
                        summer air rushing through my hair, to pedal fast and feel the burn of it in my legs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I get a pi√±a colada&ndash;flavored snow cone, Zoe gets a bubble gum one, and we
                        manage to secure a table out front, the kind with the chairs that leave waffle patterns on the
                        backs of your thighs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre settled in when two little kids pass by clutching blue cones. A woman
                        follows close behind but veers toward our table as they pass.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou have beautiful hair,‚Äù she says to Zoe, who smiles and nods in reply, her
                        mouth full of slush. She pulls a face at me when the woman has passed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe does have beautiful hair. The rest of her is pretty magnificent as well
                        &mdash;dark eyes with the longest lashes, flawless brown skin. One time a barista at Starbucks
                        wrote <i class="calibre13">your smile is gorgeous</i> on Zoe‚Äôs coffee cup. I took a picture of
                        her holding the cup, smiling wide, and we put it on Tumblr, and to date it has over fifty
                        thousand notes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It makes sense to me, knowing Zoe as I do. Her outside matches her insides. I
                        know goodness doesn‚Äôt manifest itself as beauty&mdash;she‚Äôs not pretty because she‚Äôs smart, or
                        funny, or kind&mdash;but it‚Äôs fitting. She‚Äôs my favorite person, and if one of us had to grow up
                        ridiculously beautiful, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs her. It just makes sense.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI have calc and lit with Kris,‚Äù Zoe says, continuing our previous
                        conversation. ‚ÄúAnd AP Bio with Gabby, so that‚Äôs something. What‚Äôs your schedule like?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shrug. ‚ÄúWhat it‚Äôs always like.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, how was the party? You never texted back.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Now there is no way Iris Huang could be privy to this conversation. Zoe doesn‚Äôt
                        even go to our school&mdash;she‚Äôs at Springdale, the public school in our generic Chicago
                        suburb. We live in one of the neighborhoods that‚Äôs fare-and-a-half to get to if you take a cab
                        from the city. PLSG is twenty minutes from Springdale, and most of the richest girls live even
                        farther out. So the likelihood of Iris popping up and hearing me tell Zoe that I witnessed the
                        Breakup of the Century (or at least of the Year to Come) is pretty slim. And usually I tell Zoe
                        everything. But. Something in me just ‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt want to risk it.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-78" class="calibre15">So I just shrug again and say, ‚ÄúThe food was good. There
                        was a lot of talk of this year being <i class="calibre13">our year</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWho did all the other years belong to?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúRight? I asked Madison that. She looked at me like I was crazy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúToo bad she can‚Äôt buy a sense of humor.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôd sell her mine.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou could buy another car with the money.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm funny enough for car money?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFor sure. You‚Äôre minimum pre-owned Toyota Corolla funny.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet as we finish our snow cones, but not a bad kind of quiet. With some
                        people I feel the need to fill the space, but with Zoe, it‚Äôs okay. It doesn‚Äôt have to be
                        constant. We can listen to the hum of crickets, the buzz of the tree frogs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We ride back to my place when we‚Äôre finished. I ask Zoe if she wants to come
                        in, but she shakes her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI should get back. It‚Äôs officially a school night.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt was good while it lasted.‚Äù Zoe smiles&mdash;her radiant Starbucks cup smile
                        &mdash;and all at once I‚Äôm struck with something Amber said at the party&mdash;<i
                            class="calibre13">senior year and all.</i> How everything we do is sort of the last time we
                        get to do it. Tomorrow is the very last Back to School for us. Back to high school, anyway.
                        Meaning that today&mdash;tonight, right now&mdash;is the end of the very last summer of the way
                        things are. Next summer we might go off to college at different times. To different cities.
                        Different time zones. I can‚Äôt imagine it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Or rather, I can. I just don‚Äôt want to.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt say any of that. ‚ÄúText me tomorrow,‚Äù I say instead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWill do.‚Äù Zoe gets back on her bike. ‚ÄúNight, Claude.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNight.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watch her pedal away.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>three</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">My mom makes me stand on the front steps before I leave for school the next
                        morning so she can take a picture. The annual first day of school stoop photo. Frames hang in
                        the kitchen for each of us&mdash;a big print scroll across the top declaring <i
                            class="calibre13">My School Days</i> with twelve little spaces underneath for pictures.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">All of Alex‚Äôs spaces were filled as of last year, and Julia‚Äôs were finished
                        long ago. Her frame doesn‚Äôt even match ours.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Today is my last School Days picture. There is a 45 percent chance my mom will
                        burst into tears before I leave the house. So I try to move the process along, shouldering my
                        backpack, holding my lunch bag to my side, and raising one hand in a big thumbs-up. The
                        traditional pose. The very last box to be filled.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù Mom says, tapping her phone screen half a dozen
                        times, and the odds raise: 56 percent chance of tears now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe should get going,‚Äù I say, moving to step off the porch. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Dad?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWait wait wait, let‚Äôs get one of you and your brother.‚Äù She turns. ‚ÄúAlex, get
                        over here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He‚Äôs in the driveway, leaning against the car.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm good actually,‚Äù he says, not looking up from his phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOne picture.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He sighs, types one more thing, and then shoves his phone in his pocket and
                        joins me on the porch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCloser together,‚Äù Mom instructs. ‚ÄúAlex, put your arm around your sister
                        &mdash;it‚Äôs her last first day of school.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome on, Alex,‚Äù I say, picking up his arm and slinging it around my shoulders.
                        I poke his side, and he smiles for a second before twisting away. I hope my mom got the shot,
                        because that‚Äôs the only opportunity she‚Äôs going to get this morning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, one more with Daddy!‚Äù she says as my dad emerges from the front door,
                        balancing a doughnut on top of a travel mug, but Alex is already heading back to the car.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWho called the paparazzi?‚Äù Dad says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúExcuse me, I am one photographer.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWho called the paparazzo?‚Äù he amends, and then strikes a pose next to me.
                        ‚ÄúMake sure to get my good side.‚Äù And then, ‚ÄúWe should take a selfie,‚Äù he says when my mom lowers
                        her phone again. ‚ÄúAnd send it to your sister!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Sending selfies to Julia is something we do at least once a week, if not more.
                        Since moving to Indianapolis with her husband, Julia has gotten a surplus of Wallace family
                        selfies. I‚Äôve always wondered how she feels about them. If it comes off as ‚ÄúWe wish you were
                        here!‚Äù like my parents intended, or if it‚Äôs more like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all here and you‚Äôre not!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We take one regardless. I think Alex will just sulk in the background, but he
                        tosses up a peace sign at the last moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis has been great,‚Äù Alex says, ‚Äúbut some of us have jobs.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd some of us have school,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd some of us have jobs at school!‚Äù Dad declares.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watch Alex drive away in my car. The main reason I wanted that car so badly
                        was so that I could drive myself to school. But going in on it with Alex was the only way I
                        could afford it. And Alex apparently needs the car more because his schedule is ‚Äúflexible‚Äù and
                        there‚Äôs no point in it ‚Äúsitting around all day‚Äù in my school‚Äôs parking lot when he could be
                        doing ‚Äúlike, stuff, I don‚Äôt know, just stuff.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So Alex gets the car during the day, and I drive in with my dad. It is not
                        remotely fair. But Alex maintains that he‚Äôs way more experienced in the art of ‚Äúnot remotely
                        fair,‚Äù so this is, in some ways, retribution.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It isn‚Äôt my fault that Prospect-Landower is a girls‚Äô school. It isn‚Äôt my fault
                        that our dad works there. And it wasn‚Äôt my idea to go there in the first place. I wanted to go
                        to Springdale with Zoe and all our friends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis is an incredible opportunity,‚Äù my mom had said way back when, smoothing
                        the hair off my face. ‚ÄúSo many girls would be so happy for a chance to go to Prospect.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThen one of them should go for me,‚Äù I had mumbled, pressing a tearstained
                        cheek into Mom‚Äôs shoulder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs a privilege. I get that now. But it didn‚Äôt seem like one back then.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My dad parks in the faculty lot, and we part ways at the lit building. PLSG
                        isn‚Äôt one big building but multiple small ones, like a tiny college. Brick buildings with black
                        shutters and white trim. It‚Äôs very picturesque. I guess playing up curb appeal is part of
                        justifying the price tag.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I haven‚Äôt checked like Zoe, messaging back and forth with friends to confirm
                        who I have what class with. It doesn‚Äôt really matter much to me either way.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre15">But I wish I had planned ahead&mdash;consulted some of the
                        girls beforehand. Because then I would‚Äôve been prepared to walk into British lit and see Paige
                        Breckner and Iris Huang, seated at opposite ends of the room. Paige is in the back, buffered by
                        Sudha and Alicia, and Iris is at the front, alone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">This might not be good,</i> I think to myself, but there‚Äôs
                        nothing to be done about it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúJust please come with me, I don‚Äôt want to go by myself.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Caris Pearlman corners me after lit. A surprisingly uneventful class, actually.
                        We went over the syllabus. We got a Chaucer excerpt to read for Wednesday. All in all, pretty
                        anticlimactic compared to the scenarios I had imagined in my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The halls are clearing out now, a steady stream of girls heading toward the
                        dining hall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just need to give him something,‚Äù Caris says, looking at me earnestly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut then maybe ‚Ä¶ I shouldn‚Äôt, you know, be there. In that case.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her cheeks flush. ‚ÄúNot like&mdash;that‚Äôs why I want you to go with me. It seems
                        so <i class="calibre13">illicit</i> otherwise.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could see Caris Pearlman in Regency times, wearing an empire-waist gown, a
                        long string of pearls around her neck, smiling behind a fan in some crowded London ballroom. She
                        certainly fit the Regency romance sensibility. And I would know. My mom is an avid romance
                        reader, and I snuck all kinds of books when I was younger&mdash;novels with women in satin
                        dresses reclining on divans, or masked men in greatcoats on the cover, white shirts splayed open
                        revealing bare chests. Always with titles like <i class="calibre13">The Duke and the Devil</i>
                        or <i class="calibre13">Passion Is a British Rogue</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Though I suppose Caris is the Before in the Regency romance scenario. Before
                        the encounters with the British rogue and all that, driving the heroine <i class="calibre13">mad
                            with lust</i> and whatnot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Caris does not appear to be mad with lust in this moment. Instead, she is
                        standing before me, clutching a cellophane-wrapped loaf of what she later informs me is zucchini
                        bread, after I agree to accompany her, and we make our way to the Grove.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The Grove is a small stretch of woods that separates PLSG and the neighboring
                        boys‚Äô school, Danforth Prep. It‚Äôs back behind PLSG‚Äôs library, and Danforth‚Äôs athletic fields
                        abut it. There was talk a few years ago about bulldozing the Grove and merging the two campuses,
                        but there was enough outcry to stop that from happening. A lot of stuff about ‚Äúmaintaining the
                        storied traditions of two treasured institutions.‚Äù Thus these treasured institutions remain
                        separate.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre15">Though not so separate that any PLSG student or any
                        Danforth Prep student couldn‚Äôt just waltz through the woods to the opposite school. Or, as is
                        the fashion sometimes, meet in the Grove itself and ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know. Make out up against a
                        tree. Smoke drugs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">(‚ÄúSmoke drugs?‚Äù Zoe said when I hypothesized this to her once. ‚ÄúSmoke. Drugs.
                        Yeah, I bet that‚Äôs it. I bet they get high on that reefer. They smoke that Mary Jane. Maybe they
                        even <i class="calibre13">consume alcohol</i>. Can you imagine?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay, I get it. That was stupid.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying we need to corral your ass into this century, but we probably
                        need to corral your ass into this century.‚Äù)</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Apparently, the Grove is also a spot where students occasionally meet to
                        exchange first-day-of-school baked goods, as is the tradition between Caris and her boyfriend,
                        Robbie.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Technically, we‚Äôre not supposed to be back here at lunch. But of course that‚Äôs
                        never really stopped anyone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stand off to the side&mdash;glaringly superfluous now&mdash;as Caris and
                        Robbie kiss and exchange snacks. If Iris and Paige are&mdash;were&mdash;the cutest couple at
                        PLSG, Caris and Robbie are probably now the pair to beat for cutest in the PLSG&ndash;Danforth
                        collective.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Caris and Robbie start doing more kissing than talking (maybe she‚Äôs more
                        <i class="calibre13">mad with lust</i> than I thought), I wander off. There‚Äôs no official path
                        through the Grove, but one has been worn down over the years. A track cleared via repeated use.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pull a sandwich out of my bag&mdash;it is lunchtime, after all&mdash;and
                        start in on it as I meander through the trees. I hear voices up ahead, and I spot people as I
                        round the bend leading down to Danforth‚Äôs fields.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A group has gathered at the base of one of the tallest trees, just at the edge
                        of the woods. A few girls from my class&mdash;Lena Ideker, Sudha, and Alicia, as well as a
                        couple of juniors&mdash;are joined by several Danforth guys.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I recognize one of them in particular. I don‚Äôt know Gideon Prewitt personally,
                        but I know a good deal <i class="calibre13">of</i> him, because everyone knows of him. He‚Äôs an
                        undeniable presence in the social media scene of PLSG. Constantly referenced, constantly tagged,
                        constantly popping up in pictures to press kisses against the cheeks of girls who are usually
                        smiling so wide their eyes crinkle with it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Right now Gideon is leaning into Lena Ideker‚Äôs space. She‚Äôs smiling coyly up at
                        him, her back resting against the tree trunk behind them.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-82" class="calibre15">I could never look so cool. So unaffected.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watch as he says something to her. She responds with a nod, says something in
                        reply, and he throws his head back in a laugh. It rings out&mdash;a bright, loud burst of
                        laughter&mdash;reaching even me where I stand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere you are!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I turn as Caris and Robbie approach, holding their baked goods and each other‚Äôs
                        hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry. You seemed ‚Ä¶ involved,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Caris‚Äôs cheeks are flushed. Robbie‚Äôs hair is much more mussed than it was when
                        he first greeted us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Caris ducks her head, but before she can speak, a call bursts out from the
                        group nearby:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúROBERT A. FISCHMAN,‚Äù a deep voice bellows. We all turn. Gideon Prewitt is
                        still standing with Lena under the tree, but he‚Äôs looking our way, both of his arms raised in
                        the air like a referee declaring <i class="calibre13">Goal!</i> ‚ÄúBIG FISH ROB. GET OVER HERE.
                        BRING YOUR LOVELY GIRLFRIEND. BRING HER LOVELY FRIEND.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Robbie raises his eyebrows at us. Caris looks to me, smiles prettily, and I
                        shrug.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So we go over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon Prewitt moves toward us when we reach the group. He shakes Robbie‚Äôs hand
                        enthusiastically.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got some lip gloss on your cheek, pal,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd on your neck.
                        And&mdash;‚Äù He drops Robbie‚Äôs hand and pulls the collar of Robbie‚Äôs shirt aside, then wiggles
                        his eyebrows at Caris. ‚ÄúGet it, girl.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Caris turns redder, her cuteness intensifying.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow was your summer, Caris?‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúWas it great?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nods rigorously. ‚ÄúYeah, it was awesome.‚Äù She grips Robbie‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI mean,
                        we mostly just hung out. But it was really fun.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, then I don‚Äôt need to ask Big Fish Rob how his summer was. Must‚Äôve been
                        the best if he was spending time with you.‚Äù Gideon turns his gaze to me. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your friend?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, this is Claudia,‚Äù Caris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThird wheel extraordinaire,‚Äù I murmur as I reach for the hand Gideon has
                        extended toward me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs heard me, but his grin widens as he clasps my hand. ‚ÄúNice to
                        meet you. How was your summer?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Are you personally responsible for the quality of
                            everyone‚Äôs summer?</i> I want to ask, but I don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúVery average,‚Äù I say instead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His eyes are bright. ‚ÄúGood. I guess? Is that good?‚Äù Before I can respond, he
                        introduces me to the other guys in the group and then encompasses the girls in one sweeping
                        gesture&mdash;‚ÄúYou must know these girls already, you must be blessed with their faces on a
                        daily basis‚Äù&mdash;and then we hang out with them for a little while, until it‚Äôs close enough to
                        next period that I want to get back.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre15">I nudge Caris, tapping at my wrist, and she nods.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon flashes me a dazzling smile as we prepare to leave, while Caris gives
                        Robbie a quick peck on the lips, and then another, and another.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt was great meeting you,‚Äù Gideon says to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù I say, and I don‚Äôt point out that today is not actually the first
                        time we‚Äôve met.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Caris and I get back to the dining hall, lunch is almost over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll share my cookies with you. Robbie‚Äôs mom made them.
                        They‚Äôre my favorite.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. I ate a sandwich in the woods.‚Äù As you do.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She ignores me, fumbling with the Ziploc bag and then thrusting a large,
                        lumpy-looking cookie at me. ‚ÄúJust take one. They‚Äôre so good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It appears I have no choice in the matter. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo problem. Thank you. And thanks from Robbie.‚Äù She gives me a winning smile
                        and then heads off.</p>

                    <h2>four</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Brit lit, on the whole, doesn‚Äôt turn out to be the powder keg I expected it to
                        be. That week, we read excerpts from <i class="calibre13">The Canterbury Tales</i>. We do some
                        critical discussion. Paige and Iris stay at their respective poles of the room, I stay in the
                        center, and neither of them acknowledge me. By the end of the first week, I think that maybe
                        this will be all right.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I am lulled into complacency. But then.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then, the following week, Mrs. Dennings claps her hands and says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna
                        partner up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Our first project of the year. A group project.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need groups of two and one group of three.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look immediately to Sam McKellar, sitting to my left, but she‚Äôs already
                        locked eyes with Polly Allman, sitting next to her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Okay, fine. Me, Sam, and Polly then. Group of three, locked down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But before I can catch Sam‚Äôs eye, Polly has gestured to Kaitlyn, and they‚Äôre
                        all nodding to one another in silent agreement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the group of three!‚Äù Polly declares loudly, before I can beg them to
                        reconsider.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So I‚Äôm the odd one out. I scan the room, trying not to look too frantic, but
                        panic begins to well up as everyone else pairs off around me. That ‚ÄúI cannot be entirely left
                        out‚Äù desperation, that ‚ÄúI cannot be the only loser without a partner‚Äù dread.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. Dennings must notice. ‚ÄúWho still needs a partner?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Time to accept my fate. I raise my hand. And across the room, front row,
                        opposite corner, Iris Huang raises hers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris glances around and we lock eyes. Something flashes across her face,
                        something akin to horror, but it quickly disappears, replaced with cool indifference.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to work alone,‚Äù she says to Mrs. Dennings.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want anyone alone on this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôd really prefer to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. Dennings‚Äôs lips twitch at the pushback, but she doesn‚Äôt reprimand Iris.
                        She just casts her eyes over the group as a whole. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôd like, I can always <i
                            class="calibre13">assign</i> partners&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The class lets out a collective groan of protest that not even Iris can
                        withstand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúWhatever. It‚Äôs fine.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Brilliant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I basically have to chase Iris down after class. I catch up with her at her
                        locker, where she‚Äôs furiously spinning the combination lock.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, we should probably exchange numbers or whatever, to plan for the paper.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris pulls down on the lock a little harder than strictly necessary.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI will write the body of the paper,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou will write the
                        introduction and the conclusion.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not ‚Ä¶ equal at all.‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm offering to do the majority of the work here and you‚Äôre
                        offended by that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIntro. Conclusion.‚Äù She picks a book out of the bottom of her locker and slams
                        the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat about the thesis statement? Like, we should decide that together, don‚Äôt
                        you think? You know, do some planning‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf it really matters that much to you, I‚Äôll write the first half, and you can
                        write the second half. Sound good?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut I&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Iris says, and walks away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a monster,‚Äù I say that night.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all monsters,‚Äù Zoe replies, and on-screen, Zoe‚Äôs avatar, Korbinian
                        Brodmann, raises his bow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, not&mdash;‚Äù I jump aside as Korbinian spins around me, shooting half a
                        dozen arrows in quick succession and felling the first group of beasts surrounding us. ‚ÄúNot
                        them,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúIris. From school.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I switch from my saber to my broadsword and hack at a couple more.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGeez, where‚Äôs Alex?‚Äù Zoe says as we continue to get swarmed.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-85" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWork. School. Who knows.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe said he‚Äôd play. This tank doesn‚Äôt know what the hell he‚Äôs doing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAlex wouldn‚Äôt tank anyway, he‚Äôs trying to level up his mage.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tanks play a critical role in online role-playing games like Battle Quest. They
                        essentially function to distract monsters and bosses and allow fighters to get hits in. Alex is
                        good at it&mdash;he‚Äôs the best tank of the three of us&mdash;and he would‚Äôve been better than
                        the random person we recruited online.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We finish the rest of the dungeon off pretty quickly and score our loot. Not
                        too bad for a routine sweep, though it would‚Äôve been faster with Alex.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTell me about this girl again?‚Äù Zoe says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris. She‚Äôs a nightmare. We‚Äôre writing a paper together and she won‚Äôt even
                        talk to me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause she‚Äôs&mdash;‚Äù I stop, shake my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, she just doesn‚Äôt
                        like me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI find that hard to believe. Everyone likes you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know we‚Äôve been friends too long for you to lie like that,‚Äù I say, setting
                        my controller aside. We‚Äôre in my room, Zoe on the bed with her MacBook and me at the desk on the
                        old laptop I got from Julia. Technically it was from Julia‚Äôs husband, Mark. It‚Äôs terribly old,
                        but it runs Battle Quest and it was free, and that‚Äôs what counts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôve been playing Battle Quest ever since Will Sorenson and I broke up. To say
                        he got me into it in the first place wouldn‚Äôt be quite right. I only ever really watched him
                        play. It was after we broke up that I truly dove into it, and it was Julia and Mark who walked
                        me through it. Showed me around the world of Aradana, leveled me up fast, ran me through my
                        first dungeons.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I got Zoe and Alex into it, too, and now we‚Äôre in a guild, single-minded in one
                        mission: battling the Lord of Wizard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The latest expansion is called Battle Quest: Lord of Wizard, but technically,
                        the Lord of Wizard himself is only a character nominally. The story line is about a
                        centuries-old pact between the Lord of Wizard and an ancient prince of Aradana who beseeched the
                        Lord of Wizard to stop an encroaching civil war among the Aradanian people. The Lord of Wizard
                        cast a powerful spell and brought the country peace on the condition that in a thousand years,
                        he would return and claim one thing from the kingdom as his own. The prince, a somewhat
                        short-term thinker, agreed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A thousand years went by, and it wasn‚Äôt until the expansion pack came out that
                        it became clear that what the Lord of Wizard wanted from the kingdom was the throne.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The current prince refused, things escalated, and now the Lord of Wizard has
                        sent troops to Aradana: an army of supernatural creatures&mdash;banshees, wendigos, the
                        undead&mdash;and the citizens of Aradana have to fight back, slay the troops, the troop leaders,
                        and finally the army‚Äôs top general, and win the war.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre15">That‚Äôs all fine and good (to be honest, it‚Äôs a lot like
                        the war that was prevented in the original Battle Quest), but the real buzz about the expansion
                        is that a series of side quests, performed in a precise order, accomplishing a very specific set
                        of tasks and acquiring a very specific set of items, will allow you to unlock a secret story
                        line that involves battling the Lord of Wizard personally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre determined to do it. People have been very tight-lipped about it
                        online&mdash;some say it‚Äôs because no one has ever reached that final battle, or because it‚Äôs
                        all just a rumor. But Julia and Mark are obsessed&mdash;they follow gamers, read message boards
                        religiously, and have online friends who are dead serious about it&mdash;and they swear it‚Äôs
                        real.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe and I play a little longer this evening, just doing random sweeps for
                        monsters. We‚Äôve been trying to unravel the rumored Lord of Wizard quests when the whole group is
                        assembled, and Julia and Mark are probably still at work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex shows up just as we‚Äôre winding down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He sticks his head in my door. ‚ÄúYou guys wanna do dungeons?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe could‚Äôve used you like an hour ago,‚Äù Zoe says, one eyebrow raised.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry. Work. I can play now though?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe makes a face. ‚ÄúI should probably get going. I have homework, and Claude has
                        to work on a paper with her new best friend, Iris.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI thought you hated Iris,‚Äù Alex says, looking at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate anyone.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot even Voldemort?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, yes, obviously. But I don‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hate the Joker?‚Äù Zoe says. ‚ÄúWhat about Darth Vader? Do you hate
                        Darth Vader, or is it mostly, you know, like cool indifference?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex leans against the doorframe. ‚ÄúOkay, Fuck Marry Kill: Voldemort, the Joker,
                        and Darth Vader.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGeez, you guys,‚Äù I say as I go to shut down Battle Quest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFuck the Joker,‚Äù Zoe says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Alex squawks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She shrugs. ‚ÄúLedger over Nicholson, though.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúEw,‚Äù I say, and Google pictures of the Joker, because I don‚Äôt know what a
                        Nicholson Joker looks like. Zoe knows more about movies than me. Movies, and art, and math, and
                        science, and pretty much everything. Zoe‚Äôs character isn‚Äôt named Korbinian Brodmann for
                        nothing&mdash;he‚Äôs a nineteenth century neuroscientist who categorized different regions of the
                        brain. My character, for contrast, is named Viola Constantinople, which was literally the first
                        name I thought of upon launching my character profile.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre15">‚ÄúKill Darth Vader, and marry Voldemort,‚Äù Zoe finishes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Alex says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the exact wrong answer.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt want to participate, but I can‚Äôt stop myself: ‚ÄúWhy would you marry
                        Voldemort? Why would you not kill Voldemort?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, literally, who chooses to not kill Voldemort?‚Äù Alex says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think I could change the course of his whole life,‚Äù Zoe says simply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think you could change Darth Vader?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNah, girl, Padm√© tried.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI feel like I would fuck Darth Vader, because he‚Äôs got like powers and stuff,
                        you know?‚Äù Alex says. ‚ÄúHow would the Force factor in? How would we negotiate the suit and stuff?
                        It‚Äôs a guaranteed wild ride from start to finish.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI hate everything about this conversation,‚Äù I say, shutting down my computer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou love it. You love us,‚Äù Zoe says, and she‚Äôs right. I do.</p>

                    <h2>five</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Iris sends me exactly one half of a paper the day before it‚Äôs due. I have to
                        stay up half the night trying to finish it, but I do, and we get it in on time. Hopefully, this
                        is the last joint effort she and I ever undertake.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs a futile hope, though. I know when Mrs. Dennings holds us back after
                        class, the week after the papers are due.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI wanted to speak with you both privately before I hand papers back,‚Äù she says
                        quietly, though we‚Äôre the only ones in the room and have taken seats in the desks closest to
                        hers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had you both before. I know you‚Äôre very bright students.‚Äù She picks up a paper off
                        the stack on her desk. ‚ÄúBut I was surprised by the quality of the work you handed in.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I see the grade printed at the top of the page, and it sets off a Klaxon in my
                        brain. I can‚Äôt afford to do badly in a class. Literally. I need a scholarship for college, so
                        every little bit counts. Any little screwup could put that in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat exactly are the issues?‚Äù Iris says curtly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think the main thing is a real lack of cohesion,‚Äù Mrs. Dennings says, not
                        unkindly, and then outlines a number of other problems that make me regret Iris asking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stare down at my desk. I can see Iris in my peripheral vision, sitting up
                        straight, her hands clasped in her lap.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Mrs. Dennings finishes, Iris speaks: ‚ÄúIs there anything we can do to make
                        it up? A revision? An extra credit assignment?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. Dennings purses her lips for a moment. And then: ‚ÄúYes, in fact. There is.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The halls are deserted when we get out of the lit room, lunch having started
                        already. Iris pushes past me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey&mdash;‚Äù I start, and I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm about to follow it up with, if
                        the words <i class="calibre13">watch where you‚Äôre going</i> or <i class="calibre13">don‚Äôt take
                            this out on me</i> or <i class="calibre13">this is your fault, too</i> will actually leave
                        my lips, or if they‚Äôll shrivel up and die upon one look from Iris.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt give me the chance to find out, whirling
                        around and beating me to it: ‚ÄúThis is all your fault, you know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Our next unit is Shakespeare. And conveniently, the drama department at
                        Danforth Prep is doing <i class="calibre13">A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream</i> as their fall
                        production. In conjunction with PLSG.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So in addition to rewriting our paper, Iris and I have been ‚Äústrongly urged‚Äù to
                        audition for extra credit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAt least we get a chance to make it up,‚Äù I say. Overwhelming relief is my main
                        feeling at the moment&mdash;maybe the semester‚Äôs gotten off to a rocky start, but this one
                        failure won‚Äôt haunt my transcript forever.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be in this position in the first place. We wouldn‚Äôt be here if
                        you hadn‚Äôt fucked up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what you were trying to say! Your thesis made no sense, and you
                        didn‚Äôt give me enough time to rework it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike I‚Äôd let you rewrite something I wrote. Like I‚Äôd trust you with that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It comes out before I can stop it: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get why you don‚Äôt like me. You
                        don‚Äôt even know me enough to not like me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to know you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJust because I&mdash;‚Äù <i class="calibre13">Overheard you getting brutally
                            dumped</i>. I stop short.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause you what?‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks away. ‚ÄúThis is your fault,‚Äù she says again. ‚ÄúIf you had finished
                        earlier, we could‚Äôve fixed it, <i class="calibre13">I</i> could‚Äôve fixed it. But now we‚Äôre being
                        <i class="calibre13">High School Musical</i>-ed, and it‚Äôs all your fault.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú<i class="calibre13">High School Musical</i>. In the third one, they get in
                        trouble, and the English teacher makes them work on the school play?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks so angry, for a moment it‚Äôs hard to comprehend that she‚Äôs describing
                        a Disney Channel franchise to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know the policy here, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf you audition, you have to
                        work on the play. So no matter if we get parts or not‚Äù&mdash;<i class="calibre13">or not</i>
                        will be the case for me&mdash;‚Äúwe have to work on the show. One bad paper and our semester is
                        fucked.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not ‚Ä¶ fucked.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, maybe if you don‚Äôt have anything else going on in your life, but in case
                        you haven‚Äôt noticed, I actually <i class="calibre13">do</i> stuff around here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI do stuff,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúI mean, besides take up
                        space. What do you actually do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I open my mouth to speak but then shut it again. I have never met anyone with
                        such a highly concentrated meanness in them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Iris spits. I‚Äôm not intimidated&mdash;well, maybe I am, a
                        little&mdash;but it‚Äôs more of a bone-deep desire to avoid confrontation. I have a general life
                        tenet that I feel can be applied to pretty much anything&mdash;<i class="calibre13">worth it</i>
                        or <i class="calibre13">not worth it</i>. And fighting back is not worth it in this moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So I just shake my head. Iris‚Äôs lip curls in disgust, and she turns and walks
                        away.</p>

                    <h2>six</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Auditions for <i class="calibre13">A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream</i> are held at
                        Danforth Prep. It‚Äôs a bigger school than PLSG, with a brand-new arts building, and I find myself
                        there after school on Tuesday.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre meant to assemble in the dining hall and sign in. I‚Äôm making my way
                        through the hallway of the main building when I see Iris up ahead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôs stopped outside the door to the cafeteria, staring at her phone. If she
                        turns her head, she‚Äôll see me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I duck behind a nearby statue that a plaque proclaims is Kenneth Danforth.
                        Kenneth Danforth has a wide stance, and there‚Äôs enough room behind him to nearly obscure me. I
                        crouch down a little anyway&mdash;we‚Äôre almost of a height, Kenneth and me&mdash;just for good
                        measure.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm only there a moment when&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are we doing?‚Äù someone says in my ear, and I almost jump a foot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I turn, and Gideon Prewitt is looking at me, eyes alight. ‚ÄúAre you hiding from
                        somebody?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It takes me a moment to recover, not just from the scare but from the full
                        force of Gideon Prewitt‚Äôs Gideon Prewitt-ness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Madison Lutz had posted a picture of the two of them last weekend with the
                        caption <i class="calibre13">The prince and me</i>. Gideon had his arms wrapped around her from
                        behind, her hands clasping his forearm, their faces pressed together, smiling wide.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Baaaaaaabes</i>, Amber Brunati had commented, followed by
                        no less than six heart-eye emojis.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I swallow. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúDeath. That‚Äôs why you scared me. I thought it was the
                        grim reaper sneaking up on me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A grin splits his face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShould I create a diversion?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very good at that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I say, and I can‚Äôt help but sneak a look out into the hallway.
                        Iris is nowhere to be seen. When I look back, Gideon‚Äôs eyes narrow.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou <i class="calibre13">are</i> hiding from someone. Who
                        is it? What did they do? Or what did you do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing. It‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He evaluates me for a moment. ‚ÄúEx-boyfriend?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ha. Will Sorenson graduated with Danforth‚Äôs senior class last year and is
                        thankfully nowhere within state lines. We both use the same server in Battle Quest, and even the
                        chance of seeing him around Aradana is more than enough.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say, and glance around again but not for Iris. ‚ÄúAre you ‚Ä¶ are you
                        meeting someone here or something?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHere behind this statue?‚Äù he says solemnly. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just mean, why are you‚Ä¶‚Äù Talking to me. Of all people.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you auditioning for the play?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to sign in. You want to go sign in?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm. Sure, I guess. Yeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I follow Gideon to the dining hall. He holds the door open for me, and I
                        approach the teacher sitting at a table inside with a sign-in sheet and a sheaf of forms. We
                        have to rank what jobs in the crew we‚Äôd prefer if we‚Äôre not cast, because Iris was
                        right&mdash;we have to work on the production whether or not we get a role in the play. The
                        audition alone guarantees our participation. Funny how they get you like that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I finish my form, Gideon is still bent over his, the tip of his tongue
                        stuck between his teeth as he fills it out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hesitate for a moment, unsure if I‚Äôm supposed to say something to officially
                        end this interaction.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But it was a one-off, I‚Äôm sure of that, so I don‚Äôt say anything. I just turn
                        and head off to a table near the back, having spotted Iris at an empty one in the middle of the
                        room. I pull out a crumpled sheet of paper&mdash;my monologue &mdash;and try to smooth it out
                        against the tabletop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I mouth the first few lines. The words feel strange enough, but then I remember
                        I‚Äôm supposed to put some kind of emotion into it, too. I try to make my face look impassioned.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then Gideon plops down in the seat across from mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat part are you trying for?‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù <i class="calibre13">None of them</i>. ‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be Oberon.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty certain about that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm the best man for the job.‚Äù He smiles, and his cheeks dimple. It makes
                        something in my chest seize uncomfortably. A smile like that could be weaponized.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-91" class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny we haven‚Äôt met before,‚Äù he says when my gaze
                        darts back to my monologue sheet. ‚ÄúDid you transfer?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you go to many of the parties?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I have to stop myself from snorting. ‚ÄúNot many, no.‚Äù And then I can‚Äôt help but
                        say: ‚ÄúWe actually have met before.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He blinks at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAt your birthday, freshman year.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It had been a source of great stress for me at the time. Gideon invited all the
                        girls in our year at PLSG to his fifteenth birthday party at this deluxe arcade.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Most of the people in my class knew him&mdash;they had been in junior high
                        together at Morningbrook Academy&mdash;but I had never met him before. I didn‚Äôt even want to go
                        to the party. But my mom said it would be a good opportunity to get to know the girls at school
                        better. ‚ÄúAnd you never know,‚Äù she said, raising and lowering her eyebrows suggestively. ‚ÄúCould
                        be some cute boys there.‚Äù Her eyes widened. ‚ÄúOoh, or some good party favors!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I did like the idea of good party favors, so I decided to go. But this led to a
                        dilemma.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">What kind of birthday present do you get for a kid you don‚Äôt even know? Who,
                        judging by the elaborate birthday party, probably already had everything he could possibly want?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I ended up giving him a gift card to Outback Steakhouse that my mom had gotten
                        free at work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his fifteenth birthday,‚Äù Mom had said, presenting the card to me with a
                        flourish. ‚ÄúFifteen for fifteen, there you go, problem solved.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It didn‚Äôt seem that simple. In fact, it seemed pretty embarrassing. But come
                        party night, I left it on the gift table all the same.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look at Gideon now, and I know that he has no earthly recollection of me
                        giving him an Outback Steakhouse gift card for his fifteenth birthday. He doesn‚Äôt even remember
                        that I was there. He just blinks at me, friendly and uncomprehending.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd remember meeting you,‚Äù he says, leaning in a bit and flashing me
                        that smile again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He‚Äôs either trying to flirt with me, or he‚Äôs making fun of me. Really only the
                        latter makes sense, so I just blink. ‚ÄúYou actually did, though.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His face falls. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere were like a hundred people there,‚Äù I say, because he looks inexplicably
                        upset, like a little kid who‚Äôs dropped an ice cream cone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-92" class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid you bring me a present? Maybe I‚Äôd remember from
                        that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI, uh. It was a gift card.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTo where?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOutback Steakhouse.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo way. I remember that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo you don‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI do, though. You know why? It‚Äôs because I got a bunch of gift cards from the
                        party, and Noah and I decided to spend them all in one awesome day. It was one of the last
                        places we went. We had just eaten like fifty bucks worth of food at P.F. Chang‚Äôs, but we still
                        had the Outback Steakhouse card, so we went and ordered a Bloomin‚Äô Onion and ate the entire
                        thing, and then we both threw up in the parking lot after. It was epic.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It does not sound epic. But I can‚Äôt help but smile a little. ‚ÄúWell, I guess I
                        made you a memory.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou did!‚Äù he says brightly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs it just me or are there more people here than last year?‚Äù Suddenly Sudha
                        Prabhu is at my elbow, pulling out the chair next to mine. Alicia Smith circles the table and
                        grabs the seat next to Gideon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWorried about the competition?‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAbsolutely not,‚Äù Sudha replies primly. ‚ÄúHi, Claudia.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alicia echoes it. ‚ÄúHi, Claudia. I like your earrings.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks. I like your shirt,‚Äù I say, because we are all wearing the same shirt.
                        She doesn‚Äôt smile, just pokes Gideon lightly on the cheek, right in the spot where his dimple
                        then appears, as if summoned.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Sudha peers at the crumpled monologue sheet in front of me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúInteresting choice,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I frown. There were only three options for audition monologues tacked to the
                        bulletin board outside the drama room. I‚Äôm not sure how it was possible to choose wrong, but
                        apparently I had.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid you practice?‚Äù Sudha asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt, like, actually ‚Ä¶ <i class="calibre13">rehearse</i>,‚Äù I say.
                        ‚ÄúBut I read it, at least. That‚Äôs something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I had tried practicing in the mirror, but I felt ridiculous talking to myself
                        and in the end just kind of gave the whole thing a whispered once-over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Sudha gives me the saddest look, like she‚Äôs somehow cognizant of my pathetic
                        mirror practice. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôll go in there and crush her audition, of course. I‚Äôd expect no less. Sudha
                        was Sandy in <i class="calibre13">Grease</i> last spring, and Emily in <i class="calibre13">Our
                            Town</i> the semester before that. She has a lead role locked down, no matter what the
                        production.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna do great,‚Äù Gideon says.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks, G.‚Äù Sudha beams.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon smiles back, but when Sudha and Alicia start chatting, he points at me
                        and gives me a double thumbs-up, mouthing the words again like they were meant for me: <i
                            class="calibre13">You‚Äôre gonna do great.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile a little and look back at my monologue.</p>

                    <h2>seven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">We get called a few at a time to queue up in the hall outside the band room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Seated inside is the drama teacher at Danforth (Mr. Palmer, I‚Äôm informed) and
                        the freshman lit teacher from PLSG, Ms. Ohlemacher. When it‚Äôs my turn, Mr. Palmer, who‚Äôs
                        directing the show, tells me to start ‚Äúwhenever I‚Äôm ready,‚Äù which is funny, because I‚Äôm quite
                        certain all the practice in the world wouldn‚Äôt make me truly ready.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hate public speaking. I‚Äôm not sure what it is&mdash;there are literally only
                        two people in here, and it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt talk in front of two people&mdash;my
                        parents&mdash;literally every single day. But something about it being structured, and
                        inorganic, makes my stomach twist and my palms sweat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">(‚ÄúIs it because people could be judging me?‚Äù I asked Alex once. ‚ÄúLike, because
                        it‚Äôs an opportunity for me to be judged?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, if it helps, just know that I‚Äôm judging you all the time.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He grinned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm judging you right now.‚Äù)</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hold the monologue sheet up, trying to stop it from rattling in my grasp as I
                        read from it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you think you could do it without the paper?‚Äù Ms. Ohlemacher says gently
                        when I‚Äôm finished.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs have another try at it,‚Äù Mr. Palmer says. ‚ÄúThis time, I want you
                        to really focus on how Titania must feel here. She‚Äôs had a falling out with Oberon, and the
                        world is going haywire as a result of it. She wants peace, but neither of them are willing to
                        give in.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I try it again, try to think how Titania must feel, running into an on-again,
                        off-again boyfriend like that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My hands shake slightly less this time. A marginal improvement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThank you, Claudia,‚Äù Mr. Palmer says when I stumble to a finish.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ms. Ohlemacher gives me a kind smile. ‚ÄúYes, great, thank you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre15">I leave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The next group has assembled outside. Gideon is toward the front, along with
                        Alicia and another guy who I recognize from the first day of school in the Grove. Gideon pushes
                        off the wall when I emerge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow‚Äôd it go?‚Äù he says, holding up one hand. I realize that I‚Äôm supposed to
                        high-five it. ‚ÄúDid you nail it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd go that far.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you did awesome.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">There‚Äôs some misplaced faith</i>. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I say with a
                        tight smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, this is Noah,‚Äù Gideon says, gesturing to the guy behind him, who looks up
                        from his phone. ‚ÄúDo you know Noah Edelman?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the greatest person I know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah reaches out to shake my hand but looks Gideon‚Äôs way. ‚ÄúYou really got to
                        stop billing me like that. People are gonna be disappointed.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou could never disappoint,‚Äù Gideon says, and even though he‚Äôs smiling, I get
                        the feeling he‚Äôs not joking. ‚ÄúNoah‚Äôs my best friend. We shared the Bloomin‚Äô Onion I told you
                        about.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, thanks for sponsoring that parking lot yak,‚Äù Noah says with a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù I say for want of anything better.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And now we‚Äôre just standing awkwardly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo I should probably‚Ä¶‚Äù I gesture over my shoulder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt want to keep you,‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúHopefully we both get cast, then
                        we can hang out at rehearsals.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôve got Oberon locked down.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôll be my queen,‚Äù he says, leaning in a little and wiggling his
                        eyebrows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, probably not. If there‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ a nonspeaking role for a tree or
                        something, that‚Äôll probably be me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Gideon looks suddenly serious. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sell yourself short.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. ‚ÄúYeah. See you guys.‚Äù And I head away.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúAre you going to wear a <i class="calibre13">doublet</i>? Hose? Better yet, are
                        you going to wear one of those Shakespearean collars?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCollars?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike the big accordion-looking neck thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about,‚Äù I say, even though I know exactly
                        what Julia means.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike the thing Shakespeare‚Äôs wearing in literally every picture of Shakespeare
                        ever.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre both online that night, roaming the Aradanian countryside for monsters.
                        I‚Äôve got my phone pressed to my ear while we play. There‚Äôs a text chat function in Battle Quest,
                        but you can‚Äôt talk aloud through the game itself. If there‚Äôs a group of us playing, we usually
                        just do some kind of conference calling online. But if it‚Äôs just me and Julia, we get on the
                        phone like we usually do&mdash;the same way she‚Äôd call me while she‚Äôs grocery shopping or
                        cooking dinner, or I‚Äôd call her while I‚Äôm waiting for a ride or something. We haven‚Äôt lived
                        under the same roof since I was in elementary school, or even in the same city since I started
                        high school, but we manage to snag time together however we can, wherever we can. On the phone,
                        or in Aradana, or both.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shoot off a couple of arrows toward a nearby creature. It turns our way and
                        we start attacking it in earnest. It‚Äôs almost drained when Julia‚Äôs avatar, Selensa Stormtreader,
                        suddenly falls still.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I finish off the creature.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry, Mark just got home.‚Äù I hear muffled conversation and then ‚ÄúHe says hi.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTell him I don‚Äôt say hi back. Tell him I respond with stony silence.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Julia relays the message, and I can hear Mark laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Julia met him when she was a sophomore in college. I was in third grade at the
                        time. He came home with Julia for Christmas that year. I don‚Äôt really remember my first
                        impression of him&mdash;I was more caught up with Disney‚Äôs latest efforts and desperately
                        wanting an American Girl doll. If I knew I was meeting my future brother-in-law, I probably
                        would‚Äôve paid more attention.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre15">Though I do remember he brought Alex and me presents.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just trying to win you over,‚Äù Julia had said when Mark went off with my
                        dad and Alex and I tore into our new loot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs trying to win <i class="calibre13">you</i> over,‚Äù my mom replied with
                        a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They got married three years ago. And now, ‚ÄúOh good Lord,‚Äù Julia mutters. ‚ÄúHe
                        wants to go look at strollers again.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Julia is pregnant, and Mark is unendingly excited. Julia&mdash;although she is
                        the baby-carrying party involved&mdash;is somewhat less enthusiastic.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She texts me about it all the time:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">He wants to pick out nursery colors</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">He won‚Äôt stop reading about breast pumps. I THINK AS THE
                            PERSON BEING PUMPED I SHOULD BE THE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUMPING.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">He‚Äôs highlighting the baby name book.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">We each get five vetoes, I‚Äôve already used four. I‚Äôm gonna
                            need to buy more vetoes.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wouldn‚Äôt understand Julia‚Äôs reluctance if I didn‚Äôt know her, but I do, and I
                        know that she hates change. She gets anxious about the future. And I know that any apprehension
                        on her side is just reflective of that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôve seen her rub her belly when she thinks no one is looking. I‚Äôve seen her
                        gazing at baby shoes at Target.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs part of her shtick, acting grumpy. A little negative. But I know she‚Äôll
                        love that baby, I know how much she‚Äôll care for it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Sweet little Cayenne or Ellipsis or Cherry Blossom or
                            Aquafina.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">I am barely exaggerating, Claude.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI thought we were gonna do a dungeon,‚Äù I say, making Viola Constantinople
                        execute a complicated twirl on-screen because Selensa Stormtreader is still just standing there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, sorry,‚Äù Julia says after more muffled conversation with Mark. ‚ÄúGotta go.
                        Have fun Shakespeare-ing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll try. Hey, if you‚Äôre mean to me, I‚Äôm gonna send Mark a list of names from
                        this play. You could have a little baby Oberon or Hippolyta.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh geez. Don‚Äôt you dare.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBet you wish you saved some of those vetoes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm hanging up now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I grin. ‚ÄúI love you!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a beat, and I think she really has hung up. Then,</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLove you too. Bye.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre15">On the screen, Selensa Stormtreader logs off.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">Zoe and I volunteer at Roosevelt-Hart on Thursday evenings.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs a pediatric rehab facility, which is not&mdash;as Alex has inappropriately
                        joked before&mdash;a place for toddlers on benders. It‚Äôs actually a place for babies and kids
                        who have been released from the hospital but aren‚Äôt well enough to go home yet. Round-the-clock
                        care, physical therapy, etc.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pull up to Zoe‚Äôs house, and she‚Äôs sitting on the front steps, wearing her
                        bright blue Roosevelt-Hart shirt. I‚Äôm wearing an identical one with <i
                            class="calibre13">VOLUNTEER</i> across the back in big white letters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We listen to Drunk Residential, our favorite band, in the car on the way there
                        and sing along.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When we get to Roosevelt-Hart, we sign in at the front (the attractive desk guy
                        smiles at both of us. I manage to get out a too-loud ‚Äúhi‚Äù and an aborted wave, but Zoe chats
                        amiably with him while I check in on the computer). Then we part ways&mdash;Zoe to the rec area,
                        and me to the nursery.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe likes to work with the kids closer to our age. But I volunteered to be in
                        the nursery. I like babies, and maybe part of me thought it would be an easier job.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet when I get in this evening. The lights are dimmed, and most of the
                        little ones are sleeping. But I go up to the crib of a baby named Makenna, and she blinks big
                        eyes back at me. A monitor at her bedside reports her heart rate, connected through a wire to a
                        sensor attached to one of her big toes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCould I hold her?‚Äù I ask the nearest nurse. There‚Äôs an impressive nurse-to-kid
                        ratio here, so there‚Äôs always one close by.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The nurse gets to her feet, reaches in for Makenna&mdash;we‚Äôre not allowed to
                        pick the babies up ourselves&mdash;and gestures to a rocking chair at the foot of her bed. I
                        sit, and she places Makenna in my arms.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôs warm and cuddly and quiet, and I rock her until she falls asleep. Not a
                        bad way to spend an evening.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We started volunteering here last year. As is usually the way, Zoe wanted to,
                        and I followed along. She wants to go to medical school, and apparently volunteering in a
                        ‚Äúclinical setting‚Äù looks good on your r√©sum√©. Zoe is forever trying to get an early leg up on
                        things.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre15">I didn‚Äôt know what kind of hospital Roosevelt-Hart was.
                        That the majority of older kids were there because of brain and spinal cord injuries, and that
                        the majority of babies and toddlers had had surgeries and needed breathing tubes, or suffered
                        from failure to thrive, or were there because their parents couldn‚Äôt care for them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The first night we volunteered, it was dark when Zoe and I left the hospital.
                        We walked across the wide parking lot, in and out of the paths of the parking lot lights.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It was quiet between us until I finally spoke, voicing the thought that had
                        been running through my mind all evening.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can do this,‚Äù I said, slowing to a stop in front of the car.
                        Zoe crossed around to the passenger side, but neither of us got in. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can come
                        back here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shook my head. I was trying not to cry, and my throat ached with it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just.‚Äù Blink. Swallow. ‚ÄúSad.‚Äù Swallow again, around the massive lump.
                        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so fucking sad, Zoe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looked at me for a moment, but her face betrayed nothing. Zoe could be so
                        incredibly ‚Ä¶ placid sometimes. Unreadable. I didn‚Äôt feel like she was judging me&mdash;I knew
                        her well enough to know that she wouldn‚Äôt&mdash;but I couldn‚Äôt tell what she was thinking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, it is,‚Äù she said finally, nodding. ‚ÄúBut feeling bad won‚Äôt help anyone.
                        You or them. Pity‚Äôs not gonna help.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know.‚Äù A few tears slipped out, and I rushed to catch them, pushing up the
                        side of my glasses, so half of Zoe was blurry when I looked back at her. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt help it.
                        It‚Äôs not fair. Why do people have to go through that? Why do&mdash;<i
                            class="calibre13">kids</i>&mdash;have to go through that? It sucks. Everything about it
                        sucks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut there are places like this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd doctors and nurses and ‚Ä¶ and
                        volunteers and stuff, to help take care of them and help them get better. That doesn‚Äôt suck,
                        does it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shook my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs kind of awesome actually,‚Äù she said, looking back at the
                        building. It was a pretty new facility with a modern design, lots of windows. The lights from
                        the lobby lit it up like a jewel box, glowing through the darkness. ‚ÄúIt makes me feel good, to
                        be a part of that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre just stronger than me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her gaze returned to me, and she shook her head. ‚ÄúBullshit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can do it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù she said again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We didn‚Äôt say much more on the ride home. By the time we reached her house, I
                        was more or less composed. We said good night, she went inside, and I drove home. We didn‚Äôt talk
                        about it again after that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The following Thursday, I put my Roosevelt-Hart shirt on and drove to Zoe‚Äôs to
                        pick her up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She didn‚Äôt comment on it, but she was already waiting for me on the front
                        porch, wearing her own blue shirt, so I knew she already knew I was coming. That I would go
                        back, despite what I said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She glances over at me tonight as I pull to a stop at a red light. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you mean, what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking really loudly.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, I just‚Ä¶‚Äù I shake my head. ‚ÄúI was thinking about the play. They‚Äôre
                        posting the cast list tomorrow.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOoh, your dramatic debut.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine. You‚Äôll do great.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I have no doubt she believes it. Zoe has always had faith in me, even when I
                        wasn‚Äôt sure if I deserved it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The light turns green. I press the gas, and we go.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">The cast list is posted outside the PLSG music room the next morning. Apparently
                        there are no nonspeaking tree roles in <i class="calibre13">A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream</i>, so I
                        find my name toward the bottom, in a list headed in big bold letters with the word <i
                            class="calibre13">Crew</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Only the girls‚Äô list is posted here. I wonder briefly if Gideon Prewitt secured
                        the role of Oberon as my eyes catch on a few of the other names on the list.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Titania</i>: Paige Breckner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Hermia</i>: Sudha Prabhu. No surprise there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Helena</i>: Lena Ideker. An interesting choice, to be
                        sure. I didn‚Äôt know Lena‚Äôs interests skewed toward Shakespeare.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And toward the bottom, <i class="calibre13">First Fairy</i>: Iris Huang.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Huh. Who‚Äôd have thought. For all of Iris‚Äôs ire, I guess she did a halfway
                        decent audition. Better than me, at least, though that wouldn‚Äôt have been tough.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre all meant to meet in the auditorium at Danforth after school. I guess
                        that‚Äôs when I‚Äôll find out what exactly crew entails.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Painting scenery and stuff?</i> Zoe texts me at lunch. <i
                            class="calibre13">Operating the spotlight? Hey, maybe you‚Äôll open and close the curtain.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">I could handle that. Could build up some upper body
                            strength at least.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">You‚Äôre gonna get so ripped,</i> Zoe replies.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre13">A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream</i> is really an ensemble show.
                        There‚Äôs no singular main character or narrator but a few different groups of characters, all of
                        equal importance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">First there‚Äôs the court&mdash;the Duke and his lady Hippolyta, as well as some
                        royal hangers-on, who conveniently turn up at the beginning and the end of the show to set the
                        scene, add commentary, and pass judgment.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre15">Then there are the lovers&mdash;Hermia, Lysander, Helena,
                        and Demetrius. Hermia and Lysander are madly in love, Demetrius is into Hermia despite it being
                        an entire no-go on Hermia‚Äôs side, and Helena is hopelessly into Demetrius, despite it being an
                        entire no-go on Demetrius‚Äôs side.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Next there are the Mechanicals&mdash;a rough-and-tumble group of people tasked
                        with putting on a play for the Duke‚Äôs impending wedding. And last there are the
                        Fairies&mdash;the King, Oberon, and the Queen, Titania, and their respective crews.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Oberon and Titania are fighting, and the world is all out of whack because of
                        it. Meanwhile, Hermia and Lysander run away to get married when Hermia‚Äôs dad says she has to
                        marry Demetrius. Demetrius follows them into the woods because he can‚Äôt take no for an answer,
                        and Helena follows him because neither can she.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This all leads to some capital-H Hijinks, and then when things are sorted,
                        there‚Äôs a play-within-a-play at the end that the Mechanicals put on, and it‚Äôs all good fun.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I heard through the grapevine that Gideon Prewitt had indeed secured the role
                        of Oberon. And although in theory Noah Edelman probably would‚Äôve been a good candidate for
                        Oberon‚Äôs magical sidekick, Puck, Noah would be playing Nick Bottom, the head Mechanical who
                        thinks he‚Äôs an amazing actor and unwittingly gets turned into a donkey. Or a partial donkey, at
                        least. Donkey from the neck up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Everyone is gathering in the first few rows of the auditorium before the start
                        of rehearsal. I spot Gideon and Noah down front with Sudha, Alicia, and Lena.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I take a seat as far back as I can get and still look involved, and I crack
                        open my copy of the play while we wait for everyone to assemble. I haven‚Äôt been sitting long
                        when someone clears their throat behind me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance around. Iris is now seated two rows back, glaring right at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">What could I have possibly done? I‚Äôm literally just sitting here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I face forward. But Iris clears her throat again, and when I turn back to her,
                        she gestures toward the stage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDown front,‚Äù she says pointedly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look ahead. Gideon has turned around in his seat and is waving at me. He
                        smiles and then gestures like he wants me to join him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There are people on either side of him, people that I‚Äôm not great friends with,
                        and it would be so weird to just ‚Ä¶ <i class="calibre13">insert</i> myself in there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon sticks out his bottom lip in a pout, and I crack a smile. But then his
                        attention is drawn somewhere over my shoulder. I think for a moment that he‚Äôs looking at Iris,
                        but then Paige walks swiftly down the aisle next to us, raising a hand toward Gideon, who grins
                        broadly, all pretense of pout gone. He says something to Noah, who gets up and moves to Alicia‚Äôs
                        other side, and Paige takes his vacated seat. The King and Queen of Fairies united. Gideon
                        starts talking to Paige, and I am forgotten.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre15">I glance back at Iris. Her face is arranged in an
                        impressive scowl.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she snaps.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I face forward again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Ms. Ohlemacher and Mr. Palmer make some opening remarks, have us all introduce
                        ourselves, and then divide us into cast and crew.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ms. Ohlemacher is in charge of the crew. There are about twenty of us who
                        assemble backstage while the actors gather onstage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We get our crew assignments based on what we said on the sign-in form at
                        auditions. I had ranked costumes one, scenery two, and lighting three. After Ms. Ohlemacher
                        rattles off a list of names for set building, she looks up from her clipboard and says, ‚ÄúFor
                        costumes we‚Äôve got Claudia Wallace and Caris Pearlman.‚Äù Caris grins back at me from a few rows
                        ahead. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be working with Delilah; she‚Äôs designing for the show.‚Äù She gestures to Delilah,
                        who nods at Caris and then turns and looks at me with a short dip of her head, eyes serious.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Delilah Legere, or Del as everyone calls her, is actually one of the first
                        people I met at PLSG. She sat in front of me in freshman English.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We aren‚Äôt friends, but we‚Äôre cool, I guess. I wouldn‚Äôt say PLSG is cliquey, per
                        se, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it <i class="calibre13">isn‚Äôt</i> cliquey either, and somehow, if I had
                        to pick two girls in our class&mdash;in the whole school, even&mdash;who didn‚Äôt somehow fit in
                        with any of the cliques, it would be Del and myself. So we share that, at least.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Unlike me, though, the thing about Del is that she‚Äôs basically just too cool
                        for it. She has friends in college. She does all sorts of interesting stuff outside of school.
                        And she‚Äôs so focused on getting into design school, I guess she doesn‚Äôt have much time to waste
                        at the parties and the luncheons and the rest. She certainly wasn‚Äôt at Amber Brunati‚Äôs Pink
                        Party. Though I would love to see what she would‚Äôve worn. She definitely has a signature style.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can handle making costumes for Del.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI assume you both can sew?‚Äù she says, looking from me to Caris after the crew
                        has further divided up into our respective areas.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, I like to make costumes,‚Äù Caris says. ‚ÄúMe and Robbie do cosplay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúPrecious,‚Äù Del says. ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. ‚ÄúMy grandma taught me. It was a ‚Ä¶ bonding-type activity.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre15">Del‚Äôs expression says that this kind of information is
                        superfluous.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll meet after school starting next week,‚Äù Del says, ‚Äúat the multimedia
                        studio. It‚Äôs in the basement of this building. That‚Äôll be our costume shop. I‚Äôve already got
                        designs worked up. We need to get supplies, take measurements, get started on construction. Lots
                        to do. Are you with me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAye aye, captain!‚Äù Caris says, smiling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del‚Äôs lips twitch, like she might almost smile back. ‚ÄúExcellent.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I cut back through the Grove to get to the PLSG parking lot after we break for
                        the day. Alex is supposed to come pick me up since Dad headed home when classes got out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Footsteps crunch through the brush behind me. I glance back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not following you,‚Äù Iris says sharply. ‚ÄúAs if I would follow you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know.‚Äù I point to the group of sophomore girls on the path up ahead of us.
                        ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not following them either. We all happen to be going back to the same place.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt slow down. And I don‚Äôt think Iris is picking up her pace, but somehow
                        she ends up nearer, almost in step with me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo what are you doing on the show anyway?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance over at her, surprised. An actual question, unsolicited.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCostumes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris snorts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, it makes sense. I figured you‚Äôd do something that requires little to no
                        skill.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That, of all things, breaks me. Or maybe it‚Äôs just the one thing added to the
                        massive pile of other things that finally tips the scales.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy do you have to do that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre basically alone now, distance stretching between us and the group of
                        sophomores up ahead, so there‚Äôs no one around to witness it if Iris Huang actually succeeds in
                        making me cry. The words just come out: ‚ÄúWhy do you have to be so mean? Seriously, what do you
                        get out of it? Is it, like, a rush of endorphins? Is there some chemical released in your head
                        when you‚Äôre a dick to people? Would your brain light up in the same places as a heroin addict
                        getting a fix?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My voice doesn‚Äôt waver. I manage to keep it together.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And somehow, inexplicably, Iris just responds with a huff of laughter.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre15">I‚Äôm so shocked, all I can do is blink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThat was funny.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt supposed to be funny.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, it was.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt know what to say to that, so I don‚Äôt say anything at all. I just turn
                        and head off through the Grove, moving quickly enough to leave Iris behind.</p>

                    <h2>eleven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">British lit finds us with another assignment the next week. We‚Äôre supposed to
                        find ‚Äúcritique partners‚Äù to review each other‚Äôs papers. The mad flurry starts, but I know better
                        this time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I turn to Sam, but before I can grab her attention, Iris appears and drops a
                        notebook down in front of me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWrite your number,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink at her. I don‚Äôt know how she moved across the room that fast.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe need to exchange numbers if we‚Äôre going to work on this outside of school,‚Äù
                        she says slowly, like I‚Äôm stupid.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWho said we were partners?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris glances around. ‚ÄúEveryone else has paired up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And it‚Äôs true. By now, everyone has.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe need to show Dennings we can work together,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo this is some kind of ‚Ä¶ redemption arc?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWrite your number down, for Christ‚Äôs sake.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe I don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris looks at me for a moment and then up at the ceiling. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù It seems
                        like the word physically pains her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Inwardly, I sigh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then I write down my number.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I go to the appointed place in the basement of the Danforth arts building after
                        school to meet Del. It‚Äôs a multipurpose kind of studio&mdash;there are big craft tables, some
                        sewing machines, computers, some woodworking equipment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Big bulletin boards line one wall of the room. When I arrive, Del is pinning
                        sketches to one of the boards. She glances back when I approach.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not staying long,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to the thrift store.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúField trip?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre15">‚ÄúA working trip.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pick up one of the closest sketches not yet pinned up. It shows a figure in a
                        sort of hoop-looking petticoat, wearing a cutoff blazer and fingerless gloves, with aviator
                        goggles around their head, sort of like Amelia Earhart. <i class="calibre13">MUSTARDSEED</i> is
                        printed in all caps underneath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure what kind of fairies we were going with,‚Äù I say when Del catches
                        me looking. ‚ÄúYou know, Tinker Bell or, like, bug people?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNeither,‚Äù Del says. ‚ÄúMr. Palmer wants to set the show in the present day.‚Äù She
                        points to sketches of Hermia and Lysander, already tacked up. Hermia is wearing a cute white
                        dress with a little jacket over it. Lysander has on black skinny jeans and a motorcycle jacket.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut the fairies will be kind of ‚Ä¶ out of time,‚Äù Del continues, pointing to
                        Titania and Oberon and Mustardseed, still in my hands. ‚ÄúA mix of clothes from a bunch of
                        different periods, like they‚Äôve picked up stuff along the way, and they‚Äôve lived so long, it‚Äôs
                        from all different times.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del actually smiles. ‚ÄúI know, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Caris joins us, we set off to the thrift store. Del gives us each a list
                        of items to track down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFun!‚Äù Caris says, beaming. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a scavenger hunt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look through mine quickly. Some are more generic items, like <i
                            class="calibre13">assorted T-shirts (any size/color), white button-down (one each men‚Äôs and
                            women‚Äôs), flannel shirt</i>, while some are more specific, like <i class="calibre13">ugly
                            bridesmaid dress,</i> and <i class="calibre13">yellow raincoat.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow do we know what size?‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt even got measurements from
                        people yet.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôll probably end up deconstructing most of this stuff
                        anyway.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So we set off on our scavenger hunt. Caris is right&mdash;it actually is kind
                        of fun.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She and I are sifting through a bin of neckties (<i class="calibre13">twenty
                            neckties&mdash;greens, golds, and browns</i>) when she glances up at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGuess what.‚Äù Caris‚Äôs eyes shine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúRobbie said Gideon was asking about you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I frown. ‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know. Just. <i class="calibre13">About</i> you.‚Äù She raises and lowers her
                        eyebrows emphatically.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I think of the Oberon sketch tacked up on the bulletin board. A great cloak, a
                        head scarf, big black boots. The figure Del drew didn‚Äôt have a face, but it somehow captured
                        that Gideon Prewitt swagger, as if she designed it expressly with him in mind, even before the
                        part was his.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs probably just&mdash;‚Äù I shrug. ‚ÄúYou know.
                        Being polite.‚Äù I fish a gold-patterned necktie out of the bin and add it to our pile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOr he likes you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That doesn‚Äôt quite compute. I shake my head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not his type.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs not my type,‚Äù I amend, because Caris is generous and probably
                        genuinely believes that someone like Gideon Prewitt could actually like me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù She looks up from the bin, eyes dancing. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know though. He may
                        be a little ridiculous sometimes, but something about him works on everyone.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs then that Del walks past with a shockingly ugly tulle bridesmaid dress in
                        her arms. ‚ÄúLess talking, more finding,‚Äù she says. Then she pauses. ‚ÄúAnd for the record, it
                        doesn‚Äôt work on me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Caris grins. ‚ÄúNoted.‚Äù And we get back to sorting.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I made the mistake of mentioning it to my mom, who was just as enthusiastic

                        the irony of once again telling me it‚Äôll be ‚Äúa great chance to get to know some of the girls at

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt was just an open-invite thing. I really don‚Äôt think anyone will notice if I

                    <p class="calibre15">My mom raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIs that a problem?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, yeah, it kind of goes against my usual thing.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">That wasn‚Äôt exactly how I recalled it. But it didn‚Äôt seem like I was going to

                    <p id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre15">So I find myself at a climbing gym on Friday night. I‚Äôve
                        never been to one before, but I‚Äôd hazard a guess that this one is pretty deluxe. It‚Äôs a giant
                        warehouse with climbing walls bordering the interior and structures set up in the middle for
                        what Keara Shelton, standing in front of me in line to pay, informs me are for <i
                            class="calibre13">bouldering</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo ropes,‚Äù she says with a grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Those of us who haven‚Äôt climbed before have to take training on how to belay.
                        To my surprise, Iris is here, and she‚Äôs among this group, too, hanging at the edges. We get
                        paired up with the person standing next to us, so she gets Kaitlyn Winthrop, who‚Äôs playing
                        another one of the fairies, and I get a guy named Corey, who‚Äôs in the crew.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then we‚Äôre turned loose in the gym. The people who‚Äôve been before are already
                        climbing&mdash;I see Paige hanging from one wall while Gideon stands below, belaying her. Noah
                        Edelman is next to him, chatting with Gideon. Gideon is laughing at whatever Noah‚Äôs saying, but
                        his head stays tilted up, eyeing Paige‚Äôs progress.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Do not take your eyes off the climber,</i> the
                        surprisingly stern college kid who trained us had said. <i class="calibre13">Do not get
                            distracted. Do not take your hands off the rope. Do not lose focus.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars,‚Äù I had whispered to Corey,
                        but he didn‚Äôt laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Corey has headed off and joined a group of guys already at the wall, so I
                        glance around for a new partner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris is still standing where the beginners‚Äô group was assembled. She‚Äôs watching
                        Gideon watching Paige with a decidedly stormy look on her face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I say to her. Everyone else has already paired off or headed to the
                        bouldering walls. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs climb.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúI hate everything about this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris, you haven‚Äôt even climbed as high as you are tall.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLet me down. Now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou could literally just step off the wall.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris does, but there‚Äôs not enough slack (I‚Äôm a good belayer, actually), so she
                        just hangs uncomfortably in the harness, her toes brushing the mat. I fumble with the rope and
                        she drops down fully to her feet, then flops onto the ground like she‚Äôs completely winded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I laugh. I can‚Äôt help it. Iris glares.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to see you try,‚Äù she says, but it‚Äôs not quite as cutting as usual.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre15">Iris has to clip in to belay me so I don‚Äôt launch her
                        into the air. Once she‚Äôs anchored, I pick a relatively easy path and have at it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Surprisingly, I like it. Reaching for the next hold, pushing up with my legs ‚Ä¶
                        it feels good. The muscles in my arms burn, but in a strangely pleasant sort of way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm just over halfway to the top when there‚Äôs a whoop from below. I glance over
                        my shoulder and see that Gideon has joined Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhooooo!‚Äù he calls again. ‚ÄúClimbin‚Äô Claudia! Owning that wall!‚Äù He starts to
                        do a dance with jazz hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDancing for moral support.‚Äù He executes an awkward turn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI won‚Äôt see you dancing if I go back to climbing,‚Äù I say, gripping the holds.
                        I‚Äôm a little nervous to let go, to lean back into the harness and just dangle. It‚Äôs not that I
                        don‚Äôt trust Iris. But.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know that I‚Äôm dancing,‚Äù Gideon calls back. ‚ÄúIris will commentate.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile at the wall. Shake out one hand, then the other. Then I keep climbing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hear some hushed conversation from below, and then ‚ÄúGideon‚Äôs spinning,‚Äù Iris
                        calls flatly. Like there was an argument she‚Äôs clearly lost. ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs doing some ‚Ä¶ weird
                        shuffle thing&mdash;that‚Äôs not a moonwalk, you‚Äôre high if you think you‚Äôre moonwalking right
                        now. Now he‚Äôs doing like a sort of ‚Ä¶ bouncy kick line.‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I say, grinning as I reach for the next hold. ‚ÄúI feel properly
                        encouraged, thanks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I make it to the top and Gideon cheers. Iris lets me back down in a jerky
                        fashion that‚Äôs got the harness digging uncomfortably into the flesh of my hips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I get to the ground, I flop down like Iris did, leaning back on my hands,
                        but I feel like I‚Äôve actually earned it. I‚Äôve worked up a decent sweat, strands of hair coming
                        out of my ponytail.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGood job!‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúI tried to get Iris to do the wave with me, but she
                        said if she did, it would kill you, so we opted not to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúProbably a good call.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris unclips herself. She‚Äôs looking off across the gym, but there‚Äôs something
                        close to a smile on her face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you guys friends from junior high?‚Äù I ask Iris after Gideon has high-fived
                        us both and gone back to join Noah, who is sitting with Alicia on a metal bench in the middle of
                        the room. Neither has climbed yet. Alicia‚Äôs hair and makeup are spotless, and her workout
                        clothes look runway-ready.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúI mean, I know him from school, yeah. But not ‚Ä¶ friends. We
                        were lab partners in eighth grade. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù Something in her expression softens marginally. She
                        doesn‚Äôt finish.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-107" class="calibre15">‚ÄúA good egg?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat the hell does that mean?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù It‚Äôs something my mom would say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I try a couple more paths after that&mdash;Iris begrudgingly belaying
                        me&mdash;but they‚Äôre much tougher, and I don‚Äôt make it to the top again. Iris doesn‚Äôt even try
                        to get back on the wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris has gone to the bathroom and I‚Äôm eyeing a new path when I hear someone
                        call out from above. Just a few ropes away, Kristina Freeman, who‚Äôs playing another one of the
                        fairies, is clinging to the wall about fifteen feet up. Pete Salata, one of the Mechanicals, is
                        standing below.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI want to come down,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù he says with a grin. ‚ÄúYou have to get to the top first.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúPete, seriously.‚Äù Even from here I can see Kristina‚Äôs arms trembling under the
                        force of clinging to the wall. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it, I want to come down.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou just need to try harder.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not kidding&mdash;‚Äù There‚Äôs panic creeping into her voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf I let you down, you won‚Äôt learn anything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey&mdash;‚Äù I start to say, stepping toward him, but out of nowhere, Noah
                        Edelman beats me to it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúPete. My dude. How about you let her off the wall because she fucking asked
                        you to?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow about you mind your own damn business?‚Äù Pete says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon crosses over then, stands next to Noah. He‚Äôs a good bit taller than both
                        him and Pete.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he asks, looking between the two of them, brow furrowed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing. Jesus,‚Äù Pete says, and then fumbles with the belay device. The rope
                        jerks, and Kristina drops a foot or so abruptly and lets out a yelp. ‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù Pete calls, and
                        manages to lower her the rest of the way more smoothly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Kristina‚Äôs feet hit the ground, she stumbles a bit but Gideon is right
                        there, grabbing on to her elbows to hold her upright. She looks close to tears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all good,‚Äù Gideon says quietly. ‚ÄúBack on solid ground.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like it,‚Äù Kristina says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo harm in that. Let‚Äôs shake those arms out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJust to be clear,‚Äù I hear Noah say to Pete, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre an asshole.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know, he‚Äôs not always gonna be around to back you up,‚Äù Pete replies, his
                        smile at odds with the edge in his voice.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre15">Gideon has started shaking his own arms out, waving them
                        in the air like one of those crazy dancing noodles at a used-car lot. Kristina lets out a weak
                        laugh and then a more genuine one as he starts dancing around in a circle, arms still flailing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah. He is,‚Äù Noah replies evenly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I‚Äôm taking off my harness and shoes to turn them back in at the end of the
                        evening when Gideon approaches me again. He‚Äôs spent most of the night with Paige and Noah and
                        Alicia, but he bounds up to me now like we‚Äôre old friends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, do you know Jacob Dolby?‚Äù he says like he‚Äôs going to introduce us, but
                        there‚Äôs no Jacob Dolby in sight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs having a party tomorrow night.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGood for him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be fun. You should come by.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He‚Äôs got the dimples on display. It‚Äôs a particularly flirty smile, and he seems
                        as if he‚Äôs aware of its effectiveness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, maybe,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI can text you the info.‚Äù He fishes his phone out of his pocket and extends it
                        toward me. I pause for a moment but then take it and type my number in. ‚ÄúOr I could come pick
                        you up if you want?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I can drive.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCool. Well, I‚Äôll see you there.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I say as he backs away, flashing me a double thumbs-up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBye, Iris!‚Äù he calls, shooting her a grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She just snorts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I say, turning to look at her when Gideon has rejoined Noah, gathering
                        their things to leave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris and I end up walking out together. Well, not <i
                            class="calibre13">together</i>, exactly, but close enough that she‚Äôs forced to pause and
                        hold the door open for me. Most of the cast and crew have left by now, the parking lot emptying
                        out as the place prepares to close for the night. I start toward my car, but Iris lingers by the
                        front door, pulling out her phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCalling a ride. What does it look like I‚Äôm doing?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a car?‚Äù Most of the girls in our class do.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt drive,‚Äù she says primly, pressing the phone to her ear.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you&mdash;‚Äù I take a deep breath. ‚ÄúDo you want me to

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not a terrible person?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks at me for a moment and then lowers her phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFine. You can drive me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally? Thank you. How gracious. What a privilege.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her lips twitch a little, almost a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you need my address for the GPS?‚Äù she asks, following me to my car.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHate to break it to you, but 2004 Toyota Corollas don‚Äôt come standard with

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs silent on the ride to Iris‚Äôs house, in between her clipped directions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClimbing was fun,‚Äù I say eventually, even though I know Iris didn‚Äôt find
                        climbing particularly fun. ‚ÄúGood ‚Ä¶ bonding activity.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks over at me sharply. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt bond.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ fuck up on purpose.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWait, so you were for real?‚Äù Iris just blinks at me. ‚ÄúYou making faces in the
                        dining hall before auditions. That was ‚Ä¶ you acting?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat can I say. We‚Äôre not all talented enough to be Magic Fairy Number Five.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm <i class="calibre13">First Fairy</i>. It‚Äôs a named character. I have
                        lines.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh geez, let me get the Tony nominators on the phone.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance over at Iris. She doesn‚Äôt smile, but for a moment I think she might.
                        Until her expression darkens.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a fairy. They all ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm supposed to‚Ä¶‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúAlmost all
                        my scenes are with Paige.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt know what to say&mdash;if I should act like I didn‚Äôt notice Iris
                        sneaking glances at Paige all evening, or just come out and acknowledge it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I decide to go for it. ‚ÄúDo you still like her?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There is a split second where I think Iris might Hulk out of her seat and crush
                        me. But then:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI love her,‚Äù she says, quiet. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just turn it off like that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ have to be weird between you two.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat would you know about it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing, I just&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got tons of exes,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBeing the pinnacle of charm that
                        you are.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you want to walk home from here?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, so that was your plan. Get me in the car and then abandon me somewhere.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt sound like she‚Äôs joking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a plan, there was no <i class="calibre13">plan</i>. Not
                        everything is malicious. Not everyone thinks the way you do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot everything I think is malicious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat would a pie chart of your malicious to non-malicious thoughts look like?
                        How big a piece of the pie is non-malicious?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know, I think I liked it better when you were afraid of me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI was not <i class="calibre13">afraid</i> of you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes you were.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs afraid of me. Everyone avoids me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre afraid. Maybe it just means they don‚Äôt like you.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris doesn‚Äôt answer, and I feel instant regret. We were doing okay. Iris just
                        said she loved Paige. Iris Huang used the word <i class="calibre13">love</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I glance over at her at a red light, she doesn‚Äôt look angry. Just ‚Ä¶
                        contemplative, I guess.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a left at the next turn,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The next turn takes us onto a road with fancy pillared streetlights lining each
                        side, and we are on it for a bit before I realize that it is in fact the driveway to Iris‚Äôs
                        house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">At the end of the drive is the largest mansion I‚Äôve ever seen in real life.
                        Bigger than Amber Brunati‚Äôs. Bigger than Lena Ideker‚Äôs, or Mikayla Jackson‚Äôs, whose birthday
                        party I went to in tenth grade and whose mother manages a hedge fund.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance over at Iris as I pull through the circle drive to the front of the
                        house and come to a stop. She doesn‚Äôt look over or say thanks. She gets out and shuts the door
                        behind her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nevertheless, I wait until Iris gets inside before driving off. Because that‚Äôs
                        what you‚Äôre supposed to do when you drop someone off. Even if you drop them off in front of a
                        house roughly the size of a shopping mall. Even if you‚Äôre not exactly friends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris doesn‚Äôt look back.</p>

                    <h2>thirteen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">My phone dings the next morning:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Jacob Dolby party 8PM see you there!!!!!!!!!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">An address follows, along with a startling array of emojis.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs that Zoe?‚Äù Alex says, looking up from the couch where he‚Äôs flipping through
                        the dearth of Saturday morning programming. ‚ÄúTell her she should come over.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo? Who else could it be?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI have other friends,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTell Julia I say hi.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Julia either!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex just smirks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have to work?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot right now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHm.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex keeps odd hours. He works at a grocery store and also picks up random
                        shifts as a busboy when he can, all the while taking classes at Springdale Community College
                        toward his associate‚Äôs degree.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs not that he didn‚Äôt get into college, because he did. He got into a couple
                        state schools last spring. But his grades were thoroughly average, and he couldn‚Äôt get a
                        scholarship. My parents gave him two options&mdash;either take out loans, or go to community
                        college, get his Gen Ed requirements out of the way, save up money, and then transfer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He didn‚Äôt know I was privy to that conversation, but I was&mdash;our house
                        isn‚Äôt huge, and positioned at the top of the stairs, you can hear everything anyone says in the
                        living room below.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Through the spindles of the banister, I could see Alex standing in the doorway.
                        My dad had muted the TV.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt have come as a surprise, Alex,‚Äù my mom said. ‚ÄúWe talked about it
                        last year, we talked about it the year before. I don‚Äôt know what you expected.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre15">Dad chimed in before Alex could: ‚ÄúWe made it clear, bud.
                        We‚Äôve always made it clear. If you want to go to college, you either get scholarships, or you
                        take out loans. No one‚Äôs saying you can‚Äôt go. But you‚Äôve got to be responsible for yourself
                        here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I couldn‚Äôt see Alex‚Äôs face, but the line of his shoulders was tense.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat about Claude?‚Äù he said finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I startled a bit, which was silly, because no one could see me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat about her?‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúShe knows she‚Äôs responsible for herself, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat about the money you pay for her to go to Prospect?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs different.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause of Daddy‚Äôs job,‚Äù Mom said patiently. ‚ÄúYou know the tuition is on a big
                        fat discount&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut not entirely. You still pay part of it. So how is that different? How can
                        you shell that out for Claude, but you can‚Äôt help me here? Money that you could‚Äôve paid for me
                        to get an actual college degree, you‚Äôre paying for Claude to go to high school. It‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ fucked
                        up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúAlex.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt is. It‚Äôs not fair. And don‚Äôt say ‚Äòlife‚Äôs not fair.‚Äô You always say that.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true, though.‚Äù Dad‚Äôs voice was firm. ‚ÄúAnd frankly ‚Ä¶ Claudia earned it. We
                        get the tuition break because of my job, but Claude had to be accepted into PLSG all on her own.
                        It‚Äôs very competitive, and she had the grades, she put in the time, she got in. Whereas‚Ä¶‚Äù He
                        sighed. ‚ÄúAl, I‚Äôm sorry, I hate to say it, but if you had devoted more time to school like your
                        sister has, we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation, would we?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis is bullshit,‚Äù Alex said finally, and turned away. I stood up fast and
                        raced into my room before he could see me there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I heard his door slam. When I went back into the hallway, I saw several
                        crumpled sheets of paper on the floor in front of his room. I picked them up, turned one over:
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Dear Mr. Wallace, It is our pleasure to offer you a place
                            in the incoming class at Illinois State University.‚Ä¶</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I knocked on his door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGo away.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know, go away.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I swallowed. ‚ÄúDo you want my car money?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-112" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I cracked the door, stuck my head in. Alex‚Äôs room was perpetually messy, full
                        of books and unfolded clothes. ‚ÄúMy car money,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou could use it for school.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He was lying on the bed, and his face&mdash;sunk into a scowl&mdash;softened
                        slightly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaude, your car money would barely pay for a semester.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said, leaning against the doorframe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú‚ÄôCause you‚Äôre right. They do pay for me to go to Prospect.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. It‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ I just wish things were
                        different. I wish I was smarter.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou are smart.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd tried harder.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you gonna do?‚Äù I asked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He shook his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I think it was difficult for him&mdash;first graduation season, seeing where
                        everyone was headed. Then this summer, watching his friends pack up and leave one by one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But he kept working. He enrolled at Springdale Community College. He‚Äôs moving
                        forward.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Right now he changes the channel again and glances at me while I save Gideon‚Äôs
                        number to my phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFor real, tell Julia to get online.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Julia,‚Äù I say, and hover over the message for a moment, trying to
                        decide if I should I reply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I decide against it and flop down on the couch next to Alex, reaching for the
                        remote.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it,‚Äù he says.</p>

                        Danforth&ndash;PLSG social director apparent, must invite dozens of people to parties every
                        week.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm just ‚Ä¶ kinda wiped. Sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The background noise changes, like Gideon is moving through a crowd, and then
                        it lessens considerably.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo worries. What did you do today?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat has you so wiped.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh. You know. Saturday stuff.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Saturday stuff? Typical Saturday for Claudia Wallace.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. I didn‚Äôt know he knew my last name. I think of what Caris told me at
                        Goodwill&mdash;<i class="calibre13">Robbie said Gideon was asking about you.</i></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre15">‚ÄúI ran a 5K,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally.‚Äù He says it like he might believe me, so I go on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúActually, I ran twelve 5Ks. Basically a 60K. And then I fought like seven
                        bears. So. You know, I‚Äôm pretty beat.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSeven bears. All at once?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, three and then four.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impressive. I‚Äôve only ever fought seven bears tournament-style.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it was easy. That‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so tired.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He huffs a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you really do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I did homework. I went to the grocery store with my dad to get the frozen pizza
                        we ate for dinner. My family is currently watching a several-years-old weepy romance movie based
                        on a weepy romance novel that my mom liked. And in between:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI, uh. I was playing a game. Battle Quest? Do you know it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a moment I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll scoff or hang up immediately, but he does neither
                        of those things. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù he says easily. ‚ÄúWhat kind of game is it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAn MMORPG, like Final Fantasy or WoW, but it‚Äôs a lot newer. It‚Äôs not that
                        popular yet, but my sister and her husband are really into it. They got me into it, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat sounds very cool,‚Äù Gideon says without a hint of irony. ‚ÄúVery
                        interesting.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an MM-something-something?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúA massively multiplayer online role-playing game. It‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ where you design
                        a character, and you do tasks&mdash;quests and stuff&mdash;that are part of a larger story arc.
                        You pick a server when you sign up and then you can interact with anyone who‚Äôs playing on that
                        server, too. It can be people from all over the world. It‚Äôs cool because it‚Äôs not like a video
                        game that has a start and a finish that you play all the way through. I mean, there‚Äôs the story
                        arc, but it‚Äôs more about‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I realize how much I am talking about this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù Gideon says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Like ‚Ä¶ inhabiting the world, I guess?‚Äù To me, it‚Äôs not so much a
                        game that you play but a place that you go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you&mdash;shouldn‚Äôt you get back to the party?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, I bring the party with me wherever I go.‚Äù And then, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the first
                        lyric off my mixtape, just FYI,‚Äù he says when I don‚Äôt respond.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm fairly sure he‚Äôs joking, but at the same time, he thought I was the kind of
                        person who could run a 5K.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo ‚Ä¶ what did you do today?‚Äù I ask for lack of anything
                        better.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaudia Wallace, you‚Äôre not even a little bit curious about my mixtape?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm like sixty-five percent sure you don‚Äôt have one.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called <i class="calibre13">Gideon Prewitt: Getting Improvement</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAgh, God, why?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause it sounds cool.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú<i class="calibre13">Getting Improvement</i>? What does that even mean?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to <i class="calibre13">mean</i> anything, it just has to
                        strike a chord with people.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm now eighty percent sure this mixtape doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut the other twenty percent of you is imagining the cover art, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A pause. Before I can think of a response, he goes on:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a close-up of an iguana wearing a Christmas sweater.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Gideon says after a moment‚Äôs silence, ‚ÄúI know I blew it with the whole
                        you being at my birthday party thing. But I know you didn‚Äôt go to Morningbrook with us, I
                        definitely would‚Äôve remembered.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe I had a face transplant.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe you did. But I also feel like I would‚Äôve remembered if someone in my
                        class in middle school got a face transplant.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt was the summer between eighth and ninth grade. I kept a low profile
                        afterward.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat did you look like before?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBetter,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI had a rare condition. The doctors said I was too
                        attractive. It was detrimental to my health and also society. So they gave me this face instead.
                        For the greater good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon laughs and then says, ‚ÄúI like this face.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt know what to say to that. But then voices rise up suddenly in the
                        background, all talking at once.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGIDEON!‚Äù a deep voice yells above them, followed by a chorus of giggles and
                        several female voices:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGiiiiiiideon!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome inside!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the party, right on cue,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTold you. Hey, listen, do you&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you get back to the fun.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut this is fun.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBye, Gideon.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I just barely catch the last thing he says, ‚ÄúTalk soon!‚Äù before I hang up.</p>

                    <h2>fifteen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">I wake up earlier than usual the next day and end up doing what I typically do
                        on a Sunday morning&mdash;lying in bed, scrolling through various apps on my phone. Blowing
                        through one, switching to another, then switching back to see if anything new has been posted.
                        Which, at roughly eight a.m. on a Sunday, isn‚Äôt very likely.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Though a number of pictures have gone up from the party last night. Lena Ideker
                        and Sudha Prabhu, heads tilted toward each other, looking seductively at the camera. The two of
                        them, posed similarly, but with Gideon in the center, an arm around each. The caption is three
                        chili-pepper emojis.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The girls look gorgeous&mdash;that‚Äôs nothing new. But I can‚Äôt help but focus on
                        Gideon. Gideon, pressing a kiss to Lena‚Äôs cheek. Something in my stomach shifts. Which is
                        absurd. It‚Äôs so stupid. I don‚Äôt even know why.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I close the app and get out of bed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I go over to Iris‚Äôs house that afternoon. We have a new assignment for Brit lit,
                        and since we have rehearsals after school, it makes more sense to just work on it now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I park to one side of Iris‚Äôs driveway, which is as wide as some major freeways,
                        and head to the front door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I ring the bell, and Iris answers after a long delay. I wonder for a moment how
                        you even hear the doorbell in a house as big as this. Do they have speakers throughout? Are
                        there cameras? Some kind of broadcast system?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù she says, but she turns to me right inside the door, so abruptly
                        that I have to back up fast not to run into her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMy parents don‚Äôt know about me and Paige,‚Äù she says in a low voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. ‚ÄúYou mean like‚Ä¶‚Äù I match my volume to hers. ‚ÄúYou dating, or you
                        breaking up?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAny of it. If you say one word to them&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre15">‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But Iris continues: ‚ÄúNo one will find your body.‚Äù Then she turns and goes
                        inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Awesome. Great. No problem.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I follow her upstairs to her room. She pushes the door open to reveal a huge
                        four-poster bed with ornately carved posts and a big white canopy. Windows on either side of the
                        bed look out over the sprawling lawn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I step into the room, glancing at the opposite wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù I can‚Äôt help it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The entire wall is covered, floor to ceiling, in images of the same five faces.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Iris says, crossing over to the bed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The focal point of the wall is a giant tapestry with <i class="calibre13">THIS
                            IS OUR NOW</i> emblazoned across the top, and five boys posing underneath it, grinning with
                        their arms around one another.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just ‚Ä¶ you must really ‚Ä¶ I mean, I guess you‚Äôre a big fan, huh?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou could say that,‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I barely know what to say. This room is probably three times bigger than
                        mine, this wall is expansive, and literally every inch is covered. I knew TION was popular, but
                        ‚Ä¶ well, I didn‚Äôt know they were this popular with Iris. I move closer. There are magazine
                        clippings, multiple movie posters for the TION documentary, and seemingly every promotional ad
                        and poster available&mdash;some, even, in languages I don‚Äôt recognize.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">One face is more prominent than the others. I know vaguely about the band, but
                        I could only name two of the five: Tristan, the ‚Äúbad boy,‚Äù and Kenji, the fashion plate, the
                        heartbreaker, and, clearly, Iris‚Äôs favorite. A life-sized cardboard cutout of Kenji stands in
                        the corner, his hands in his pockets, his smile wide and just a little bit roguish.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre we going to work or not?‚Äù Iris says abruptly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So we work. The boys of TION watch us unrelentingly, but we don‚Äôt speak of them
                        again until I get up to go to the bathroom. There‚Äôs an en suite attached to Iris‚Äôs
                        room&mdash;I‚Äôd have expected no less&mdash;and I jump when I flick on the lights.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Iris says from the other room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stick my head out the door. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ another Kenji in here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs <i class="calibre13">Will You Stay</i> tour Kenji,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd that one?‚Äù I point to the cutout in the corner of her room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs <i class="calibre13">All of Us</i> tour Kenji.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs a little difficult to take care of business with Kenji‚Äôs cardboard face
                        grinning at me from five feet away, but I do my best.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I say when I get back out there, because I
                        literally can‚Äôt keep from saying something. ‚ÄúYou really like Kenji.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou, like, <i class="calibre13">really</i> like Kenji.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I want to date him,‚Äù she replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut ‚Ä¶ then what else is there?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat else is there besides wanting to date someone? It‚Äôs fucking sad you have
                        to ask that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot like&mdash;obviously I know in general, I just meant, like, in ‚Ä¶ boy band
                        circumstances.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe is my small son,‚Äù Iris says, and even though the words coming from her lips
                        are completely ridiculous, her expression is 100 percent serious. ‚ÄúI want him to be happy, and
                        healthy, and to be with people he cares about, and do things that he loves. I want him to know
                        how much he‚Äôs appreciated and how much he‚Äôs changed people‚Äôs lives by ‚Ä¶ just being who he is.
                        And by helping us be who we are.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a while after that. I make an editing mark on Iris‚Äôs paper, and
                        then once again the words bubble up without my consent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt must be hard,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúYour parents ‚Ä¶ I mean, them not knowing. About Paige
                        and stuff.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh great,‚Äù Iris says, looking up from her computer. ‚ÄúIs Straighty McHetero
                        going to give me a lecture on <i class="calibre13">living my truth</i>?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI&mdash;‚Äù I blink. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm sorry. None of my business.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris frowns down at her notes, and it‚Äôs quiet for a bit. Until she says,
                        ‚ÄúSorry. I shouldn‚Äôt assume you‚Äôre straight. All I know is that you have an obvious boner for
                        Gideon Prewitt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I sputter. ‚ÄúI&mdash;I don‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThough to be fair you could have had boners for people of all genders in the
                        past and I wouldn‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Before I can respond, Iris points to the wall&mdash;the massive TION collage.
                        ‚ÄúWhich one is your favorite?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI want to know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really ‚Ä¶ familiar with them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLook at them. Your heart will tell you your favorite.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I start to smile&mdash;I think she‚Äôs joking&mdash;but when I glance over, her
                        eyes are solemn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So I get up and cross over to the wall, zeroing in on an artsy photo of the
                        boys standing on a bridge.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre15">They all stare back with thoughtful
                        expressions&mdash;Kenji‚Äôs eyebrows are pulled down, a little crease between them, like he‚Äôs
                        examining me deeply. Me, or the photographer, or whatever person he envisioned one day buying
                        this poster.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think ‚Ä¶ I think I like Kenji,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù Iris comes and stands next to me. ‚ÄúReally? You‚Äôre not just saying that
                        because you want to ingratiate yourself to me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to <i class="calibre13">ingratiate</i> myself to you, God.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat was an SAT word.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know. Do you want me to congratulate you for using it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs he really your favorite?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It might be some kind of subconscious conditioning, since his
                        face is literally all over the room, and, you know, he just watched me pee and everything.‚Äù
                        Something almost like a smile tugs at Iris‚Äôs lips. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrug. ‚ÄúHe has a certain ‚Ä¶
                        something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nods. ‚ÄúHe does.‚Äù And we both contemplate Kenji for a moment. Then she
                        crosses over to a bookshelf and grabs a book, returns, and presses it into my hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù I say, even though <i class="calibre13">Daring to Dream</i> is
                        emblazoned across the front, and underneath, <i class="calibre13">Our Words, Our Voices: The
                            This Is Our Now Official Autobiography</i>. The title says it all. In more words than are
                        probably necessary.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe first TION book,‚Äù Iris says nonetheless. ‚ÄúYou can focus on the Kenji
                        chapters if you‚Äôd like, but it really helps to understand your favorite in the context of the
                        group.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Again, I check, but again, this is not a joke. ‚ÄúUh. Thanks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nods briskly. And then ‚ÄúYou should go. I have other homework.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Zoe comes over for dinner that night, and the first thing she does when we get
                        up to my room is zero in on the TION biography, which features a black-and-white photo of the
                        TION boys on the cover, all in varying degrees of pensiveness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the deal with this?‚Äù she says, holding up the book and grinning at me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris lent it to me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay, multiple questions.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGo for it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou were hanging out with Iris?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-118" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre partners in Brit lit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBy choice?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúKind of? She sort of coerced me into it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúRedemption arc?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd is this required reading? Is that what really goes on at your school?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúObviously not,‚Äù I say with a grin. ‚ÄúIris loves them. She‚Äôs some kind of
                        superfan. She has two cardboard cutouts. She has every piece of branded merchandise they‚Äôve ever
                        released.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe considers the cover for a moment. ‚ÄúCollectible dolls?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBedsheets?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes, and apparently they come in king-sized, which boggles the mind.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBottle opener?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, Kenji‚Äôs mouth is where you put the bottle top.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFor real?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo. But if it existed, she would own it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, I guess that‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ her prerogative. Not everyone has our taste.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We start playing Battle Quest, and it‚Äôs quiet for a bit until I ask, ‚ÄúWould you
                        buy a Drunk Residential bottle opener?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo. We love them because of the music, not because we want Jes Peretta‚Äôs face
                        on stuff. Iris is obviously trying to fill some void in her life with manufactured pop music.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs crazy rich you know. Like private island rich.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe snorts. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all private island rich at your school.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Before PLSG, I didn‚Äôt know how many different kinds of rich there were. I guess
                        I thought of it more as a binary&mdash;either you had money, or you didn‚Äôt. I think Zoe, not
                        having witnessed the various gradations of Having a Boatload of Money, still probably feels like
                        that. But apparently there are many different degrees of richness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There are kids whose parents are doctors or lawyers&mdash;‚ÄúJust normal, I
                        guess,‚Äù Sam McKellar said when I asked her about it once. Though to be fair, I think Sam‚Äôs
                        perception of <i class="calibre13">normal</i> is different than my perception of <i
                            class="calibre13">normal</i>. Sam‚Äôs mom works downtown as an accountant for Chase Bank. I‚Äôm
                        pretty sure the McKellars don‚Äôt stock up on five-for-ten frozen meals as often as my family
                        does. They definitely have the luxury to think that the grocery-store brand isn‚Äôt as good as the
                        name brand. Sudha Prabhu is <i class="calibre13">normal</i> by Sam‚Äôs standards, too&mdash;both
                        her parents are cardiologists.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then there are kids whose families own something, or invented something, or are
                        the CEOs of something. ‚ÄúWell-off,‚Äù according to Sam.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre15">To me, Sam‚Äôs notion of <i class="calibre13">well-off</i>
                        was what I imagined when I thought of stereotypical rich people. They had designer things. They
                        skied. They occasionally suffered from a disregard for consequences, or the crushing weight of
                        trying to live up to their family‚Äôs expectations. Sometimes both.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">If there was a flowchart for <i class="calibre13">well-off</i>, it would start
                        with <i class="calibre13">Is there a child nicknamed ‚ÄúTrey‚Äù in your family&mdash;called thus
                            because he is the Third?</i> Yes? Well-off. No? Proceed to next question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Is there someone in your family with a name that is more
                            than the Third?</i> Callie Ford wins that at PLSG&mdash;her brother is Clifford Oscar Ford
                        the Fifth, and they call him ‚ÄúV.‚Äù Like ‚Äúfive.‚Äù Like the roman numeral for five.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Does your family own something with their last name on
                            it?</i> Like Amber Brunati. Her family owns a regional chain of fast-food Italian
                        restaurants called Brunati‚Äôs Pizza. Lena Ideker‚Äôs family owns a series of car dealerships
                        &mdash;the Ideker Automotive Group. Her dad is on TV on the regular: <i class="calibre13">Shop
                            Ideker Automotive Group for your new Ford, Volkswagen, Buick, BMW, Hyundai, Subaru, or
                            Volvo!</i> Lena had her pick for her sixteenth birthday.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then, past <i class="calibre13">normal</i>, past <i
                            class="calibre13">well-off</i>, there are kids like Iris Huang.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Where either you don‚Äôt even really know what their parents do or how they made
                        their money, or else their wealth is so conspicuous that you know exactly how because their name
                        is on a skyscraper or something. ‚ÄúNext level,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúJust ‚Ä¶ a whole other dimension of
                        rich.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The kind of rich where even rich kids think you‚Äôre rich.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can‚Äôt help but wonder how Iris‚Äôs family got so rich, so I get online that
                        night and Google a number of combinations of the name <i class="calibre13">Huang</i>, and <i
                            class="calibre13">fortune</i>, <i class="calibre13">Chicago</i>, <i
                            class="calibre13">business</i>, <i class="calibre13">rich</i>, etc.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally, I text Sam McKellar.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Hey do you know what Iris‚Äôs parents do?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She replies with a link to an article:</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">Del, Caris, and I go to the theater after school on Monday to take measurements
                        for the costumes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For the girls, we‚Äôre supposed to get measurements for the bust, waist, and
                        hips. For the guys, we need measurements for the neck, chest, sleeve, waist, hips, and&mdash;the
                        entry on the wikiHow page that gave me the most pause&mdash; inseam.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMeasure from the crotch to the back of the heel, where you want your pants to

                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Measure from the crotch</i>, it said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Thank goodness, Mr. Palmer‚Äôs plans for setting the play in the present day
                        meant that certain people&mdash;the lovers and the court for the most part&mdash;would just wear
                        clothes they already had. Or clothes we could buy, like, based off their normal sizes. So that
                        lowered the number of crotches that I would need to be around.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Not that I was pathologically afraid of crotches. I just ‚Ä¶ like to know a
                        person before I <i class="calibre13">measure from the crotch to the back of the heel where I
                            want the pants to end</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I start by measuring Keara Shelton, who‚Äôs playing Hippolyta, for the wedding
                        dress that Del‚Äôs designing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">While we‚Äôre measuring people, they‚Äôre going through the first entrance of the
                        fairies on stage. Before Titania and Oberon show up for the first time, there‚Äôs a little scene
                        between Oberon‚Äôs magical servant Puck and the character scripted as <i class="calibre13">First

                    <p class="calibre15">Puck is being played by a sophomore named Aimee Santo. I don‚Äôt know her
                        personally, but as is the way at PLSG, I‚Äôve seen her around. She has short, spiky hair and lines
                        her eyes all the way around with dark liner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It looks like most people have changed out of their school uniforms for
                        rehearsal&mdash;the girls are wearing a variety of yoga pants or soccer shorts. Aimee is wearing
                        black jeans with holes in the knees and a big, baggy T-shirt.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-120" class="calibre15">Iris is still in full uniform&mdash;jacket on,
                        even&mdash;and they make an odd picture, standing there onstage. Like Iris is Aimee‚Äôs weirdly
                        formal aunt or something.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúHow now, spirit?‚Äù</i> Aimee says. <i
                            class="calibre13">‚ÄúWhither wander you?‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris holds up her script and begins to read in a complete monotone, with little
                        pause for punctuation: <i class="calibre13">‚ÄúOver hill over dale thorough bush thorough brier
                            over park over pale thorough flood thorough fire.‚Äù</i> She speeds up even more:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúIdowandereverywhereswifterthanthemoon‚Äôssphere&mdash;‚Äù</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hold for a sec,‚Äù Mr. Palmer says. ‚ÄúIris, how about we try slowing it
                        down a little?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He works through the scene with Iris and Aimee a bit, but before long they move
                        on to Gideon‚Äôs and Paige‚Äôs entrance. We don‚Äôt get to stick around to see it, though&mdash;Del
                        gestures Caris and me out into the hallway, where we find the Mechanicals running through their
                        lines, and we set about getting their measurements.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We head back to the shop when we‚Äôre done, and as we‚Äôre wrapping up for the day,
                        Iris stops by.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She gives Del the briefest glance and then approaches me. ‚ÄúThey said to stop by
                        here for measurements?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve come tomorrow,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOr never,‚Äù Del adds. I look over to see if she‚Äôs joking, but she appears
                        absorbed in her work, pinning scraps of fabric to a dress form.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll measure you,‚Äù I say, noting the glare Iris sends Del‚Äôs way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pull out my tape and start in on it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI saw the scene you guys were doing earlier,‚Äù I say as I move Iris‚Äôs limbs
                        this way and that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUgh‚Äù is Iris‚Äôs reply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSounded like you were a little ‚Ä¶ rushed.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis whole thing is stupid,‚Äù she says darkly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou must‚Äôve done well enough in the audition to get the part.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs different.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt was fine being ridiculous when there were just two people in the room, but
                        here everyone‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ looking at me being ridiculous.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not being ridiculous, it‚Äôs acting.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, thanks. That helps.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I finish the rest of the measurements in silence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Iris says when I‚Äôm done.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-121" class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, say whatever you‚Äôre thinking.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shrug. I can‚Äôt help but think of the car ride home from rock climbing, of
                        Iris‚Äôs quiet admission: <i class="calibre13">I love her. You can‚Äôt just turn it off like
                            that.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe play is important to Paige, right?‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúLike, she‚Äôs pretty into it?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo ‚Ä¶ maybe. You could, like ‚Ä¶ take it seriously and do really well, and ‚Ä¶ show
                        her that it‚Äôs important to you, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She blinks at me. ‚ÄúWhy would I do that? Why would it matter?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shrug again and loop up my measuring tape.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what this stupid scene is about,‚Äù she says before I can move
                        away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe scene. Like the actual words.‚Äù Her voice drops. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ actually ‚Ä¶ get
                        what they‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh. Well, that‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not so complex, is it? You‚Äôre in the woods, doing your
                        fairy thing&mdash;like, running errands for Titania, I guess&mdash;when Puck shows up. And you
                        know him, you‚Äôve heard of him before, and he likes that, so he starts telling you stories about
                        funny stuff he‚Äôs done. Sort of like he‚Äôs trying to impress you, but sort of just because that‚Äôs
                        how he is. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks at me, suspicious. ‚ÄúDid you get the version where it says it all in
                        normal speak on the opposite page? Because we were supposed to get the Folger edition.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI did get the Folger.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo how do you understand what they‚Äôre saying?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I just read it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôs still eyeing me suspiciously. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she says, and then ‚ÄúHelp me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúWill. You. Help. Me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We break down Iris‚Äôs dialogue and go through it bit by bit, sitting at the bench
                        in the costume shop even after Caris and Del have left. We practice a few times, too, me
                        stumbling along as Puck in place of Aimee Santo.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When we‚Äôre finished and we‚Äôve both set our Folgers aside, I glance over at
                        Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan I ask you something?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She looks suspicious again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow did Lucas make it into TION if technically he got eliminated in week three

                        edit of this time, meaning there‚Äôs a lot of slow-motion replays and editorializing with

                        between taking measurements of the people we missed yesterday. Including Gideon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He stands in front of me expectantly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready for you to measure me!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Measure from the crotch to the back of the heel, where you
                            want your pants to end.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance across the room at Caris, who‚Äôs chatting with Aimee Santo. ‚ÄúOr, you
                        know,‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúI could just ‚Ä¶ like, you could measure yourself and read the numbers off to me,
                        if you want.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, I want the full costume shop experience.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">Okay.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I unspool the measuring tape. Then I step closer and look down at the expanse
                        of Gideon‚Äôs chest. He has one too many buttons unbuttoned on his shirt. I think. Maybe it‚Äôs
                        exactly the right number of buttons.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaudia?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I startle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAm I ‚Ä¶ supposed to do something?‚Äù Gideon says, looking at me curiously.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-123" class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, just stand there. I mean, you could put your arms
                        out. Like out to the sides.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon obeys. I go about gathering his measurements as quickly and
                        non-awkwardly as I can.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del comes in during, her arms full of fabric.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHello, Delilah,‚Äù Gideon says, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs accompanied by a sunny smile,
                        but I‚Äôm too busy fumbling with the measuring tape around his waist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAm I interrupting?‚Äù she says in that smoky voice of hers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say as Gideon says definitively:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I mark down his waist measurement and then look at the remaining empty spot on
                        the sheet, which I‚Äôd purposefully skipped.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt want to measure that. There‚Äôs no way. It‚Äôs not happening. I can feel my
                        face getting hot already.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your inseam?‚Äù I blurt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYour inseam. Like the inside of your legs, like the measurement for&mdash;‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He blinks at me. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt be properly sure unless you measure it, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the second number of your pant size,‚Äù Del says, crossing over to us. ‚ÄúPut

                        gestures widely at Gideon‚Äôs lower half&mdash;‚Äúall that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He tells me the number, and I record it, and Del moves off to the other side of
                        the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Gideon says after a moment. ‚ÄúIf I made you uncomfortable. I was just
                        trying to be funny. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNoah says I shouldn‚Äôt try to be funny but I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm the funniest
                        person I know,‚Äù he declares. ‚ÄúExcept for you. You‚Äôre funnier than me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not saying much, because you‚Äôre not funny at all,‚Äù I murmur, and then
                        blanch. That‚Äôs not the kind of joke you make around someone you don‚Äôt know very well. But Gideon
                        just grins at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe I haven‚Äôt found the right market for my humor. Maybe I‚Äôd be really big
                        overseas.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I put Gideon‚Äôs sheet on the clipboard with the others. When I look up, he‚Äôs
                        fiddling with the edges of a bolt of fabric sitting on the table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll see you around this weekend.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù Like, if he goes to the same grocery store my parents go to? Or if he
                        happens to be in the mood for a Pinky‚Äôs sub.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCool.‚Äù Gideon smiles as Aimee approaches.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, can I talk to you?‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù I turn back to my stuff. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you guys to it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI meant you,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh. Uh, yeah. Sure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you upstairs,‚Äù Gideon says to Aimee. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll see you this weekend!‚Äù
                        he says to me with a grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù I say as Aimee pulls out the stool from the table and takes a
                        seat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI heard you helped Iris with her dialogue.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI, uh. I mean, not really, we just talked about it some.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, whatever you did, you made her not suck. She said you helped her make

                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre13">PARTY 8PM TONIGHT MELISSA PRATT‚ÄôS HOUSE!!!!!!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stare at the message from Gideon in the hall between classes on Friday. It‚Äôs
                        probably a mass text, and I don‚Äôt want to be the loser who responds thinking it was just for
                        them. So I don‚Äôt reply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">IT WILL BE REALLY FUN,</i> Gideon sends a little later.
                    </p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I blink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And open up a reply:</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I smile. And against my better judgment, type:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Yeah okay.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">EXCELLENT. GET READY. SO MUCH FUN.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs not fun.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Or, really, I guess it‚Äôs more accurate to say that I‚Äôm unable to assess the
                        party‚Äôs level of fun, because I don‚Äôt make it past the front steps of Melissa Pratt‚Äôs house.
                        Gideon and Noah are standing outside when I arrive, next to Alicia and Sudha, who are sitting on
                        a decorative wrought-iron bench underneath an arched trellis.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Gideon waves when I approach. ‚ÄúHey, hey,‚Äù and he holds up a hand for a
                        high five, which I slap.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just figuring out a game plan,‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve deemed this party
                        unacceptable.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-125" class="calibre15">I blink. ‚ÄúYou said it would be unprecedented levels of
                        fun.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He shrugs. ‚ÄúUnacceptable is unacceptable.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe cups,‚Äù Gideon says resolutely.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe cups,‚Äù I repeat. I glance at the girls&mdash;Sudha is on her phone, but
                        Alicia looks exasperated. Noah is looking at Gideon expectantly, eyebrows raised, amusement
                        pulling at his lips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey have Styrofoam cups instead of plastic cups,‚Äù Gideon explains. ‚ÄúStyrofoam
                        cups are for warm drinks, but they‚Äôre serving cold drinks in them. It makes no sense. I can‚Äôt be
                        a part of that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre going somewhere else! Where should we go? What do you want to do?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt particularly want to go into Melissa Pratt‚Äôs house, but I did drive all
                        the way here. And I put on a shirt with like an actual shape to it, which goes against my
                        nonuniform, nonwork clothes policy of maximum comfort and minimal effort.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUh, I don‚Äôt know. Are there ‚Ä¶ other parties? It‚Äôs not like we can go to a
                        bar.‚Äù I figure they want to drink, but Gideon shakes his head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not trying to <i class="calibre13">party</i> party,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt
                        drink. And neither does Noah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere was an incident,‚Äù Noah says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe RumChata Incident of freshman year,‚Äù Gideon explains.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt speak of it. But we‚Äôve both sworn off alcohol forever.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, not forever,‚Äù Noah says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúForever,‚Äù</i> Gideon says emphatically. ‚ÄúWe took a vow.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe did take a vow,‚Äù Noah admits with a sheepish smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We go to Steak ‚Äôn Shake instead. Sudha opts to stay at Melissa‚Äôs, but Alicia
                        comes, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We get a booth in the corner. Noah heads off to the restroom, and for a moment,
                        it‚Äôs silent. Alicia is checking her phone. Gideon is staring at the menu. The sights and sounds
                        of Steak ‚Äôn Shake press on around us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you going to get?‚Äù Gideon says eventually, looking up at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm. They have a cookies ‚Äôn cream shake that‚Äôs really good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His face lights up. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Noah‚Äôs favorite, too!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silence again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo, uh ‚Ä¶ how long have you known him?‚Äù I ask finally, because Gideon asked me
                        a question, and so etiquette-wise, I‚Äôm probably obligated to ask one back.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre15">‚ÄúNoah?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúForever.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I raise an eyebrow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, really. Our moms have been friends since they were in school, and we grew
                        up together. Like literally, since birth. They put matching outfits on us and propped us next to
                        each other for photos before we could even sit up. So I don‚Äôt remember meeting him or becoming
                        friends with him. We just always were. You know, like one of those intrinsic facts you‚Äôve always
                        known about yourself. Like you don‚Äôt really remember learning your own name, do you? I‚Äôm Gideon
                        Prewitt, and Noah Edelman is my best friend.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI feel like that about my best friend,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúBut I remember becoming
                        friends with her. It was in preschool. So, you know. I was able to sit up on my own and stuff.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon smiles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah returns, and we order, and eventually we‚Äôre settled in with milk shakes.
                        Noah and Alicia are talking about some article they‚Äôd both read online when Gideon takes a long
                        pull from his shake and then leans forward, resting his arms on the tabletop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo I wanna know more about Battle Quest.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYour game. The game you play. Are there fairies in it? Like in <i
                            class="calibre13">Midsummer</i>? Could I be king of the fairies in the game?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo fairies. None of the races have wings in Battle Quest.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe races? Like ‚Ä¶ wizard and stuff?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThose are classes. There are races&mdash;like human, or elf, or troll. But
                        then there are classes, which is like your job or your skill. Maestro, mage, busker, archer,
                        notary‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNotary? Like a guy who stamps documents?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNotary signore. They‚Äôre a magic class. They use symbols and stuff. To be
                        honest, no one really plays it unless they absolutely have to. In order to get your cavalier
                        past thirty you have to level your notary up to fifteen.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhich means‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm ‚Ä¶ so you can have more than one class on the same character, but you have
                        to build it all the way up, like go through all the levels to gain all the skills. It‚Äôs kind of
                        like ‚Ä¶ earning degrees in different things? So you can‚Äôt become a cavalier without a notary
                        minor?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù Gideon considers this for a moment, chewing on his straw. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your
                        character like?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a thaumaturge. It‚Äôs another magic class.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her name?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúViola Constantinople. It was the first name I thought of.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe first name you thought of was Viola Constantinople?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI like the way you think,‚Äù he says with a grin. ‚ÄúDo you play any other games?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOther MMOs?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo. Just Battle Quest.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I like it. My brother and sister play it, too. And I got Zoe
                        into it.‚Äù I realize Gideon has no idea who Zoe is. ‚ÄúMy&mdash;my best friend. From Springdale. We
                        all play together sometimes&mdash;my sister‚Äôs husband joins in, and we raid, do the higher level
                        dungeons and stuff.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou have a brother and a sister?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah. Both older.‚Äù I fumble with my straw. ‚ÄúDo you have siblings?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOne sister. Victoria. She‚Äôs six years younger.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid you ever want a brother too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI already have one, remember?‚Äù he says, nodding toward Noah.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúDo you and your brother and sister and everybody all get
                        together and play? Like on a big TV or something?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, no. Everyone has to play on their own screen. At their own house, usually.
                        I mean, Zoe comes over, obviously, but my sister and brother-in-law live in Indianapolis.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre at your house, and they‚Äôre at their house‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, but we usually talk online, like Skype or whatever while we‚Äôre playing.
                        And we can all text chat in the game and see each other‚Äôs characters. We get on there and it‚Äôs
                        like‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Like we‚Äôre all hanging out. Existing in this alternate shared space.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Time passes in the game&mdash;three minutes in Aradana is equal to one hour of
                        real time. So there‚Äôs dusk. Dawn. Sunsets. Stars. There‚Äôs weather. There are rivers and lakes
                        and forests and villages and ‚Ä¶ other people, all populating this strange virtual world. It‚Äôs not
                        tangible. But somehow, when we‚Äôre there, when we play&mdash;it doesn‚Äôt feel <i
                            class="calibre13">real</i>, exactly, it doesn‚Äôt feel like real life, but it feels like what
                        it is. Something separate, and ours.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe all like different parts of it,‚Äù I say after a pause. ‚ÄúMy brother likes
                        raiding, my sister likes the side quests and stuff. And I guess I like the idea that ‚Ä¶ you know,
                        that we‚Äôre somewhere apart but still together.‚Äù I take a long drink of my shake, and when I look
                        back up, Gideon‚Äôs gaze is fixed on me. There‚Äôs something soft about his expression that I don‚Äôt
                        know what to do with, so I take another drink and then say, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also this wizard we really
                        want to fight.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo in the recent expansion&mdash;that‚Äôs like where they add new features and
                        new quests to the game&mdash;the rumor is that if you follow a series of side quests correctly,
                        you unlock a secret area in the game: the Island of Souls. On the Island of Souls is the
                        ultimate boss, the Lord of Wizard. If you battle him and win, untold riches await you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUntold riches? What does that even mean?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. No one‚Äôs actually beat him yet.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFor real?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, there are rumors online of people doing it but nothing definitive. We‚Äôve
                        been trying really hard to get there though.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do it,‚Äù Gideon says, swirling the straw around in his shake.
                        ‚ÄúCan anyone play?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI want to. Let‚Äôs go to your house and play right now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, I mean, you have to get the game and, like, design your character and
                        all that. And like I said, you have to play on your own computer, it‚Äôs not like we could all
                        play on mine or something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù He looks disappointed. But only for a moment. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see a movie then.
                        Noah, movies?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah starts to search on his phone as I look askance at Gideon. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, like,
                        ten thirty already.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo? It‚Äôs Friday.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWon‚Äôt your mom care if you‚Äôre out that late?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs at work right now,‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon‚Äôs mom is a <i class="calibre13">very</i> successful exotic dancer,‚Äù
                        Noah adds, eyes on his phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDude.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon‚Äôs mom is an ob-gyn,‚Äù Noah amends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes, she‚Äôs busy bringing new life into this world. And it conveniently
                        coincides with my little sister sleeping over at a friend‚Äôs house tonight, which means I don‚Äôt
                        have to go home, which means we should see a movie.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat about your dad? Where‚Äôs he?‚Äù I ask before I can think better of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTokyo,‚Äù Gideon replies. ‚ÄúOn business.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a <i class="calibre13">very</i> successful exotic dancer,‚Äù Noah says, and
                        I smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúPulling in some serious yen?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo many.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-129" class="calibre15">‚ÄúGuess there‚Äôs not much he can do about you pushing
                        curfew then,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúBut unfortunately, my mom is not actively pulling a human out of another
                        human, and my dad is in this time zone, so I should probably get home soon.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon grins.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>nineteen</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">When I get to the costume shop on Monday, Del holds up two oversized fake
                        flowers&mdash;one purple and one white.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFor me?‚Äù I say, and she makes a face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou want to run these upstairs? Give them to Tara Schmidt. Do you know her?
                        She‚Äôs stage manager.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I know Tara Schmidt in the same way that everyone knows everyone at PLSG. I
                        have had at least three classes with her, and I know at least two things about her&mdash;in this
                        case, that she plays the piccolo and is stage manager for this play.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I take the flowers and head upstairs. When I duck into the theater, it appears
                        they‚Äôre running through the start of act one. I find Tara sitting toward the front with Mr.
                        Palmer, a big binder open in her lap.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She lights up when she sees the flowers and whispers a quick ‚ÄúTell Del thanks!‚Äù
                        before shifting laser focus back to the proceedings onstage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I leave the theater, someone calls my name. Paige is standing at the end
                        of the hall, and she gestures me her way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGot a second?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I head toward her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI heard that you‚Äôre helping people with their lines,‚Äù Paige says when I‚Äôm
                        closer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm ‚Ä¶ not on purpose?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut you get it.‚Äù She‚Äôs got a script in one hand and she holds it up. ‚ÄúLike
                        what it‚Äôs trying to say.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSort of? I don‚Äôt know. I just read it like everyone else.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I also watched the movie adaptations I could find online. And I read some
                        articles about it. Just casual research. I did the same thing when I wanted to know more about
                        the <i class="calibre13">Titanic</i> or collected filmography of Fred Astaire. When I‚Äôm
                        interested in a thing, I want to know about that thing. Extensively.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It is a process that may or may not be happening right now with a band called
                        This Is Our Now. Hard to say. It‚Äôs still in the early stages.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe you could help me and Gideon with our first
                        scene,‚Äù Paige says, gesturing to an open classroom door a few feet away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Ask the director, he knows what he‚Äôs doing</i>, I think.
                        ‚ÄúIf you want,‚Äù I say instead, and follow her inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I watch Paige and Gideon‚Äôs first scene together&mdash;the meeting of Titania and
                        Oberon in the woods. They‚Äôve been fighting over the fate of a changeling boy; Titania was
                        friends with the boy‚Äôs mom and wants to raise him, but Oberon wants him to join his crew
                        instead. As a result of their fight, everything in the world&mdash;weather, seasons,
                        time&mdash;has gone sort of haywire.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige and Gideon have both changed out of their uniforms. Paige is wearing
                        athletic shorts and a T-shirt from some kind of charity run. Gideon is wearing jeans and a
                        patterned shirt. Neither of them look like fairy royalty. And yet, when they start the scene,
                        they each adopt a kind of ‚Ä¶ royal air about them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige is good. Very good. I don‚Äôt remember seeing her in any school plays
                        previously, but she really seems to know what she‚Äôs doing. She doesn‚Äôt trip up around the
                        language. She‚Äôs expressive and confident.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And I don‚Äôt know what I expected from Gideon, but as soon as they start, he
                        goes from goofy and dimply to ‚Ä¶ strong and commanding. He seems taller. His voice seems deeper.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They seem like ‚Ä¶ well, like the King and Queen of some kingdom. The fairy
                        kingdom, in this case.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù Paige says when they finish.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good,‚Äù I say, because it really was.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But Paige‚Äôs expression urges me on, because it seems like good is not good
                        enough for her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt just ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Really, I don‚Äôt know anything about anything, but I
                        guess I‚Äôd just say ‚Ä¶ it seems really serious right now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt is serious, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fighting.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, but ‚Ä¶ okay, don‚Äôt get me wrong, their relationship is obviously super
                        dysfunctional. But I feel like they kind of live for the drama, you know? Like they kind of love
                        it? That‚Äôs part of their dynamic. And also ‚Ä¶ it seems like there‚Äôs genuine feeling there,
                        between them. Or they would just get bored and move on, instead of always coming back for more.‚Äù
                        I make a face. ‚ÄúAt least to me. That‚Äôs how I read it, I guess.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, that makes sense,‚Äù Paige says, nodding. ‚ÄúRight?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon nods.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow would you play that in the scene?‚Äù Paige says. ‚ÄúWhat
                        would you do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an actor.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut what would you want to see?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shrug. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Like ‚Ä¶ sparks, I guess. Almost like they‚Äôre sparring.
                        But ‚Ä¶ in a hot way.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Inwardly I cringe. Sparring in a hot way. Brilliant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But Paige just grins. ‚ÄúOkay. Yeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They start the scene over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There‚Äôs a back-and-forth this time. There‚Äôs more fire to it. Gideon grins on
                        ‚Äú<i class="calibre13">Am not I thy lord?</i>‚Äù and Paige‚Äôs eyes widen, she holds a hand to her
                        heart, feigning surprise.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúThen I must be thy lady.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôs sharp from there, calling Oberon out for courting Hippolyta, describing
                        all the repercussions that their fight has had on the mortal world. But she softens, talking
                        about the mother of the changeling boy, the time they spent together before her death. It‚Äôs
                        sweet, and sad. Melancholy, even as she glances to and from the script for lines.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon‚Äôs standing tall and proud at the beginning of that last speech, but by
                        the end of it, it‚Äôs almost as if he too has softened. He steps closer to Paige, reaches for her
                        wrist, and clasps it lightly. When he speaks, his voice is almost gentle:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúHow long within this wood intend you stay?‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúPerchance till after Theseus‚Äô wedding day,‚Äù</i> she says,
                        and turns to him, eyes wide and imploring. <i class="calibre13">‚ÄúIf you will patiently dance in
                            our round and see our moonlight revels, go with us.‚Äù</i> A slight shake of her head. <i
                            class="calibre13">‚ÄúIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs good. This is good stuff.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Yes</i>, my brain says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon looks at Paige for a moment. Drifts closer, like he almost can‚Äôt help
                        it. Paige rests a hand against his chest, and for a second it looks as if they‚Äôre going to kiss.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">ALSO NO</i>, my brain replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They linger for a moment, just inches away from each other, until Gideon
                        speaks: ‚Äú<i class="calibre13">Give me that boy and I will go with thee,</i>‚Äù and suddenly it‚Äôs
                        like he flipped a switch. Paige pushes him away, all fire and brimstone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúNot for thy fairy kingdom&mdash;Fairies, away! We shall
                            chide downright if I longer stay.‚Äù</i> And she storms offstage, which, in this case, takes
                        her just a few feet to the right, before she turns and looks at me expectantly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They both do, like they weren‚Äôt just about to make out in front of me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I say, and my voice comes out a little too loud.
                        ‚ÄúYeah, like that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige beams.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">Lena Ideker hosts a party for the cast and crew on Friday night.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAll these freaking cast bonding activities,‚Äù Iris said when I mentioned it
                        after rehearsal on Wednesday. She had come to the shop to go over her scene with Puck again. ‚ÄúI
                        don‚Äôt want to bond. I specifically want to not bond. What‚Äôs the opposite of bond?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAlienate?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI want to alienate.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre pretty good at it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúHey.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I grinned.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris didn‚Äôt say if she was coming or not, so it‚Äôs a bit of a surprise to see
                        her standing in Lena‚Äôs massive kitchen, holding a soda and glaring openly at the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I consider going over to her when Gideon intercepts me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaudia! You‚Äôre here!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah. It said cast and crew, right?‚Äù <i class="calibre13">Right?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt did. And you are. Cast and crew, I mean. Or crew, specifically. Do you want
                        something to drink?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hanging out in the family room,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNoah and other people. Del‚Äôs
                        here, too! She never comes out. You should say hi.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I follow Gideon to the family room, where indeed Noah and Del and a few other
                        people&mdash;Alicia, Paige, Madison Lutz, and a couple guys who are both Mechanicals in the
                        show&mdash;have congregated, sprawling out on a giant U-shaped leather sectional. I‚Äôve never
                        seen a couch that big before, but apparently they exist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There‚Äôs a massive TV hanging on the opposite wall&mdash;more like a small movie
                        screen&mdash;and it‚Äôs currently showing the opening credits of a Pixar movie.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to pick until I got back!‚Äù Gideon
                        says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMajority rules,‚Äù Del replies. She‚Äôs holding a cup of something in one hand and
                        a TV remote in the other. She holds the drink up to me in acknowledgment when I sink down onto
                        the cushion next to her. ‚ÄúWe also decided we need popcorn and we voted you go find some,‚Äù she
                        says to Gideon, ‚Äúsince you‚Äôre the only person here who actually likes Lena.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúDelilah,‚Äù</i> Paige chides from Del‚Äôs other side, but
                        Gideon jumps up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI will not return without popcorn. Who‚Äôs with me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige looks toward Gideon, smiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go,‚Äù she says, getting up, and they
                        disappear into the other room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a moment, the opening credits ending, the movie starting, but
                        then I catch Madison leaning over to Alicia in my peripheral vision. ‚ÄúWould <i
                            class="calibre13">literally</i> not return without popcorn,‚Äù Madison says in a low voice,
                        and they both snicker as Alicia pulls out her phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del must notice me looking, because she tilts her head toward me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey started a Heartmark account,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúJustGideonPrewittThings. It‚Äôs
                        where people post all the strange things Gideon says or does.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I frown, and Madison shakes her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot in a mean way, not to make fun,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe love him, obviously. It‚Äôs
                        just ‚Ä¶ sometimes he says or does something so random it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a life-form from another
                        planet who‚Äôs failing at blending into life on earth but trying, like, <i
                            class="calibre13">really hard</i>, and you just have to share it with other people.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance at Noah, because surely he wouldn‚Äôt let people make fun of his best
                        friend in earnest, but he just nods. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true. He does at least one JustGideonPrewittThing a
                        day.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The group explodes with them, the movie temporarily forgotten.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like green M&amp;M‚Äôs even though they all taste the same.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOne time he said towels shouldn‚Äôt be too soft.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen him cry at two movies, and those movies were <i
                            class="calibre13">Spy Kids</i> and <i class="calibre13">Spy Kids 2</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del chimes in late: ‚ÄúHe prefers cereal to be soggy. I‚Äôve heard him talk about
                        it. He pours the milk in and legit lets it sit for like ten minutes before eating it. If I
                        didn‚Äôt know him, I‚Äôd be, like, what kind of serial killer shit is that&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúPun intended?‚Äù Noah says with a grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUgh, no. I mean straight-up, weaving a sweater out of your shower-drain hair,
                        serial killer nonsense. But with him, it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù She shrugs. ‚ÄúA Gideon Prewitt
                        Thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do with this information.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut aren‚Äôt you glad it‚Äôs been collected somewhere for
                        future use?‚Äù Madison says with a grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you ask me,‚Äù Del says, ‚Äúthe most valuable piece of information is to never
                        get him started on the fact that he has the same name as a Harry Potter character.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHashtag it‚Äôs spelled different, hashtag I had it first,‚Äù Madison and Alicia
                        say in unison, and then break into giggles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige and Gideon return eventually, when focus has returned to the movie, and
                        they‚Äôre each holding several bags of microwave popcorn. They hand them out and then sink down
                        onto the free section of the sofa across from Del and me, whispering to each other about
                        something.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I realize I am not very interested in watching this movie.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna grab a drink,‚Äù I say to Del, and she <i class="calibre13">hmm</i>s
                        noncommittally, more engrossed in Pixar than I expected her to be.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris is still in the kitchen when I head back through, though now she‚Äôs engaged
                        in conversation with Lena and a couple of other girls from our class.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I go to grab a soda off the island in the middle of the kitchen, but I don‚Äôt
                        really want it, and, anyway, something about Iris‚Äôs expression puts me on alert.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can hardly believe it, but the unflappable Iris Huang looks ‚Ä¶ flapped.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHonestly,‚Äù Lena is saying, and though she‚Äôs smiling, it belies the sharpness
                        in her tone. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre even here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah and I don‚Äôt get why your face is like that,‚Äù Iris replies, but it‚Äôs not
                        her best, and she seems to know that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you run along and play with your own friends?‚Äù Lena says. ‚ÄúOh. Wait.
                        I know. It‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt have any.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI have friends,‚Äù Iris says, but it lacks the usual acidity.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, Iris. You don‚Äôt. What you had were people who put up with you so they
                        could hang out with Paige.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Something flashes across Iris‚Äôs face, just for a second, and then it settles
                        into a blank expression.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But I see it. I see her grip on her drink tightening.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúName one person who likes you, and not because of Paige, and not because your
                        dad could buy them a Major League baseball team,‚Äù Lena continues. ‚ÄúName one person who
                        genuinely, actually, likes you for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It would be very easy to walk away right now. Or to stand and do nothing. But
                        it would be very hard to feel okay about that later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I swallow. And I step forward.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMe,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They both look at me. Lena blinks, clearly surprised, but then her lips curve
                        into a smile. ‚ÄúSorry, who are you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-135" class="calibre15">She is full of shit, and we all know that, because there
                        are only fifty girls a grade at PLSG, and even I could name all of them. Lena herself sat next
                        to me in chemistry sophomore year, and we were in the same reading group in world literature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris‚Äôs friend Claudia.‚Äù I grab Iris‚Äôs wrist. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù I say, and guide her
                        away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She follows, but when we reach the hallway, she shakes out of my grip roughly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt&mdash;that wasn‚Äôt necessary,‚Äù she says with a glare.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe was being a jerk.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need you to do that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI was just ‚Ä¶ trying to be nice.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt need you to feel bad for me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to lie then.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm not entirely sure whether that‚Äôs the truth. Iris just blinks at me, and I
                        continue anyway. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ‚Ä¶ friends. Kind of. Right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôs still frowning at me, but it‚Äôs a different kind of frown, a considering
                        sort of one.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ guess.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay. So. That‚Äôs that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Just because we are newly declared kind-of friends does not mean that Iris wants
                        to spend the rest of the party with me. She disappears after that and I don‚Äôt see her again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt really feel like going back to the family room (<i
                            class="calibre13">like watching Gideon and Paige all night</i>), so I go out to the backyard
                        instead. It‚Äôs quiet out there and landscaped to high hell. A pool sits in the center of the
                        yard, a big rectangle lit from within and sparkling, though it‚Äôs too cool to swim. The whole
                        pool deck is in brick, with big cushioned lounge chairs along one side. Ideker Ford must be
                        doing pretty well. That or Ideker Volkswagen, Buick, BMW, Hyundai, Subaru, or Volvo is picking
                        up the slack.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I take a seat on one of the lounge chairs and watch the water ripple until I
                        hear a door open and shut behind me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance over as Gideon sidles up to the chaise next to mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI thought you were coming back,‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shrug. ‚ÄúJust wanted a little quiet.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-136" class="calibre15">‚ÄúMind if I sit?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy would I mind?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to disturb the quiet,‚Äù he says with a crooked smile. I gesture to
                        the seat and he sits, stretching his legs out in front of him. He‚Äôs got on a pair of old-looking
                        brown leather boots that are kind of at odds with the sneaker-of-the-month culture pervasive at
                        Danforth and PLSG. ‚ÄúSmooth job answering a question with a question by the way. Super ninja
                        deflecting skills.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm a level fifty deflector,‚Äù I reply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOut of how many levels?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow many levels do you think?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDeflected!‚Äù he says, throwing his arms in the air like he‚Äôs blocking blows.
                        Then he settles back in his chair. ‚ÄúSo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you could have one superpower, what would it be?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs like the most clich√© question in the world,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs a good question!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere are literally only two responses. Either you want to fly and that means
                        you‚Äôre outgoing and free-spirited or whatever, or you want to be invisible and you‚Äôre an
                        introvert.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat if I want to do both? What if I want the power of invisible flight?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike Wonder Woman‚Äôs plane?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes, I want Wonder Woman to ride me around the sky.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I snort.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Gideon says with a grin, ‚Äútake the normal answers off the table. What
                        non-clich√© superpower would you pick?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou say yours first.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He presses farther back against the cushion of the chaise and contemplates the
                        sky for a moment. ‚ÄúI would want the power to listen to my favorite songs again for the first
                        time,‚Äù he says finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look over at him. ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs that weird?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAll the superpowers in the entire universe. Anything you could possibly dream
                        of. And all you want is to listen to your favorite songs again for the first time?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy, what would you pick?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt deflect, that‚Äôs my thing. Why? Why that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He shrugs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best feeling. The first time. Why wouldn‚Äôt you want to
                        take something you love and go back to the very best part?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe I don‚Äôt think the first part is the best part. Maybe I like the part
                        later on. Hearing a song so many times you know all the little ins and outs of it. Experiencing
                        something so many times that you can just ‚Ä¶ live in it. Maybe I like that better.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-137" class="calibre15">He looks at me for a moment and then nods. ‚ÄúOkay. Yeah. I
                        can see that.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúNow you have to pick one. But it has to be unconventional. No flying or
                        invisibility. No super spit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs super spit conventional?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know what I mean. What would you pick?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I think about it for a moment. ‚ÄúI would want the ability to see the future.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs sort of an all-encompassing power, isn‚Äôt it? You could see what
                        numbers are going to win the lottery. What stocks are going up. What choices you should make to
                        have the best life you could ever possibly have.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, sure you could make money off it, but how would that make it the best
                        life you could possibly have? Beyond money?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shrug. ‚ÄúI feel like if you can see the future, you‚Äôll never make a wrong
                        decision. Because when it comes time to decide something, you just look into the future of all
                        the possible outcomes, and pick the thing that will lead to the best one.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon considers this for a moment. ‚ÄúI would hate not having surprises,‚Äù he
                        says finally. ‚ÄúI would hate feeling like everything was predetermined.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre determining it by ‚Ä¶ looking ahead and picking the best
                        thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe the best thing‚Äôs not always the best thing. Maybe shitty things have to
                        happen to get you to the right place.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat sounds like something someone who‚Äôs never had shitty things happen to
                        them would say.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He frowns. He‚Äôs about to speak when the door bangs open behind us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGIDEON PREWITT, GETTIN‚Äô INTO IT,‚Äù someone bellows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a way better title for your mixtape,‚Äù I say as a guy I don‚Äôt know comes
                        up behind Gideon and engulfs him in a bear hug.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis dude right here,‚Äù the guy says, ‚Äúis a fucking treasure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watch Gideon stand and turn to embrace him fully. The guy thumps Gideon
                        soundly on the back, bro-style, but Gideon just hugs him in a surprisingly earnest kind of way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very drunk,‚Äù Gideon says when they pull apart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGonna drive me home later?‚Äù the guy says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The guy looks from Gideon to me and then back again, eyes widening. ‚ÄúDid I
                        interrupt?‚Äù He drops down to a loud whisper. ‚ÄúWas magic happening?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-138" class="calibre15">Gideon looks embarrassed, meeting my eyes for a second
                        and then looking away. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs embarrassed because magic was not actually happening, or
                        because I‚Äôm the person being implicated in the magic.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a moment, it‚Äôs very awkwardly silent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI, uh, think I‚Äôm gonna head back in,‚Äù I say finally, sliding off my chaise and
                        standing up. ‚ÄúGetting kind of cold out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon is very warm,‚Äù the drunk guy says too loudly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs known for. Warmth.
                        If you need someone. To warm you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon looks like he wants to melt into the ground.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSee you guys inside,‚Äù I say, and head in.</p>

                    <h2>twenty-one</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Zoe is over at our house, gaming with Alex, when I get home from the party.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre later than I thought you‚Äôd be,‚Äù she says, setting her laptop aside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWanna play?‚Äù Alex says, but Zoe stands, grabbing my arm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI want to hear about this party.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So Zoe and I get ready for bed, and I tell her about the party and about
                        Gideon. After the awkwardness of the drunk guy‚Äôs interruption, I ended up back with the
                        movie-watchers. When Gideon joined us again, minus the drunk guy, he started toward the spot
                        where Del and I were sitting, hovered awkwardly for a moment, and then moved back to the empty
                        spot beside Paige.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe sounds goofy,‚Äù Zoe says. We‚Äôre lying in bed and I‚Äôve got my teddy bear, Mr.
                        English, in the crook of one arm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe is. Kind of. But also not?‚Äù I shake my head. I think of Madison‚Äôs
                        description: <i class="calibre13">a life-form from another planet who‚Äôs failing at blending into
                            life on earth but trying, like,</i> really hard<i class="calibre13">.</i> ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like a
                        benevolent space prince. From a planet with three suns that are all named after him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, and when it rains, they call it the ‚Äòprince‚Äôs tears‚Äô in their native
                        tongue, which is so beautiful it makes you cry instantaneously.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her lips twitch. ‚ÄúIs the space prince looking for a space princess?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look up at the ceiling. ‚ÄúIf he is, he‚Äôll pick someone more suited to his
                        station in life. Like, you know, an imperial senator‚Äôs kid, or a royal from a neighboring
                        planet. Not a ‚Ä¶ humble trash robot.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey have trash robots on this planet?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey need an infrastructure for waste removal like everyone else.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre the trash robot?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say me exactly. I‚Äôm just ‚Ä¶ saying.‚Äù Magic doesn‚Äôt happen with trash
                        robots. I think that would be widely accepted on Gideon Prewitt‚Äôs hypothetical planet.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-139" class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you like him though?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúEveryone likes him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, but do you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I fumble with Mr. English‚Äôs bow tie.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe has a weird sense of humor,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI like that. And‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head. ‚ÄúAlso, his laugh is way too goofy for someone as attractive as
                        he is.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an attractive laugh? Like what would be a suitably hot laugh for him?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I try to demonstrate. Like some kind of throaty chuckle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe‚Äôs shoulders start shaking, suppressing her own laughter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat? I‚Äôm trying. Like&mdash;‚Äù I lower it a bit, try to get it deeper and
                        gruffer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She throws a pillow at me, laughing out loud now. ‚ÄúYou sound demented. Truly.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThank you. I try.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he look like?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. I could grab my phone and find any number of pictures of Gideon
                        Prewitt from any number of parties or games or school functions. But I realize that I already
                        have a picture of Gideon in my room. It‚Äôs from his fifteenth birthday party.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There was a photo booth at the arcade, and everyone was queuing up to take
                        photos with him, like he was some kind of celebrity. I got in line behind Madison and Ainsley
                        and forced my way into their photo op, because there was no way I was going to go into the booth
                        with Gideon Prewitt alone. That was just way too embarrassing. I didn‚Äôt know him at all. And he
                        was too good-looking. I was certain I‚Äôd say something stupid, because when have I ever not said
                        something stupid?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We took four pictures, and when we divided them up, I got the first one,
                        because no one else wanted it. It was the only one you could actually see me in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Madison and Ainsley and I had crammed ourselves into the booth. Madison sat on
                        Gideon‚Äôs lap, and Ainsley was squished beside him. And there was me, hunched over in the top
                        corner, mostly obscured.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Madison was grinning at Gideon, Ainsley was pulling a funny face. Gideon was
                        laughing, his mouth wide, his eyes squeezed shut. You could only see the top of my face, really,
                        the rest of it blocked by Ainsley‚Äôs head as she leaned forward. But you could tell from my eyes
                        that I was smiling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hung this picture in my locker for the remainder of freshman year. Even now
                        it‚Äôs still tucked into the bottom seam of the bulletin board hanging over my desk. It made no
                        sense, really, to keep it, because I didn‚Äôt know Gideon then, and I‚Äôve never been all that close
                        with Madison and Ainsley either.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre15">But I guess it looked how some little part of me wanted
                        things to look. Even if it was just for a second. Like some TV version of high school.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I get out of bed and grab the picture, return, and present it to Zoe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs old,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúBut it gives you a general jumping-off point.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBawww,‚Äù she says, considering it for a moment. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a cutie. Look at his
                        floppy hair.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taller now,‚Äù I say, even though a photo-booth photo in no way conveys
                        height. ‚ÄúHis hair is longer but somehow less floppy, if that makes sense.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She glances over at me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay if you like him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou just like his creepy laugh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say creepy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou said he is so hot but his laugh is so creepy. You said he laughs like a
                        deranged cartoon villain but you want to have his children.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúZoe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She cackles.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs a small, coral-colored bag with a long thin strap. I blink at it and then

                    <p class="calibre15">I take the purse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay. Geez. Thanks.‚Äù I look at it. It is definitely a hundred times nicer than

                    <p class="calibre15">She just grunts and heads off down the hall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I Google the bag that evening. It is indeed on final sale. It also retailed at
                        $498.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pick it up off my desk, carefully, like it‚Äôs live ammo. I have never owned
                        any one thing this expensive.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm still holding the bag when my mom comes in. It‚Äôs now in my lap, and I‚Äôm
                        petting it absently, like a small dog. Like it‚Äôs a sentient being.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhere did that come from?‚Äù Mom asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúA girl from school. She didn‚Äôt want it anymore.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">I don‚Äôt know if watching the TION documentary counts as doing something nice for
                        Iris, but I watch it regardless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Normally I would invite Zoe over for this kind of thing, but I think about what
                        she said when I mentioned Iris liking them&mdash;<i class="calibre13">She‚Äôs obviously trying to
                            fill some void in her life with manufactured pop music</i>. I‚Äôm not trying to fill any kind
                        of void. But ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt help it. I like TION. I like their music. It‚Äôs upbeat and happy, and even
                        when it‚Äôs not&mdash;even when it‚Äôs some kind of cheesy ballad&mdash;it works, somehow. There‚Äôs
                        an earnestness to it and also some kind of element of ‚Ä¶ fantasy, I guess. They‚Äôre creating a
                        world where you dance all night long and party till dawn and drive with the windows down and
                        kiss in the rain, and maybe it‚Äôs not realistic, but it‚Äôs appealing. Maybe it‚Äôs a little like the
                        photo-booth picture from Gideon‚Äôs birthday party&mdash;a snapshot of a different life. Some kind
                        of idealized version of how things could be.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe got into Battle Quest because of me, and I got into Drunk Residential
                        because of her, and we‚Äôve gone back and forth so many times over the years, trading interests
                        and introducing each other to new stuff. But this is one thing that I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll
                        understand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This is one thing, ironically, that I can talk to Iris about.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs remarkable&mdash;Iris could go on for hours about TION. If I just barely
                        bring them up in conversation, she‚Äôll show me videos of old interviews, behind-the-scenes posts,
                        screenshots of the boys‚Äô tweets from days or months or years ago. She has an almost alarming
                        knowledge of what any one of the TION boys are doing at any given moment&mdash;it‚Äôs easier, I
                        guess, because they‚Äôre touring right now, but she knows that Kenji and Lucas are in Los Angeles
                        while the other boys are staying in Sacramento before the show there. She follows an array of
                        TION update accounts, all the while disparaging update accounts, which <i
                            class="calibre13">shouldn‚Äôt be trusted, but still monitored nonetheless</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to start an update account for myself,‚Äù I say at school on
                        Wednesday. Brit lit has been canceled so we have a free period.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-142" class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo one would follow it,‚Äù Iris says, not looking up from
                        her homework.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJust being honest.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a bit as we both work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo ‚Ä¶ I watched the TION movie the other day,‚Äù I say eventually, eager to shift
                        to something that‚Äôs not calculus homework.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris looks up with a frown. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve told me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe could‚Äôve watched it together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ figured you‚Äôd seen it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôve seen it. I love it. I would live in that movie if I could.‚Äù A
                        pause. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ fun sharing fandom stuff with other people.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. And suddenly I recall a conversation at Amber‚Äôs Pink Party&mdash;
                        Ainsley and Madison discussing a band that had just appeared on a late-night show. <i
                            class="calibre13">Kenji looked damn good,</i> Madison had said, but Ainsley had disagreed.
                        <i class="calibre13">What was that jacket? He looked like a disco ball.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think Ainsley and Madison like TION, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris makes a face. ‚ÄúAinsley says she only likes <i class="calibre13">Will You
                            Stay</i> tour Kenji. It‚Äôs insulting.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you only like one version of your favorite, then they‚Äôre not your
                        favorite,‚Äù she says primly, and I can‚Äôt really argue with that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I go to the auditorium to give a few costume pieces to Tara during rehearsal the
                        next day, and to my surprise, Mr. Palmer spots me and gestures me over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He‚Äôs onstage, going through a couple of fixes with the couples for their big
                        scene, but he leaves them with a ‚Äútake five‚Äù and leads me off to the side.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Claudia, yes?‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. Am I going to get in trouble? For like ‚Ä¶ horning in on directorial
                        territory?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot on purpose, I just ‚Ä¶ you know, a couple people asked me about stuff
                        &mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, I think it‚Äôs fantastic,‚Äù Mr. Palmer says. ‚ÄúI love the initiative. And I
                        would absolutely love it if you have some time to maybe do a little bit of one-on-one coaching
                        with, uh, with our lovely Helena.‚Äù He gestures to where Lena is standing, chatting with the guy
                        playing Demetrius.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-143" class="calibre15">Lena, who I had an awkward confrontation with in the
                        kitchen of her own house at the last cast get-together. Lena, who pretended not to know who I

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think she would really benefit from some ‚Ä¶ close reading of the text,‚Äù Mr.

                            anything else.</i> I guess it‚Äôs for the good of the production, at least.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm ‚Ä¶ sure. Okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúExcellent. I‚Äôll have a chat with her after rehearsal today. Thank you,
                        Claudia! This‚Äôll be a big help.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúHopefully you can work miracles, because from what I‚Äôve heard, she‚Äôs been a
                        total disaster,‚Äù Del says when I mention my new assignment from Mr. Palmer. She‚Äôs working on
                        Mustardseed‚Äôs bodice, and Gideon and Noah are keeping her company, though they should both be
                        off rehearsing their monologues.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt hasn‚Äôt been that bad,‚Äù Gideon says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del snorts. ‚ÄúI heard she can‚Äôt remember her lines, so she keeps paraphrasing
                        and making shit up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTo be fair, she does have a lot of lines.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah makes a face. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been lobbying to make the <i class="calibre13">l</i>
                        in ‚ÄòHelena‚Äô capital in the program so it‚Äôs HeLena, because it would be ‚Äòso funny, like do you
                        get it? Do you get why it‚Äôs funny?‚Äô‚Äù His Lena impression is startlingly true to life.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, I guess it‚Äôs accurate,‚Äù Del says. ‚ÄúA mashup of her name and where

                    <p class="calibre15">I let out a choked burst of laughter before I can stop myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon grins but still manages to look disapproving. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs trying really hard,
                        I think.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know, her dad donated money for the production,‚Äù Del says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy, Delilah,‚Äù Noah says, fake scandalized, ‚Äúare you implying that‚Äôs why she
                        got the part?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I have my first meeting with Lena after school the next day.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt acknowledge anything that happened at her party. She just smiles
                        pleasantly at me when I walk up to her in the hall of the arts building and starts chatting
                        about rehearsals as we get situated in the same small classroom where I saw Paige and Gideon run
                        their first scene.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-144" class="calibre15">We start going through lines, beginning with her first
                        scene, where Helena runs into Lysander and Hermia as they‚Äôre making plans to run away and get
                        married.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I read her first cue: <i class="calibre13">‚ÄúGodspeed, fair Helena! Whither
                            away?‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúCall you me ‚Äòfair‚Äô?‚Äù</i> she says in sort of a broad,
                        generally enthusiastic tone. <i class="calibre13">‚ÄúThat ‚Äòfair‚Äô again unsay. Demetrius loves your
                            fair. O happy fair!‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We get through Helena‚Äôs first big speech and then stop to discuss. How it‚Äôs not
                        like Helena is just having a nice chat with Hermia&mdash;she‚Äôs upset because the guy she‚Äôs into
                        likes Hermia instead. ‚ÄúShe wants to know what Hermia‚Äôs doing to get Demetrius to like her,‚Äù I
                        explain.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lena rolls her eyes. ‚ÄúI mean, I get it, sort of. I guess I just don‚Äôt really
                        relate to her at all. She‚Äôs throwing herself at this guy who‚Äôs not into her in the slightest.
                        It‚Äôs pathetic.‚Äù She examines her nails. ‚ÄúShe should get with Theseus, at least he‚Äôs a duke.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTheseus is engaged to Hippolyta.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúEngaged is not married, that‚Äôs what my mom always says.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I have to stifle a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt is kind of messed up when you think about it,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúLysander and
                        Demetrius both get put under spells to fall in love with Helena, but Lysander‚Äôs gets taken off,
                        and Demetrius‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt. So maybe that‚Äôs actually the only reason he likes her at the end.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe deserves better, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying,‚Äù Lena says, and then picks up her
                        script. ‚ÄúBut I guess I‚Äôm stuck with her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We go through the rest of the scene, breaking down Helena‚Äôs monologue at the
                        end, and while it‚Äôs hard to get Lena to sound anything other than generally upbeat, she seems to
                        be making some sense of it at least.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMr. Palmer says we should meet again next week,‚Äù Lena says when we‚Äôre
                        gathering up our things to go. I think she‚Äôs trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúJust to brush up a few
                        more spots. But you‚Äôre probably working with other people, too, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not like I need special help.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTo be honest, this is kind of amateur stuff. I just wrapped up a <i

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">There is an annual fall carnival called Fall Fun Fest&mdash;lovingly referred to
                        as Triple F&mdash;that is an oddly big deal at Danforth and PLSG. I remember going with my dad
                        when I was a kid, but ironically I haven‚Äôt gone to one since I started high school. I had no
                        plans to change that, until Alicia catches up with me on my way to the studio after school on
                        Thursday.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo Noah invited me to Triple F,‚Äù she says without preamble, ‚Äúbut I kind of
                        said we should make it a group thing. So do you want to come and hang out with Gideon?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just ask Sudha? Or Madison?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I pause outside the door to the costume shop. I can see Del through the glass,
                        pinning fabric onto a form. ‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt know.‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">She makes <i class="calibre13">fun</i> sound more like a threat than a promise,
                        but then she tries to dial it back with a smile.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Yeah,</i> I reply. <i class="calibre13">Alicia invited
                            me.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pause and think about Iris in the kitchen at Lena‚Äôs&mdash;<i
                            class="calibre13">Name one person who genuinely, actually, likes you for you</i>. And Iris‚Äôs
                        responding silence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I type <i class="calibre13">Want to come with us?</i> and hit send before I can
                        second-guess it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Not really,</i> Iris replies a second later.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Then why did you ask me if I was
                            going?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There is a long pause. The little text bubble appears, and then disappears, and
                        then appears again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Fine. I‚Äôll go.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">So we go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alicia is standing inside the front gate when we arrive. Her nonuniform outfit
                        looks like she‚Äôs ready to be photographed and featured on a fashion blog with some pretentious
                        caption quote like <i class="calibre13">I‚Äôm just really inspired by the world around
                            me&mdash;people, places, feelings, things. Dress by Alice</i> + <i class="calibre13">Olivia,
                            shoes by Steve Madden.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alicia waves when she notices me, but her face does something strange upon
                        seeing Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI need to grab some tickets,‚Äù she says, and grips my arm. ‚ÄúCome with me,
                        Claudia,‚Äù and she pulls me in the direction of the ticket booth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy the hell would you bring Iris?‚Äù she says when we‚Äôre in the vicinity of the
                        booth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I brace myself. If Alicia is going to talk shit about Iris,
                        I‚Äôll have to say something, and it goes against my deep-seated desire to avoid Making a Scene.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy would you bring Iris on a double date? Who does that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a double date.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUh, yeah, it is.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou said it was a group thing! ‚ÄòGroup thing‚Äô does not mean ‚Äòdouble date‚Äô!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, it was implied.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou should have said the words ‚Äòdouble date‚Äô!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou should have warned me before you inflicted Iris on us!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I say, but the tone of my voice must be enough, because Alicia grimaces.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry. Okay. It‚Äôll be fine. Let‚Äôs just&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But it‚Äôs then that Noah and Gideon stroll through the gates, spot us, and wave.
                        Gideon slow-motion runs toward us, like we‚Äôre reuniting in a romantic movie. When he reaches us,
                        he hugs Alicia and then holds his hand up to me for a high five.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you ready to put the ‚Äòfun‚Äô in Fall Fun Fest?‚Äù he says as I slap his palm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI can at least put the ‚Äòtrip‚Äô in ‚ÄòTriple F.‚Äô‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúBy being clumsy, I
                        mean. Not by, like, sharing drugs with the group.‚Äù Three sets of eyes are on me, and I can‚Äôt
                        stop myself from talking. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any drugs. In case you were worried. Or, in case you
                        were ‚Ä¶ expecting me to have drugs.‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre15">Gideon grins.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then, by mercy, Iris appears at Alicia‚Äôs elbow. ‚ÄúHow long can it possibly
                        take to get tickets?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, yeah, hey,‚Äù Alicia says. I know she‚Äôs faking nonchalance, but she‚Äôs pretty
                        good at it. ‚ÄúSo we just ran into Iris, and she‚Äôs going to hang out with us. Because she doesn‚Äôt
                        have anyone else to hang out with.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris‚Äôs face darkens.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI invited her,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon looks from Iris to me to Alicia and back, his expression confused. But
                        it clears quickly, and he claps his hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI need three funnel cakes like yesterday. Claudia, can I buy you a funnel
                        cake?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like funnel cake?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI do, just, you don‚Äôt have to buy me one. But we could stand in line
                        together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He smiles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>twenty-five</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">We get funnel cake. And play those ringtoss games that are clearly rigged,
                        though I manage to win a tiny stuffed dragon&mdash;purple with electric yellow trim&mdash;that‚Äôs
                        kind of hideous. I offer it to Iris, who makes a face, and then to Alicia, who looks at me like
                        I‚Äôm crazy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it,‚Äù Gideon says, and my face must do something odd, because he
                        looks a little embarrassed. ‚ÄúYou know, if everyone else is just ‚Ä¶ willing to orphan it like
                        that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I extend the dragon toward him and he tucks it in the front pocket of his
                        jacket, so its little head is sticking out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHis name is Balthazar,‚Äù he informs me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs small right now but one day he‚Äôs going to grow as big as the Chrysler
                        Building.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll fit in your pocket in that case.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, I could grow as big as the Chrysler Building, too. My mom says I‚Äôm not
                        finished growing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre just a few thousand feet off.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere might be, like, a vat of toxic waste I could fall into sometime in the
                        future.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile as we join the others in line for the Ferris wheel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Alicia is saying as we reach them. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre perfectly safe,‚Äù Noah says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSeven people a year die in Ferris-wheel&ndash;related accidents.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes. I read it online.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a real statistic,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSeven people. A year.‚Äù Alicia‚Äôs tone brooks no argument.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so fun though,‚Äù Noah says. ‚ÄúYou can see everything from up there.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-148" class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine down here, thanks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat if it detaches and rolls away? Have you ever thought about that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI can honestly say I haven‚Äôt,‚Äù Gideon murmurs to me, and I grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The line moves forward, the couple ahead of us gets on, and then the next
                        little bench opens up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Noah wheedles, holding a hand out to Alicia as he climbs the steps.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAbsolutely not,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre holding up the line,‚Äù Iris mutters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHere, get in.‚Äù I step forward, urging Noah into the car and sliding in next to
                        him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut who‚Äôs gonna ride with me?‚Äù I hear Gideon say as the Ferris wheel attendant
                        pulls the bar down over us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We lurch to a start. I look back as the wheel slows, and see Gideon and Iris
                        getting on behind us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Next to me, Noah is quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance over at him when we‚Äôre almost to the top, the wheel still pausing to
                        load on new people. All of Triple F is laid out below us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNice view,‚Äù I say, for want of anything better.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He grunts in response.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The wind rocks us back and forth a little, the metal creaking under the seat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he says after a moment. ‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm no fun. I just ‚Ä¶ I kind of wanted
                        this to be, like, romantic. Like me and Alicia.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know, like we‚Äôd get to the top, and she could be like, ‚Äòit‚Äôs so
                        beautiful,‚Äô and I could be like, ‚Äòyes, it is,‚Äô but I‚Äôm looking at her and not the view? Or maybe
                        she‚Äôs a little scared of heights and she holds on to me or whatever?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to ruin something so clich√© for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">One corner of his mouth lifts up, a wry half-smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look out over the fair, yellow-and-white-striped tents dotting the ground
                        below us. ‚ÄúIf it makes you feel any better, you were right about her being scared. It kind of
                        backfired though, because she seems, like, pathologically afraid of this whole situation.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He huffs a laugh at that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Behind us, not too far off, a loud cackle rents the air. I glance back and to
                        my surprise it‚Äôs Iris, her head thrown back, laughing with abandon. Next to her, Gideon looks
                        slightly confused, but pleased nonetheless, at having elicited such a response.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre15">Then the wheel lurches and begins to turn again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We play a few more crappy carnival games. Noah wins a baseball hat that says <i
                            class="calibre13">I‚ÄôD RATHER BE BOWLING</i> across the front. We get another funnel cake,
                        and although Alicia insists she‚Äôs stuffed and more fried food would be absurd, she eats at least
                        half of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We make it through pretty much everything, all the way to the back edge of the
                        fair, where a little go-kart course is set up, marked off in the parking lot by stacked-up bales
                        of hay.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOoh.‚Äù Alicia grabs Noah‚Äôs arm when we near the course. ‚ÄúI love these. And
                        there‚Äôs no line!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance at Iris. ‚ÄúWant to?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù Iris replies as Alicia and Noah run ahead. ‚ÄúBut can we note that
                        Alicia‚Äôs pretty full of shit, because I feel like go-karts are probably a hundred times more
                        dangerous than Ferris wheels.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I grin, glancing over at Gideon. But his face is pulled into a frown, and
                        before I can speak, he‚Äôs moving ahead, advancing quickly on Noah and Alicia, who‚Äôve reached the
                        track and are giving their tickets to the go-kart guy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon says something to Noah that I can‚Äôt hear, and Noah replies equally
                        quietly, while Alicia puts on her helmet and picks her go-kart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Iris and I reach them, Gideon and Noah are still conferring.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú&mdash;don‚Äôt think you should.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, well, good thing it‚Äôs not up to you,‚Äù Noah says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you being serious right now?‚Äù Gideon says, and he sounds oddly ‚Ä¶ agitated.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Noah replies. He glances at Alicia, already strapped into her car, and
                        then takes the helmet out of the guy‚Äôs outstretched hand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot happening,‚Äù Gideon says, and reaches for the helmet himself, but Noah
                        pulls it back and jams it on his head, clambering into the car. ‚ÄúNot happening,‚Äù Gideon repeats
                        tightly, trying to grab the seat belt out of Noah‚Äôs hand as he goes to clasp it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLeave me alone,‚Äù Noah says, pushing Gideon‚Äôs hand away and fastening the seat
                        belt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI will sit on you,‚Äù Gideon says, and normally I would laugh, but nothing about
                        this seems funny. There‚Äôs a desperate edge to his voice. Alicia is eyeing them, confused, and
                        the go-kart guy looks annoyed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike hell you will,‚Äù Noah says. ‚ÄúGet out of the way.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-150" class="calibre15">‚ÄúKid, can you get off the course?‚Äù the go-kart guy says.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI saw your hands this morning.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI <i class="calibre13">saw</i>,‚Äù Gideon says. When Noah just stares, he turns
                        to the go-kart guy, almost frantic. ‚ÄúLook, can you just&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get a move on.‚Äù The guy claps a hand on Gideon‚Äôs shoulder and tries to
                        guide him away. Gideon just shakes him off and moves back toward Noah.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSeriously&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, seriously,‚Äù Noah says, clipped, and I‚Äôm reminded suddenly of the
                        steeliness he used on Pete Salata during rock climbing night. It‚Äôs weird to see it used on
                        Gideon. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my mom. You‚Äôre not in charge of me. At all. So back the fuck off.‚Äù And then
                        Noah pumps the gas and drives away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot fair!‚Äù Alicia cries, flooring her pedal and peeling off after him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look over at Gideon. His hands are balled into fists at his sides. On the
                        track Noah lets out a whoop and makes a sharp turn, rounding a corner and disappearing with
                        Alicia just behind him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon stands a moment longer and then stalks off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris is frowning. ‚ÄúWhat was&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúStay here, okay?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd do what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJust ‚Ä¶ make sure Noah doesn‚Äôt die.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy would Noah die?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but ‚Ä¶ stay. Okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris doesn‚Äôt scoff, for once. She just nods, eyes serious. ‚ÄúYeah, okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">With that, I turn and head after Gideon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I find him not too far away, standing off to the side of the last row of
                        concession booths. His back is to me, his head down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I think he‚Äôs mad, but when he looks back at me, there‚Äôs pure panic in his eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt&mdash;why would he&mdash;‚Äù Gideon shakes his head, breathing fast and
                        shallow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna give yourself a stomachache,‚Äù I say, which is something my mom
                        would say and entirely unhelpful in this situation. So I step closer. ‚ÄúHey, come on, come here.‚Äù
                        I don‚Äôt say ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay‚Äù because I don‚Äôt know if it is. I honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on,
                        but something is obviously wrong.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I must‚Äôve been four or five the first time I remember Julia having a panic
                        attack. We were at the mall and she was arguing with our mom about a T-shirt she wanted. My
                        little-kid memory cuts out, but suddenly we were standing by the restrooms while Julia sat on
                        the floor with her back against the wall, her face buried in her arms, while my mom kneeled next
                        to her and counted, deep breaths, five counts in, and five counts out.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-151" class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan I?‚Äù I say, reaching toward Gideon. Sometimes Julia
                        didn‚Äôt like being touched, but sometimes she said it helped, warm circles drawn on her back, or
                        gentle pressure on her temples.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nods, shuffling closer, and I put my hands on either side of his face,
                        resisting the urge to thread my fingers through his hair and instead resting them lightly atop
                        it. His skin is clammy, and there are tears forming at the corners of his eyes as he squeezes
                        them shut.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDeep breath,‚Äù I say, and repeat my mom‚Äôs often-chanted words: ‚ÄúOne two three
                        four five in, one two three four five out.‚Äù And then I demonstrate, in long, out long. Gideon
                        tries to follow. I do it again, we breathe again, and again, and finally he opens his eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He drops his head&mdash;if we were any closer, our foreheads would be
                        touching&mdash;and covers one of my hands with his own.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he says, quiet, still a little choked. ‚ÄúI freaked out. Sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll sort it out,‚Äù I say, because that‚Äôs vague enough but
                        hopefully at least a little bit comforting. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.‚Äù And I try not to think about the
                        weight of his hand on top of mine, or how soft his hair feels under my fingers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We stand like that for a bit. Until someone clears their throat behind us. I
                        turn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs Noah, standing with his hands shoved in his jacket pockets. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù
                        he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I let my hands fall from Gideon‚Äôs face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I was a dick,‚Äù Noah continues. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just ‚Ä¶ tired.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs go home,‚Äù Gideon says, his voice rough.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot that kind of tired,‚Äù he replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere you guys are!‚Äù Alicia rounds the corner, picking her way delicately
                        through the grass and holding a pretzel. She is now wearing the <i class="calibre13">I‚ÄôD RATHER
                            BE BOWLING</i> hat, and under different circumstances, I would appreciate the absurdity of
                        that. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she says, thrusting the pretzel at me. ‚ÄúIris said you wanted this. Why you
                        couldn‚Äôt get it yourself, I have no idea.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris follows quickly behind us, and her face says <i class="calibre13">Sorry, I
                            did my best</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile. ‚ÄúThank you. It was, uh, there was a carb emergency. But it‚Äôs okay
                        now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-152" class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt was three-fifty,‚Äù Alicia says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAwesome. Do you take American Express?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Next to me, Gideon gives a weak laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe we should call it a night,‚Äù Iris says. No one disagrees.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>twenty-six</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">I go to the theater to drop a few more things off with Tara on Monday afternoon.
                        They‚Äôre rehearsing the big scene with the lovers, so the court and most of the fairies are off
                        running lines, the Mechanicals are down the hall practicing their play-within-a-play, and Gideon
                        and Aimee are sitting in the house, ready to insert themselves into the scene after Mr. Palmer
                        has worked out what he refers to as all ‚Äúthe business‚Äù with Hermia, Lysander, Helena, and
                        Demetrius: who‚Äôs running where, who‚Äôs holding on to who, etc.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hand the pieces from Del over to Tara. And on my way out, I can‚Äôt help but
                        pause by where Gideon and Aimee are sitting, toward the back of the house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù Gideon says quietly, smiling at me. There‚Äôs a seat between them,
                        but he‚Äôs got his arm resting across the back of it. His fingers could brush Aimee‚Äôs shoulder if
                        either of them moved an inch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot much. I just, uh.‚Äù I glance at Aimee. I don‚Äôt want to embarrass Gideon.
                        But I keep thinking of him at Triple F, breathing fast. Near tears. ‚ÄúJust ‚Ä¶ wanted to see if you
                        were okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù he replies brightly. ‚ÄúA-okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pause, not sure if I should really ask, but I do anyway: ‚ÄúAre you and Noah
                        okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Although he‚Äôs smiling, there‚Äôs something slightly artificial about it.
                        Some kind of forced chill. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre awesome.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Aimee looks between us, amusement in her eyes. ‚ÄúWhat kind of weekend did you
                        guys have?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Gideon says, and then makes a face. ‚ÄúI mean, we had a weekend,
                        obviously, but it was fine, nothing happened.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look at him for a moment and then glance away. ‚ÄúRight, okay. Just checking.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I head off. When I reach the very back of the auditorium, I look back to where
                        Gideon is sitting. He‚Äôs got his head bent toward Aimee, whispering something. She cocks a look
                        at him and then smiles and whispers a reply. Then they both turn to face the action onstage.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúDid Gideon seem okay in rehearsal?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can‚Äôt help but ask as I drive Iris home after rehearsal that afternoon. All
                        the planets had aligned just right, meaning that I actually have the car for once.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She gives me a look. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, like, monitor him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe seemed fine,‚Äù she says begrudgingly, after a bit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We don‚Äôt talk much the rest of the ride. When we arrive at Iris‚Äôs massive
                        mansion&mdash;villa, compound, whatever&mdash;she pauses with her hand on the car door, halfway
                        out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou could&mdash;I mean, my parents are working. You could. Hang out. If you
                        want. We could watch the <i class="calibre13">Will You Stay</i> tour movie.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">It‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ fun sharing fandom stuff with other
                            people</i>. I look at her for a moment, but she‚Äôs staring intently at the dashboard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah. Okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It turns out Iris‚Äôs house has a movie screen&ndash;sized television like Lena‚Äôs,
                        though it‚Äôs not in the family room. Instead, there‚Äôs a specially dedicated ‚Äúmedia room.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris stops by her room to grab a pillow and then we head to the media room to
                        watch the concert movie of TION‚Äôs second tour, which I haven‚Äôt seen. <i class="calibre13">Will
                            You Stay: Live from S√£o Paulo.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The opening montage shows the stadium, packed to bursting with fans. Screams
                        reverberate through the media room as TION takes the stage for the show opener.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know, they‚Äôre coming here next month,‚Äù I say when we‚Äôre a couple songs in.
                        Kenji is on-screen, belting out the chorus to ‚ÄúHere and Now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI love how you think I didn‚Äôt know my favorite band in the entire world is
                        coming here next month.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt acknowledge that. ‚ÄúAre you going?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúPaige and I got tickets,‚Äù she says after a pause. ‚ÄúWe were gonna take her
                        little sister. She loves them, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-154" class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI miss her,‚Äù Iris says, and when I glance over, her eyes are glued to the TV.
                        ‚ÄúI miss hanging out with her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">On-screen, Lucas blows a kiss to the audience, and the camera cuts to a group
                        of girls jumping up and down&mdash;some screaming, some crying, all of them with their hands
                        extended toward him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much I want to tell her. I never thought about that. Like if you
                        break up with someone. So much random stuff I think of during the course of a day that I would
                        tell her if I could. But I can‚Äôt. She doesn‚Äôt want me to. She hates me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt hate you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe broke up with me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou kind of forced her to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou ‚Ä¶ prompted her. I was there, remember?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou said you couldn‚Äôt hear anything. You said you were peeing loudly.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI lied.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù she says wryly, with a shadow of a smile. It disappears after a
                        moment. ‚ÄúIf it hadn‚Äôt been then ‚Ä¶ she would‚Äôve done it eventually. I would‚Äôve driven her away at
                        some point.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm inherently unpleasant, Claudia.‚Äù I can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs joking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy for real?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt speak, and for a moment, I think that‚Äôs it. End of conversation.
                        But then she glances over at me, hugging her pillow&mdash;with a TION case, of course&mdash;to
                        her chest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you know how we met?‚Äù she says.</p>

                    <h2>twenty-seven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">According to Iris, her and Paige‚Äôs story begins on the first day of seventh
                        grade. It was Iris‚Äôs very first day at Morningbrook Academy, and she was terrified.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anybody,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúI was really shy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI find that hard to believe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause. You‚Äôre you. You just ‚Ä¶ say and do whatever. You give zero fucks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She shakes her head minutely, and her voice is quieter when she replies: ‚ÄúI
                        give a lot of fucks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige, on the other hand, has never been shy. I didn‚Äôt know her in junior high,
                        but by Iris‚Äôs account, she was fun and funny and wonderful in seventh grade, and since long
                        before that probably. She laughed easily and often. She was everyone‚Äôs friend. And on the first
                        day of seventh grade, she sat next to Iris in biology.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe just ‚Ä¶ clicked. She was my best friend. We were <i class="calibre13">best
                            friends</i>. I never got along with anybody like that before. But then everybody said ‚Ä¶
                        someone started a rumor saying that I liked her. They‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòJust look at the way Iris
                        looks at her, she‚Äôs so gone on her.‚Äô And I was. I did like her like that. But I didn‚Äôt think
                        that she ‚Ä¶ I was scared, you know? I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd ever like me back. So I would say no, I
                        would tell everyone they were wrong. And, just ‚Ä¶ over time, like‚Ä¶‚Äù She shakes her head. ‚ÄúWe just
                        kind of drifted apart. She‚Äôs the kind of person that everyone wants to be around, and I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ not.
                        By the time we got to Prospect, we didn‚Äôt really hang out much at all. She would still be nice
                        to me, you know, like wave to me in the halls and stuff, but ‚Ä¶ it was different.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But then.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It was the night of a party, sophomore year. Iris walked in on Paige making out
                        with another girl.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-155" class="calibre15">(I give a comically loud gasp here, and Iris hits me with
                        her pillow.)</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI was so surprised, I dropped my purse and they both turned and saw me, just
                        standing there like a complete idiot, but they didn‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù She cuts off, shakes her head. ‚ÄúI
                        remember it so clearly, I remember being surprised and shocked and whatever, but also like so
                        annoyed, because they didn‚Äôt break apart all the way. Paige still had her hands in the girl‚Äôs
                        hair, she still&mdash;‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúAnyway, I left as fast as I could. It was Jackie Casella‚Äôs
                        house. Have you ever been there?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the French Palladian style. Way too ostentatious if you ask me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind when I design my chateau.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris tells me how she reached the end of the driveway&mdash;it was a long
                        driveway&mdash;before she realized she had left her purse right where it landed. On the floor in
                        the hallway.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She just couldn‚Äôt fathom it. Paige was kissing a girl. Paige was <i
                            class="calibre13">kissing</i>. A <i class="calibre13">girl</i>. Paige kissed girls. That was
                        a thing Paige did. Her Paige.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut she wasn‚Äôt my Paige. We hadn‚Äôt even hung out in ages, she didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ she was
                        that other girl‚Äôs Paige. And the idea of that just ‚Ä¶ I realized I was crying. I was crying, and
                        I had to go back inside and get my purse to call someone to pick me up. But I couldn‚Äôt go back
                        inside like that. And I couldn‚Äôt go back upstairs&mdash;what if they were still there? What if
                        Paige had seen me, shrugged, and then kept on making out with that other girl because she didn‚Äôt
                        even care?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris had convinced herself that that was most certainly what was happening.
                        Paige‚Äôs hands in someone else‚Äôs hair, her smile pressed up against someone else‚Äôs lips: it was
                        terrible, it was&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut then someone said my name. I turned around and ‚Ä¶ there she was.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige, haloed in the glow of the floodlights lining the front of the house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou dropped your bag,‚Äù Paige had said, holding up Iris‚Äôs purse. She blinked
                        and then stepped closer. ‚ÄúWhy are you crying?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù Iris replied, and took the purse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI can see you. You‚Äôre crying right now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Iris said, even though it was idiotic, and then she riffled through her
                        purse for Kleenex that she didn‚Äôt have.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige clasped her hands together, biting at her bottom lip for a moment. ‚ÄúAre
                        you mad at me?‚Äù she said finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy would I be mad?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou always seem mad at me. You never talk to me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt talk to me either.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI try to. Sometimes. I just‚Ä¶‚Äù She shrugged. ‚ÄúIt got hard after a while.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-156" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause.‚Äù She took a deep breath. ‚ÄúBecause I liked you, and you were always
                        saying that you didn‚Äôt like me.‚Äù The expression on her face was pained, and it nearly broke
                        Iris‚Äôs heart all over again. ‚ÄúEvery time someone would say something about us being into each
                        other, you‚Äôd get so mad. I thought that you&mdash;I thought you would hate it if you found out
                        that they were half right.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Everything twisted and rearranged itself in Iris‚Äôs mind. Settled into something
                        she almost couldn‚Äôt believe was real. Something she had never dared to hope for.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris shook her head. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt. I ‚Ä¶ That would be very hypocritical.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Paige said, though Iris suspected she knew why.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause I like you, too. If you still ‚Ä¶ I mean, you said ‚Äòliked‚Äô like past
                        tense but it‚Äôs still, I still. Present tense. I mean I know that you‚Äù&mdash;she gestured in the
                        direction of the house&mdash;‚Äúhave someone now. That‚Äôs okay. I just ‚Ä¶ just so you know. I like
                        you, too. And I‚Äôm sorry that I ruined it. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd ever feel the same way. I thought
                        I was making it easier for both of us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige looked at her for a long moment, and maybe everything was twisting and
                        rearranging itself in her mind, too. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have someone now,‚Äù she said finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anyone.‚Äù She gestured back to the house, too. ‚ÄúWe were just
                        messing around. She doesn‚Äôt&mdash;she just likes fooling around, like at parties and stuff. So I
                        don‚Äôt have anyone. Officially.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou could have me,‚Äù Iris said. ‚ÄúOfficially.‚Äù Her heart felt ready to beat out
                        of her chest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige nodded. And then she moved toward Iris, moved close and wrapped her arms
                        around her, rested her face in the crook of Iris‚Äôs neck even though Iris was smaller. Iris
                        breathed in, breathed out. Everything smelled like Paige.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you want to be my girlfriend?‚Äù Iris whispered.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Paige pulled back a little, still so close that Iris could see the tears
                        clumping her eyelashes together. She nodded. ‚ÄúYes. Do you want to be mine?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI probably wouldn‚Äôt have asked if I didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Iris said, because she couldn‚Äôt
                        ever pass up an opportunity to be a smartass.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige just smiled, wide and radiant. It was all Iris could see.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúWe were together ever since then,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt kiss that
                        night. We wanted to do it proper, like go on a date and all that. So we went out the next day,
                        and ever since we were together. Up until Amber‚Äôs party.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWho said ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô first?‚Äù I ask, because we‚Äôre this
                        far into it anyway; why not go whole hog?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris makes a face at me. ‚ÄúNosy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHer?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tilt my head back, looking at the can lights embedded in the ceiling of the
                        media room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôve never said that to someone else,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm the cold one?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, like, in a romantic way. Obviously I‚Äôve said it to family. And Zoe.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Zoe?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMy best friend.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris considers this for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow do you know when you love a friend?‚Äù she says finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shrug. ‚ÄúHow do you know when you love your girlfriend?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou just do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSame, I guess. Or not, I don‚Äôt know. Seems more straightforward with friends,
                        don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Iris says, and when I glance over at her, her eyes are closed. ‚ÄúWell, I
                        don‚Äôt know. Paige was both, I guess.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúI think ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, I think she helped ‚Ä¶
                        balance me out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the velvet glove,‚Äù I murmur.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs that a euphemism or something? Because, I mean, we both have velvet
                        gloves.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh my God, I meant like that saying. Iron fist, velvet glove? You‚Äôre the fist,
                        she‚Äôs the glove.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúStill sounds unseemly.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGet your mind out of the gutter.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt focus. I miss her velvet glove.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGahhhh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She smiles, but it quickly fades. ‚ÄúI miss everything about her. I thought ‚Ä¶ I
                        thought maybe it would get easier. Or like, maybe it would get harder and harder every day until
                        I hit a certain point and then it would, like ‚Ä¶ recede, you know? But it hasn‚Äôt yet. Maybe it
                        never will.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt know what to say. I just give a hum of assent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks over at me, clutching the TION pillow to her chest, and her eyes
                        shine. ‚ÄúI miss her when she‚Äôs sitting three rows behind me in class. I miss her when I see her
                        talking to Sudha at lunch. I miss her in the play.‚Äù She shakes her head. ‚ÄúThat fucking play.
                        Pretending I‚Äôm a fairy and she‚Äôs the queen and I, like, serve her or whatever. Follow her. Adore
                        her.‚Äù She shakes her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not hard to pretend to love her. It‚Äôs the rest of the time,
                        having to pretend like I don‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know, I always knew that she was better than me. And I knew that her
                        friends knew, too. I knew when she told them about us, they said ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt care that you like
                        girls. But do you have to like <i class="calibre13">that</i> girl?‚Äô And I was always so scared
                        that she‚Äôd figure it out. That she‚Äôd see what everyone else saw.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris loosens her grip on the pillow and looks down at the boys‚Äô faces, fixed
                        into smiles with varying degrees of sincerity.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She thumbs at Kenji‚Äôs cheek and then presses a kiss to it absently before
                        holding the pillow tightly again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhen we broke up, and she said ‚Ä¶ she said that thing, about wanting me to be
                        better?‚Äù She glances up at me. I nod wordlessly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know she was right. I should be better. But I don‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt know
                        how to not be selfish, you know? How to not fuck things up. How to ‚Ä¶ talk to people about ‚Ä¶
                        feelings and stuff.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm serious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre literally doing it right now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks at me for a moment, face scrunched up in thought. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt
                        count,‚Äù she says finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause. I don‚Äôt know. It doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not people. You‚Äôre ‚Ä¶

                    <h2>twenty-eight</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Zoe comes over for dinner the next evening, and we sit around the table doing
                        homework after we‚Äôve cleared the dishes away. My parents have the TV on in the living room, some
                        home renovation show, and my dad is snoring lightly on the couch, my mom in her chair, working
                        on a baby hat. It‚Äôs the fourth she‚Äôs knitted for Julia‚Äôs baby so far. <i class="calibre13">My
                            first grandbaby,</i> she‚Äôs always eager to say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs it weird,‚Äù Zoe asked once, ‚Äúthat she‚Äôs going to be a grandma but she‚Äôs also
                        still your mom?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think a lot of grandmas are also still moms?‚Äù I replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know what I mean. Like she‚Äôs still actively mom-ing you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I never really thought about it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat if she loves the new grandbaby more than you?‚Äù Zoe said with a grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, she definitely will. I‚Äôve accepted that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I know that‚Äôs not the truth, but it‚Äôs funny all the same. In terms of the
                        excitement hierarchy, my mom‚Äôs anticipation of the baby nearly rivals Mark‚Äôs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe‚Äôs an only child, so her mom becoming a grandma depends solely on Zoe. When
                        we were younger, my mom preferred we hang out at our house, because Zoe‚Äôs parents work a lot and
                        she didn‚Äôt like us being at their place alone. Nowadays we do it mostly by habit, and because
                        Alex is here, too, and then we can all hang out, if Alex is in the mood.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This evening, Zoe looks up at me after a while, tapping her pencil against a
                        page of half-finished calc problems. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôd you do at Iris‚Äôs yesterday?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt think Zoe will understand about <i class="calibre13">Will You Stay</i>:
                        <i class="calibre13">Live from S√£o Paulo</i>. So I just shrug. ‚ÄúNot much. Watched a movie.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre like, actually hanging out with her now. No homework pretenses or
                        anything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúIs that weird?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWeird that you want to hang out with Iris who you hated,
                        or weird that you have a friend that‚Äôs not me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBoth, I guess? More the second one.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She clicks her mechanical pencil until the lead is long, then holds down
                        the top and presses the tip against the page, pushing the lead back in. ‚ÄúOf course not. You
                        should hang out with lots of people. You should have a lot of friends.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe have friends besides each other.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Zoe certainly does. Most of her friends were my friends, too, at one
                        point&mdash;the group of girls we hung out with in junior high. But I can‚Äôt help but think of
                        what Lena said to Iris at her party&mdash;<i class="calibre13">what you had were people who put
                            up with you so they could hang out with Paige</i>. Maybe it was a little like that? But
                        maybe that‚Äôs not fair. I‚Äôm not there with them every day the same way Zoe is.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just mean, like. Ones you make on your own,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWithout me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt point out that I did make one friend all on my own&mdash;Will Sorenson.
                        Because look how that turned out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe was the one sitting with me on the couch, running her hands through my hair
                        while I cried an embarrassing amount because I would never wear the dress I bought for Will‚Äôs
                        junior prom, and he would never kiss me again, and <i class="calibre13">I thought, I thought, I
                            just thought that he really ‚Ä¶</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet now, for a moment, until Zoe taps her pencil against her notebook
                        page once more. ‚ÄúHave you guys done differentials yet?‚Äù she says, and we talk math for a good
                        while after that.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">The texts begin appearing in rapid succession.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I call her, and she picks up on the first ring.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you okay? What‚Äôs happening right now?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNew single just dropped! A new single! From the new album! It‚Äôs the best thing
                        I‚Äôve ever heard! You have to listen to it!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay, I&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúRight now!‚Äù Iris says, and before I can say another word the opening chords of
                        what can only be the brand-new TION single are playing over the phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It has a great hook. Catchy and upbeat but with a little edge to it. A slightly
                        more grown-up sound, maybe, than the singles from their last album. Kenji‚Äôs verse is a thing of
                        beauty&mdash;he hits this falsetto on <i class="calibre13">I want to start a scandal, baby</i>
                        and then drops back down on <i class="calibre13">I do, I do, just say that you do, too,</i>
                        ripping out a giant note on the last word leading into the chorus.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When it‚Äôs done, Iris tells me it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúScandal Season‚Äù and is the first
                        single from TION‚Äôs still as of now untitled fourth album. We listen to it again, and then talk
                        about it more, and then listen again twice more for good measure, not counting all the times
                        that Iris replays Kenji‚Äôs verse. By the end we‚Äôre singing along: <i class="calibre13">I do, I
                            do, just say that you do, too.</i></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre15">Eventually, I burrow further under the covers, the phone
                        still pressed to my ear, sleepiness settling in again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris, too, sounds quieter, silences extending between comments about the song.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI wonder what Paige thinks,‚Äù she says eventually. ‚ÄúI wonder if she knows it‚Äôs
                        out.‚Äù A beat. ‚ÄúMaybe you could ask her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt call Paige at one in the morning.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúObviously I don‚Äôt mean right now, geez.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pause. ‚ÄúYou know, just because you broke up doesn‚Äôt mean you can never speak
                        to her again.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt reply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou there?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she says, and then it‚Äôs quiet again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll ask her,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSee if she thinks it‚Äôs better than ‚ÄòWithout You.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI will.‚Äù I shut my eyes. ‚ÄúI should sleep soon, I think.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan we listen one more time?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile. ‚ÄúYeah, okay.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>thirty</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Gideon‚Äôs eighteenth birthday party happens.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His house is sizable. It‚Äôs not an Iris-style mansiony-mansion, but it
                        definitely speaks to the Prewitts being <i class="calibre13">well-off</i>, at least according to
                        the Sam McKellar scale of personal wealth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon answers the door, face splitting into a smile when he sees me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here! You came!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We haven‚Äôt really hung out outside of rehearsals since Triple F. I shift back
                        and forth on the front steps. ‚ÄúI am. I did.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He opens the door wider to let me in. I imagine there isn‚Äôt going to be a table
                        for gifts, so I hand him the card I brought as I step inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan I open it now?‚Äù he says, shutting the door behind me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you want. It‚Äôs nothing special&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His eyes gleam as he opens the envelope. ‚ÄúIs it a gift card to Outback
                        Steakhouse?‚Äù And then he flips open the card, which has a cartoon dog on the front. (I
                        deliberated over it for way too long.) ‚ÄúIt is!‚Äù he says with delight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs eighteen dollars for your eighteenth birthday. I had to go there and
                        everything because they don‚Äôt normally make gift cards for eighteen dollars.‚Äù He looks up at me
                        with his lips pressed together, amusement in his eyes. ‚ÄúMost people probably would‚Äôve just
                        rounded up to twenty,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúBut, you know. I wanted to be consistent.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI love it, thank you,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMaybe you could go with me and we could share
                        a Bloomin‚Äô Onion. Throwing up in the parking lot afterward would be super optional.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can take only one more moment of the Gideon Prewitt stare. I focus on the
                        wall behind him. ‚ÄúYeah, no, you should take Noah. Relive that magical evening.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There‚Äôs a pause. When I glance back at him, his expression is unreadable. But
                        it quickly clears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, come on in. There‚Äôs food. My mom made meatballs.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-161" class="calibre15">I follow him through the foyer and into the massive
                        living room, which gives way to the massive kitchen. Noah is sitting on the couch with Paige,
                        Sudha, and Alicia. Caris and Robbie are sitting on the love seat catty-corner to them, and a few
                        guys from the play are sitting on the floor in front.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A woman stands in the kitchen, stirring a big pot. She turns when we approach.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMom, this is Claudia,‚Äù Gideon says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Her expression brightens. She lowers the flame on the stove and sets the
                        spoon down. ‚Äú<i class="calibre13">This</i> is Claudia,‚Äù she says with a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon leans against the counter. ‚ÄúMom. Please.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so nice to meet you, Claudia, I‚Äôve heard a lot about you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance at Gideon. ‚ÄúReally? Because of the Bloomin‚Äô Onion incident?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat is the Bloomin‚Äô Onion incident?‚Äù Dr. Prewitt looks between us, her smile
                        widening.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou should try the meatballs,‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really good. Prewitt
                        family specialty.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, that would be great.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Dr. Prewitt fixes a plate for me, asking about school and the play as she does,
                        and then ushers us off to join the others.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo Iris?‚Äù Gideon says as we move into the living room. I take a seat on a
                        plush armchair. It‚Äôs big enough that it could fit both of us, but he settles on the ground next
                        to it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt feeling well,‚Äù I say. That‚Äôs the official story Iris told me
                        anyway, but really I think she didn‚Äôt want to go to a party with Paige there, especially one
                        that Gideon had described to us as ‚Äúsmall, just close friends, very intimate‚Äù&mdash;he waggled
                        his eyebrows a few times and then grimaced &mdash;‚Äúwas that creepy? Sorry if that was creepy.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige looks my way from her spot on the couch. I give her a little wave, and
                        she smiles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly two girls dash in and plop down on the floor next to Gideon. They‚Äôre
                        both younger&mdash;eleven or twelve, maybe&mdash;and the one nearest to Gideon resembles him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs this your girlfriend?‚Äù she says, leaning into him but looking my way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis is my friend, Claudia, who is a girl,‚Äù he says, wrapping one arm around
                        her. ‚ÄúClaudia, this is my little sister, Victoria, and this‚Äù&mdash;he gestures to the other
                        girl&mdash;‚Äúis her best friend in the whole wide world, Casey.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúStacy!‚Äù the girl squawks. Gideon claps a hand to his forehead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes, of course. This is Tracy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon, geez,‚Äù Victoria grumbles, ducking out from under his arm. She turns to
                        me. ‚ÄúAre you in the play, too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on the costumes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh. You know, Gideon said the costumes are really good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. ‚ÄúYeah, the girl who designed them is super talented. I‚Äôm just doing the
                        sewing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She considers this for a moment and then, ‚ÄúHe said they‚Äôre sewn <i
                            class="calibre13">very well</i>.‚Äù Next to her, Gideon buries his face in his hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, Vic, how about you and Macy go get some punch, okay?‚Äù he says, muffled.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Victoria grins and gets up, pulls Stacy to her feet. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be back!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah settles in next to Gideon. ‚ÄúWas Vic trying to wingman you?‚Äù I hear him
                        say. I look down at my plate of meatballs, feeling a little flush of embarrassment like at
                        Lena‚Äôs party when the drunk guy asked whether there was ‚Äúmagic happening.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We all talk and play games and eat Prewitt family meatballs, and in general it‚Äôs
                        ‚Ä¶ nice. And absolutely nothing like Gideon‚Äôs giant birthday bash of freshman year.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I head to the bathroom partway through the evening&mdash;I got detailed
                        directions this time, and hopefully no one decides to end their relationship right outside the
                        door while I‚Äôm in there&mdash;and I pause in the hallway as I pass a cabinet with a host of
                        photos sitting atop it. The largest is a silver-framed family portrait of the Prewitts on the
                        beach, wearing white shirts and khakis, posing in the setting sun. Gideon‚Äôs dad looks a bit
                        older than his mom&mdash;he‚Äôs got gray-white hair, impeccably styled. One of his arms is slung
                        around Gideon‚Äôs shoulders, the other around Dr. Prewitt‚Äôs waist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Another frame sits next to that one, a dual set of school photos of Gideon and
                        Victoria that look pretty recent. Beside that is a small round frame with a picture of two
                        babies in it&mdash;one of those department-store portrait type things. They can‚Äôt be more than a
                        year old, sitting on the ground next to each other in front of a blue background, wearing little
                        matching white-and-blue sailor suits.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pick up the frame to get a closer look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">One baby is bigger than the other, with a round face and very little hair, and
                        his mouth is open wide in a laugh. The other baby, with dark hair and eyes, is staring solemnly
                        at the camera. Or, presumably, at whatever stuffed toy was being held up behind the camera.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs clearly baby Gideon and Noah. Best friends since forever.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I put the picture down, a small smile on my lips, and reach for the frame
                        sitting behind that one, partially obscured.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre15">This one‚Äôs a picture of Gideon alone, maybe three or four
                        at the time. He‚Äôs wearing pajamas patterned with sheriff‚Äôs stars and proudly clutching two <i
                            class="calibre13">Toy Story</i> dolls: Woody in the crook of one arm, and Buzz Lightyear in
                        the other. He‚Äôs smiling big, all chubby cheeks and gappy teeth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It makes something bloom in my chest. Some fondness, unbidden.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I startle when someone rounds the corner suddenly, and the frame slips from my
                        hand, knocks the edge of the cabinet, and falls to the floor facedown.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh gosh.‚Äù It‚Äôs Paige. ‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to startle you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I kneel down and turn the frame over. The glass has cracked.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Great. Excellent. Not only was I creeping, but there‚Äôs now evidence of my
                        creeping. There‚Äôs collateral damage as a result of me being a creepy creeper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance up at Paige. Her gaze snaps to a spot behind me just as someone else
                        enters the hallway.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDr. Prewitt,‚Äù she says, and I turn, the frame in my hands, as Gideon‚Äôs mom
                        approaches. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry.‚Äù Paige grimaces. ‚ÄúI knocked it right off the cabinet, I‚Äôm such a
                        klutz.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo big deal, hon. Let me take that. Looks like it‚Äôs mostly big pieces, but we
                        should vacuum just in case&mdash;‚Äù She goes to take the frame from me, but her eyes widen. ‚ÄúOh,
                        honey, you‚Äôve cut yourself.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look down, and it appears I have, just the tip of my pointer finger, a couple
                        of beads of blood blooming from it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She takes the frame and sets it aside. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt look too deep,‚Äù she says,
                        examining it from several angles. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a first-aid kit in the bathroom under the sink.
                        Let‚Äôs get you cleaned up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI can do it,‚Äù Paige says, stepping around the glass zone, guiding me by the
                        elbow past Dr. Prewitt and into the nearest bathroom.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She turns on the faucet and lets it run for a moment, tests the temperature;
                        meanwhile, I stand there holding my finger like a useless git. It‚Äôs starting to throb.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you do that?‚Äù I say as Paige moves my hand under the faucet, even though
                        I‚Äôm perfectly capable. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you say you broke it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou had panic eyes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know.‚Äù She looks at me, face stricken, eyes wide. Then her expression
                        softens back into an easy smile, and I‚Äôm reminded once again that she‚Äôs a pretty great actor.
                        ‚ÄúPanic eyes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just ‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt want‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For Gideon to know that I was creeping on pictures of him as an adorable kid?
                        For Gideon to know that I think he was an adorable kid? For Gideon to know that I think he‚Äôs
                        adorable now?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo problem, I got you,‚Äù Paige says with a wink,
                        switching off the faucet and grabbing a wad of toilet paper. She presses it to my finger and
                        then goes under the sink for the first-aid kit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I say weakly. I watch as she searches through the kit, and suddenly I
                        remember my one a.m. promise to Iris. ‚ÄúUm, hey, so ‚Ä¶ have you heard TION‚Äôs new single?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige looks up at me, surprised. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so good! I‚Äôve been listening to it
                        nonstop.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you, uh, think it‚Äôs better than ‚ÄòWithout You‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, definitely,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a whole new sound for them, I think it‚Äôll
                        really help them break through.‚Äù A pause as she unscrews the cap on a tube of antibiotic
                        ointment. When she speaks again, it‚Äôs a bit hesitant: ‚ÄúBut I think ‚Ä¶ I still think ‚ÄòBreathless‚Äô
                        is better.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJust ‚Ä¶ in case anyone was wondering.‚Äù She glances up at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then Gideon appears in the doorway. ‚ÄúI heard there was an injury,‚Äù he says,
                        brow wrinkled. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI might lose the finger,‚Äù I say, but he doesn‚Äôt smile, just steps into the
                        bathroom while Paige applies some Neosporin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLemme see.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMy mom‚Äôs a doctor, I should probably look.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYour mom who‚Äôs a doctor already looked and said it was fine,‚Äù Paige replies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre supposed to get a second opinion on this kind of thing,‚Äù Gideon
                        says as we all watch Paige wrap on a Band-Aid.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAll done!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I say again. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Being a nuisance. Property damage. Coming to this party in the first place. I
                        just shrug.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYour bedside manner needs work,‚Äù Gideon says as Paige starts putting the
                        first-aid kit back together.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even kiss it to make it better. That‚Äôs like an integral part of the
                        process.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGood point,‚Äù Paige says, and then claps Gideon on the shoulder. ‚ÄúAs the child
                        of a doctor, you‚Äôre probably more medically qualified for that part of the process than I am.‚Äù
                        Then she swiftly stows the kit away and slips past Gideon, throwing me another wink before she
                        heads out.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-165" class="calibre15">Leaving me. And Gideon. In the bathroom. Alone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShould I‚Ä¶?‚Äù he says after a moment, glancing at my hand, which I‚Äôm now
                        cradling to my chest for no reason at all. The pain‚Äôs settled to a dull twinge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWant to.‚Äù He shifts closer. ‚ÄúBut not if you don‚Äôt want me to,‚Äù he says,
                        quieter, and oddly serious.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I swallow. ‚ÄúIt <i class="calibre13">is</i> an ‚Ä¶ integral ‚Ä¶ part of the
                        process.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He smiles a little, takes my hand in both of his, points my finger, and raises
                        it to his face. I feel the warmth from his mouth, the press of his lips on top of the bandage.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I never think about my hand being small. I never think of any part of me being
                        small, really, but it looks small in Gideon‚Äôs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He lowers my hand but doesn‚Äôt let go. I try to say ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù but the word sticks
                        in my throat, comes out more like ‚ÄúThurnk.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He just smiles, and I realize how close we‚Äôre standing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon, Mom wants to&mdash;‚Äù Victoria sticks her head through the door. I back
                        away abruptly, bumping into the sink behind me. Gideon grabs my elbow to steady me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Victoria looks all too knowing. But she simply says, ‚ÄúCake time,‚Äù and then
                        disappears.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">The three little dots pulse for a while until a message appears, much too short

                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Good luck trying.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I meet Iris after class on Monday so we can walk over to Danforth together.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I near her locker, I see she‚Äôs there, backpack on, arms folded. But she‚Äôs
                        not alone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm already too close to turn around and disappear when I clock Paige, standing
                        a few feet away from Iris, her bag on one shoulder and an envelope in her hands.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-166" class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to ‚Ä¶ prove anything,‚Äù she‚Äôs saying as I
                        reach them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris just stares. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, then ‚Ä¶ take the tickets.‚Äù Paige extends the envelope toward her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Lexy‚Äôs birthday,‚Äù Iris says simply, arms still folded across her chest.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige looks at her for a long moment and then opens the envelope and takes one
                        ticket out, holding it to Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris just shakes her head. ‚ÄúTake your mom.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFor Lexy. She‚Äôll like that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Another long look from Paige. I might as well have been painted on the lockers
                        behind me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut you love TION,‚Äù Paige says finally, her voice soft. ‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre sold out,
                        you can‚Äôt get more&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not taking the tickets,‚Äù Iris says, turning back to her locker, grabbing a
                        book, and shutting it with a snap. ‚ÄúSo if you don‚Äôt want them, then give them away, or tear them
                        up, or whatever. But they‚Äôre yours, and I‚Äôm not taking them back.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then she walks away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I follow Iris, catching up with her on the path between the lit building and the
                        gym.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou just gave Paige your TION tickets,‚Äù I say, even though we were both there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. ‚ÄúAre you going to get new ones?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou heard her, it‚Äôs sold out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut couldn‚Äôt&mdash;I mean‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSpit it out, Claudia.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYour parents could get you tickets, right? You know ‚Ä¶ pull some strings?‚Äù With
                        a house that big, and a corporation that large, surely the Huangs had strings to pull?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris looks over at me. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt work like that. They don‚Äôt just give me
                        whatever I want whenever I want it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I think about Iris‚Äôs room, the various Kenjis and the tapestry, and the purse
                        she gave me because she didn‚Äôt like the color. I don‚Äôt have to say it out loud&mdash; it must
                        come through all too clear.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-167" class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, I know that‚Äôs how it seems. But it‚Äôs not how it
                        works. Not all the time, anyway.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo you just ‚Ä¶ gave her the tickets, even though you knew you couldn‚Äôt get new
                        ones?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI bought them for her.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúI bought them for us, to go together with
                        her little sister. And there is no us anymore. So they might as well go.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet as we cut through the Grove.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat was really nice of you. To do that,‚Äù I say finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do it to be nice.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Would it be weird to tell Iris I‚Äôm proud of her? Because I am, oddly. Proud.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy are you looking at me like that?‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo reason.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She eyes me suspiciously. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fall in love with me. Gideon would never
                        forgive me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I start to sputter a laugh, but then, ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna be late‚Äù is all Iris replies, picking up her pace.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are we doing?‚Äù my dad says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hold up my phone, the number already dialed and ready to go, seven o‚Äôclock
                        the morning after Iris gave Paige the tickets. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to win TION tickets. I can‚Äôt
                        technically win ‚Äôcause I‚Äôm not eighteen. So will you call?‚Äù</p>

                        back on and requests the twenty-seventh caller. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happening! Call now!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hand my dad the phone and hope for the best.</p>

                        winner in their mentions to try again at five. I make Alex call when he comes to pick me up from
                        rehearsal. The deejay actually answers to say we‚Äôre caller twenty and to keep trying, but that‚Äôs
                        as close as we get.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I try again on Wednesday morning with no luck. But I‚Äôm determined. I want to do
                        this for Iris. And if I‚Äôm totally, brutally honest, maybe I want it a little bit for myself,
                        too.</p>

                    <p id="calibre_link-168" class="calibre1">A few of the fairies come to the shop on Wednesday
                        afternoon to try on their costumes. Del beelines to Gideon and Aimee immediately, handing them
                        each their things.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Gideon reenters the room, he‚Äôs wearing tight jeans, tall boots like a
                        pirate, and a battered-looking dress shirt. There‚Äôs a scarf wrapped around his head, his hair
                        tumbling out from under it. He is wearing a half dozen or so necklaces of varying length and a
                        long cloak, which I know Del has spent a lot of time on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del makes him spin around and examines him for a moment. Then she steps up and
                        unbuttons two of the buttons on his shirt. Steps back, looks, then unbuttons one more so the
                        shirt falls most of the way open.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon throws his hands over his chest. ‚ÄúDelilah Legere,‚Äù he says, scandalized.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She smiles slightly. ‚ÄúBetter.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo I look hot?‚Äù he says, striding away and then back, the cloak billowing out
                        behind him. ‚ÄúI feel like I look hot.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou look good,‚Äù Del replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon‚Äôs eyes dart to me, almost in question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod and then force myself to speak. ‚ÄúNot bad.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He grins.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cut your hair,‚Äù Del says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI like it long,‚Äù Gideon replies. It looks good, undeniably&mdash;soft, curling
                        nicely under his ears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGood. You cut it, I cut you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes, Ms. Legere.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del pats his cheek and then heads off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon watches her go. ‚ÄúYou know those people where it‚Äôs like, you know they
                        could kill you, but it would be a privilege to die by their hand?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile.</p>

                        a bag of microwave popcorn I had going, and then I steer Viola Constantinople to the merchant
                        stalls to pick up some scrolls for a side quest. After I finish with the merchant, a buxom elf
                        named Trippola Lightyear approaches me, and next to her, a level-one human notary signore

                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúWhy are you a notary signore?‚Äù I ask when I see Gideon outside the arts
                        building the next day. He and Noah are hanging around out front when Iris and I arrive.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs a noble profession,‚Äù Gideon says before leaning down and pulling
                        Iris into a hug. ‚ÄúHello, First Fairy!‚Äù He‚Äôs a good bit taller, so when he straightens up, still
                        holding on, Iris‚Äôs feet dangle off the ground.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUnacceptable,‚Äù Iris says, kicking out weakly, but she clasps her arms around
                        his neck, and when he whirls them around, I can see her smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe wanted something, and I quote, ‚Äòobscure as shit,‚Äô‚Äù Noah says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou were in on this?‚Äù I say as Gideon lowers Iris back down. She punches him
                        lightly on the arm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWho do you think consulted on character design?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd you let him name his character after himself?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe has a great name, everyone says so.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I snort. ‚ÄúYou two. Honestly.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We head inside, Gideon holding the door for us. I let Noah and Iris go ahead,
                        and turn back to him as he enters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou got Battle Quest,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI did.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow come?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause you like it,‚Äù he replies, and then makes a face. ‚ÄúSo, you know, it
                        must be fun. I just ‚Ä¶ figured I‚Äôd try it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd Iris too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris was so on board.‚Äù He glances at her and Noah walking ahead of us,
                        chatting. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be the only one starting out. And she said you‚Äôve been really
                        supportive of those guys she likes? The This Is Where We Whatever?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis Is Our Now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou have a little sister and you don‚Äôt know TION?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúVic is weird, she only likes the Beatles and German techno and YouTubers who
                        do acoustic covers of dubstep songs.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúEclectic.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I part ways with them at the auditorium and head down the hall to the classroom
                        where I‚Äôm supposed to work with Lena.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôs already in there, her script in front of her, but she closes it when I
                        walk in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm off book!‚Äù she declares.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She is not off book.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre going over some of her longer speeches in Act 3. I think her delivery has
                        definitely improved, but she keeps mixing words up, dropping lines here and there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI swear I had it last night,‚Äù she keeps saying. ‚ÄúI did it so good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I prompt her for the fourth or fifth time, she drops her head into her
                        hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm never going to get this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou just ‚Ä¶ need some more time with the text,‚Äù I say, because it‚Äôs something
                        I‚Äôve heard Mr. Palmer say in rehearsal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere are just so many words, and they‚Äôre so weird, and I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶‚Äù She shakes
                        her head, frowns down at her script. Reaches for her phone, picks it up, puts it back down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHelena‚Äôs supposed to be tall, and she‚Äôs supposed to be pretty,‚Äù Lena says.
                        ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why they picked me. That‚Äôs the only reason they picked me.‚Äù She looks ‚Ä¶ oddly upset.
                        ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, like, totally oblivious. I know that‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve got going for me. God
                        doesn‚Äôt give with both hands, that‚Äôs what my mom always says.‚Äù In a small voice: ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm not
                        good at this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not true. You must‚Äôve given a good
                        audition. They must‚Äôve seen that you have ‚Ä¶ raw talent.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you think so?‚Äù she says, eyes shiny.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah. Yes.‚Äù I nod. ‚ÄúVery raw.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nods too, looking down at the script. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I
                        bet you‚Äôre right.‚Äù And when she looks up, it‚Äôs almost as if she‚Äôs seeing me for the first time.
                        ‚ÄúWould you like to come to my commercial-viewing party?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI&mdash;sorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMy commercial is premiering on TV, and we‚Äôre hosting a viewing party for
                        family and close friends. Would you like to come?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm ‚Ä¶ sure. Yes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù she says with a sunny smile. ‚ÄúLots of cast members are invited, but
                        not everyone, so don‚Äôt spread it around.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-171" class="calibre15">‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I say when it seems like I‚Äôm supposed to
                        respond.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try it again,‚Äù she says, picking up her script.</p>

                    <h2>thirty-four</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Iris, Gideon, and I go back to Aradana that night.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">After spending so much time with our guild&mdash;with Zoe and Alex and
                        everyone&mdash;it‚Äôs odd to be hanging out with different people online. To see Viola
                        Constantinople with, well ‚Ä¶ new friends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We set up a conference call online so we can talk while we play, and I lead
                        them around and help them kill the monsters in their creature logs. It‚Äôs the quickest way to
                        level up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow come we have to zap them with shit for ages and you just shoot one spell
                        and they keel over?‚Äù Iris says after our encounter with a pack of miniature wargs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm level fifty, and you‚Äôre level three.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan I just pay to be a higher level?‚Äù Iris asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the fun in that?‚Äù Gideon says, and on-screen, avatar Gideon Prewitt
                        runs into a wall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre crossing through Blaze country&mdash;a sort of outback area to the west
                        of the capital city&mdash;when we come upon the entrance to a cave that is glowing faintly. The
                        sun has just gone down in Aradana.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOoh, I read about this!‚Äù Gideon exclaims. ‚ÄúThis is an instance, right? We‚Äôre
                        about to go into one?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid you, like, read a book on gaming?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI read the Internet. It told me all about it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou read the entire Internet?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYup. I also learned a lot about Communism and sleight of hand magic.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an instance?‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, Gideon, tell us all about it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he says, and even though I can‚Äôt see his face, I somehow know he‚Äôs
                        smiling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essentially like ‚Ä¶ you know how when we‚Äôre in the market or somewhere, we can see
                        all the other players? Like Joe Schmoe elf guy walking around with his lizard friend? An
                        instance is a special area of the game&mdash;like a dungeon or something&mdash;that you go into,
                        and when you do, it sort of duplicates itself, so you‚Äôre the only ones in there. You‚Äôre all
                        alone, just you and your people. In theory, another group could enter the same dungeon, but you
                        wouldn‚Äôt see them and they wouldn‚Äôt see you, because they‚Äôre in a different instance of the same
                        place.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-172" class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFifty bucks says you have the Wikipedia page open,‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt!‚Äù Gideon squawks. ‚ÄúI happen to have studied thoroughly.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTrying to impress someone?‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe glowing cave awaits!‚Äù Gideon says abruptly. On-screen, avatar Gideon moves
                        forward, and we‚Äôre all sucked into the instance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Later on I‚Äôm waiting for Gideon and Iris to each finish a one-on-one battle
                        against a zombie captain&mdash;another instance that they each had to enter alone &mdash;and as
                        I‚Äôm standing there on the Blaze, a group comes up the hill behind me. A couple elves, a troll,
                        and a humanoid dragon carrying a large broadsword.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His name floats above his head:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alphoneus Centurion.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My stomach drops.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù Gideon mutters. ‚ÄúI keep punching this guy and he keeps zapping
                        me. Why are his zaps so powerful?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think you have to kill the little skull guys first,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre,
                        like, recharging him or something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I am barely paying attention. Inexplicably, I‚Äôm waiting for my chat window to
                        ding. For Will Sorenson to acknowledge me. But that‚Äôs absurd&mdash; he doesn‚Äôt know that this is
                        my character. He doesn‚Äôt even know that I play Battle Quest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFucking yes!‚Äù Iris lets out a whoop. ‚ÄúGot him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Trippola Lightyear materializes next to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúGod. He keeps&mdash;shit. Okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGo for his lower half, that‚Äôs where the zaps are coming from. His dick is like
                        a lightning rod.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf his dick were like a lightning rod, it would be drawing in the zaps, not
                        shooting them out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHis dick is jizzing electricity, is that better?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris Yiwei Huang, I am appalled.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow do you know my full name?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm all-knowing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-173" class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, really.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMy mom met your parents at a school thing and&mdash;fuck fuck fuck he just let
                        out this giant burst&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost finished then,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúHe did that right before he died.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then the chat window does ding. Alphoneus Centurion is addressing Trippola
                        Lightyear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Alphoneus Centurion: Greetings, traveler!</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Alphoneus Centurion: We are recruiting for our guild, the Legion of the
                        Hunt. Are you currently affiliated with a guild? Would you like to join our merry band?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaudia, what is this guy talking about? Am I supposed to say something?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAhh, got it!‚Äù Gideon says, and then avatar Gideon Prewitt reappears on-screen
                        as well.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Alphoneus Centurion: Greetings, traveler!</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He repeats the guild invite to Gideon as well.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat is this? Should we say no?‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúClaudia? You still there?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUh, yeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat should we do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I clear my throat. ‚ÄúJust ‚Ä¶ say no.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alphoneus Centurion is still standing there. Neither Iris nor Gideon respond,
                        so after a moment, he and his group move on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I say, and try to shake myself out of it. ‚ÄúYeah, I just ‚Ä¶ I know that
                        guy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat troll guy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe dragon guy.‚Äù It sounds so stupid, and I have no idea why I‚Äôm telling them.
                        ‚ÄúWe dated.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike ‚Ä¶ in the game?‚Äù Gideon says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike in real life, asshat,‚Äù Iris replies, and then a pause. ‚ÄúRight? Or have
                        you actually ‚Ä¶ dated people in this game‚Ä¶?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIn real life,‚Äù I say, though it is possible to marry someone in Battle Quest.
                        It gets you some perks, the main one being that you can teleport together. Mark‚Äôs and Julia‚Äôs
                        characters are married, and Alex has suggested it to Zoe more than once, but she always makes a
                        face: ‚ÄúI refuse to be tied down.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">(‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be more efficient though!‚Äù Alex replied. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like I can
                        freaking marry Claudia.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll marry Claudia,‚Äù Zoe said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFine. Just someone marry someone in a non-incestuous manner so that we can
                        transport places faster.‚Äù)</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I change Viola Constantinople‚Äôs cloak for the sake of having something to do.
                        ‚ÄúWe broke up.‚Äù The truth, again, unbidden: ‚ÄúHe broke up. With me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">On-screen, Trippola Lightyear begins arming a flaming arrow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna shoot him,‚Äù Iris replies simply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris! You can‚Äôt just shoot players indiscriminately!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe dumped you; he deserves to die.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIn the context of the game,‚Äù she amends. ‚ÄúHis stupid character deserves death
                        in the game.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôll make you a player killer, we won‚Äôt be able to get
                        into any of the towns, and&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt care, worth it,‚Äù Iris says as Trippola Lightyear levels her shot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf Paige had a character, you wouldn‚Äôt want me to shoot her with a flaming
                        arrow, would you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Trippola‚Äôs hand stills on her bow. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo. Maybe it‚Äôs like that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A pause. Iris and Paige obviously cared about each other. And they seem to care
                        about each other still, even now. It wasn‚Äôt a one-way street. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúArrows away,‚Äù she replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris, seriously&mdash;‚Äù But as Trippola goes to fire, Alphoneus and his group
                        disappear in the distance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHold on, there‚Äôs a spell I could do,‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúI could do ‚Ä¶ Sharp-shooter
                        and enhance your aim, or I could do Summoner and bring him back &mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou can do neither, because you‚Äôre level three,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúLook, I appreciate
                        the thought, but it‚Äôs fine, okay?‚Äù It‚Äôs quiet. ‚ÄúI should probably go, it‚Äôs getting late.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre&mdash;‚Äù Gideon starts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, okay,‚Äù Iris cuts him off. ‚ÄúSee you at rehearsal.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNight, Claude.‚Äù Avatar Gideon Prewitt vanishes, and Gideon‚Äôs name disappears
                        from the call window as well. But Iris‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWait,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTell me about the dragon guy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-175" class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon‚Äôs gone so we‚Äôre ‚Ä¶ girl talking. This is girl
                        talk.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJesus, Claudia, just tell me what happened.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to tell.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silence. I check again to see if she‚Äôs hung up. She hasn‚Äôt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I sigh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. He was my first boyfriend.‚Äù My only boyfriend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd ‚Ä¶ what? I don‚Äôt know. He liked me. And then he didn‚Äôt.‚Äù I swallow. ‚ÄúOr
                        maybe he never did, I‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I have never told another person this, not even Zoe, but for some reason,
                        inexplicably, it leaves my lips now: ‚ÄúWhen we broke up, he said he felt <i
                            class="calibre13">regular</i> with me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Except I know exactly what it meant. ‚ÄúI was ‚Ä¶ really sad about
                        it though. I thought ‚Ä¶ like, for a while after, part of me thought that maybe he would change
                        his mind. Like he would realize he made a mistake. Isn‚Äôt that stupid?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù I shake my head, even though she can‚Äôt see me. ‚ÄúBut it doesn‚Äôt seem
                        right to me that you can feel so horrible and the other person doesn‚Äôt feel&mdash;anything. I
                        hate that you can think that everything‚Äôs good, you can think they mean what they‚Äôre
                        saying&mdash;even <i class="calibre13">they</i> can think they mean what they‚Äôre
                        saying&mdash;but they don‚Äôt. And you give them whatever part of yourself and it doesn‚Äôt even
                        mean anything to them in the end. And you can‚Äôt get it back.‚Äù I swallow. ‚ÄúIt sucks. I hate it.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I take a breath. ‚ÄúSorry. Rambling.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúDo you want to play a little while longer?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, okay,‚Äù I say, and it comes out almost normal.</p>

                    <h2>thirty-five</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs Alex who finally, <i class="calibre13">finally</i> gets through at 103.5.
                        He has a brief on-air discussion with the deejay, who makes borderline offensive comments about
                        how two tickets to see TION couldn‚Äôt possibly be for him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúActually, they are,‚Äù Alex says defiantly, because that‚Äôs who he is. ‚ÄúI love
                        TION.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally now. Who‚Äôs your favorite?‚Äù the deejay says with an air of derision.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúKenji,‚Äù I whisper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúKenji,‚Äù Alex replies. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my guy. I love him. I would trust Kenji with my
                        life.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay then,‚Äù the deejay says, his line of joking effectively squashed. ‚ÄúRight
                        on, I guess.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex has to stay on the line to give his information, and he agrees to pick up
                        the tickets for me at the station when they come in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I say, for the tenth time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJust keep it in mind in case I need something in the future,‚Äù he says with a
                        grin. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking massive favor here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù I reply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Iris is oddly stoic when I tell her about the concert tickets. I didn‚Äôt expect
                        her to jump up and down, to ‚Ä¶ squeal or anything like that, but I thought she‚Äôd do more than
                        just look at me solemnly for a moment and then nod. Although she does say thank you, so I
                        consider that an achievement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I go to Iris‚Äôs house to pick her up in the afternoon, the day of the concert. A
                        housekeeper lets me in, and I climb the stairs to Iris‚Äôs room. When I stick my head through the
                        doorway, she‚Äôs standing in front of her full-length mirror, turning back and forth to admire
                        both sides of the jacket she‚Äôs wearing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-176" class="calibre15">‚ÄúKenji‚Äôs jacket from the ‚ÄòStop My Heart‚Äô video?‚Äù she says
                        without looking over. ‚ÄúYes and no.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúExplain.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the jacket but not his exact jacket. I bought one just like it. It‚Äôs
                        Valentino.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf course it is&mdash;Kenji chose it,‚Äù she says, adjusting it in the mirror,
                        then running her fingers through her hair. ‚ÄúI have something for you to wear, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúKai‚Äôs gym socks? Josh‚Äôs headgear?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHa,‚Äù Iris ducks into her closet and emerges a moment later with a long scrap
                        of purple and gold paisley fabric. ‚ÄúKenji has this scarf,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHe wore it in Japan.‚Äù She
                        gestures to me. ‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I step toward her. ‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt have to&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just borrowing it. For the night. So you don‚Äôt feel left out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wouldn‚Äôt have felt left out otherwise. I‚Äôm not sure many other girls at the
                        concert will be wearing Kenji‚Äôs Japan scarves. Or maybe they will, who knows?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLean down,‚Äù Iris says, and I do. I expect her to wind the scarf around my
                        neck, but instead she ties it around my head like a headband. A crease between her brows appears
                        as she tugs it back and forth a little, settling it, and then adjusting my hair just so.
                        ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she says, stepping back. ‚ÄúJust like Kenji.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look in the mirror. It‚Äôs not <i class="calibre13">just</i> like Kenji. But
                        coming from Iris, I think that‚Äôs an incredible compliment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I realize she‚Äôs waiting for me to say something.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI feel like ‚Ä¶ like Japan Kenji.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She grins. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the best Kenjis to feel like.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I swing back home to get my dad, since ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about you and Iris driving
                        alone downtown‚Äù was my mom‚Äôs only protest to tonight‚Äôs activities. So Dad drives us into the
                        city and lets us listen to TION the whole way. He even bops his head a few times and destroys
                        the chorus to ‚ÄúWithout You,‚Äù their first big radio hit that even people‚Äôs dads know.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He insists we go to his favorite Korean barbecue restaurant for an early
                        dinner&mdash;the kind of place where you get to cook your own food on a little grill sunken into
                        the center of the table. I‚Äôm kind of unsure what the me/my dad/Iris dynamic will be like, but
                        it‚Äôs surprisingly okay. She asks him about what it‚Äôs like to teach at PLSG. He asks her about
                        her dad‚Äôs company. They both make fun of me perpetually overcooking the meat.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-177" class="calibre15">‚ÄúBeef √† la Claudia,‚Äù Dad says with a grin. ‚ÄúCharred to
                        perfection.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">After dinner he drops us off a few blocks away from the stadium&mdash;the
                        streets are clogged with traffic&mdash;and we walk the rest of the way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We join a huge crowd when we arrive. I glance at our tickets as we slowly
                        filter into the stadium.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We go up. And up. And up, looking for our section number.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And when we finally find our section and step out into the stadium, the stage
                        could not be farther away. The boys of TION will be approximately the size of ants to us.
                        They‚Äôll be boy band&ndash;shaped specks in the distance. Even the jumbotrons look like postage
                        stamps from up here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I feel like an idiot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs not like I thought the seats would be particularly <i
                            class="calibre13">good.</i> Like obviously not on the ground level or anything. But I didn‚Äôt
                        expect them to be this terribly bad, and I‚Äôm very certain that the seats Iris originally had
                        were probably way, way better.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris just stands there, looking at the stadium below, her expression
                        unreadable. Finally she turns to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe can see everything from up here,‚Äù she says, and if the smile that breaks
                        her face isn‚Äôt genuine, it‚Äôs the best lie she‚Äôs ever delivered in the whole of our acquaintance.
                        ‚ÄúThe rainbow-light fan project is going to look so good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre right at the front of our section. So maybe if they shoot up here,
                        Kenji will see us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She just smiles at me and heads down the stairs toward our seats.</p>

                        he makes his way down the catwalk extending from the stage out into the audience. The other boys
                        are trailing somewhat behind him, Josh and Lucas pausing to wave to people here and there, Kai
                        stopping Tristan to point out a sign in the audience. Iris has her phone out, and even though
                        they‚Äôre tiny-sized from here, she takes a picture every time Kenji appears on the jumbotron.</p>

                        section joins the cheering, Iris letting out an incredible whoop. ‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt see your faces
                        up there, exactly, but I know you‚Äôre there, I know you‚Äôre beautiful, and I love you.‚Äù As the
                        rest of the boys catch up, getting into place and slipping their mics on to their stands, Kenji
                        grins, bright and devastating. Iris snaps another picture.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis is ‚ÄòScandal Season.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The show is incredible.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We jump around to the fast songs, we sway to the slow ones. During ‚ÄúIf Only,‚Äù a
                        sweet ballad, the boys sit onstage, backed only by acoustic guitar. Phone screens dot the
                        stadium like a mass of constellations, like the night sky reflected.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But it‚Äôs during an upbeat song&mdash;‚ÄúCarry Me,‚Äù one of my favorites on their
                        second album and what my mom would refer to as ‚Äúa total bop‚Äù&mdash;that I look over and see that
                        Iris is crying.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks at me, surprised almost, like she had forgotten I was there, and then
                        nods. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy,‚Äù she says, and gives a watery smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just really happy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We meet my dad after the concert is over and head back home. It‚Äôs mostly quiet
                        on the ride, but whenever Iris or I say something, we speak way too loudly. Dad doesn‚Äôt seem to
                        mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I feel tired in the best way possible.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Dad doesn‚Äôt comment when Iris directs him down the drive leading her to
                        mansion. He just pulls up to the front of the house and puts the car in park.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks for driving us, Mr. Wallace,‚Äù Iris says, unclipping her seat belt and
                        getting out of the car. ‚ÄúAnd thank you,‚Äù she says, ducking her head back in and looking at me,
                        eyes bright. ‚ÄúFor everything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo problem.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She goes to close the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I say, and she pauses. ‚ÄúYour scarf.‚Äù I go to pull it out of my hair.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou should keep it,‚Äù she replies, and then shuts the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My dad waits for Iris to get inside, ducking his head to get a better view of
                        the house. ‚ÄúThis place is something else,‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">In the hierarchy of praise from my dad, <i class="calibre13">something else</i>
                        ranks among the highest. Ironically, it can also rank lowest, depending on context. A truly
                        annoying coworker might be <i class="calibre13">something else</i>. But usually it‚Äôs something
                        wonderful, or impressive, or unique&mdash;something apart from everything else, singular and
                        rare.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNice to see you with a new friend,‚Äù Dad says as he pulls away from the house.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For some reason, I don‚Äôt protest that I had friends before. Or really, that I
                        have all the friends I need in Zoe. I just nod. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>thirty-seven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">The ‚Äúviewing party‚Äù for Lena‚Äôs commercial is held the Friday after the TION
                        concert, in a private room at Brunati Notte. It‚Äôs the upscale version of Brunati‚Äôs Pizza (which
                        offers <i class="calibre13">fast casual Italian dining, family-style pizza from our ovens to
                            your table</i>, at least according to the commercials).</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lena‚Äôs commercial for the Ideker Automotive Group is airing during an episode
                        of some network crime procedural. There‚Äôs a projector set up, ready to stream the show on the
                        wall of the dining room, and the place is near packed to bursting with Lena‚Äôs nearest and
                        dearest (and me).</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del is here, to my surprise, and of course dressed better than most everyone
                        else, in a stunning red jumpsuit. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she says when I cock an eyebrow at her. I kind of
                        thought she hated Lena. ‚ÄúHave you eaten here? The food is worth the cost of admission.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the cost of admission?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAn evening with Lena,‚Äù she whispers loudly, eyes gleaming, and then her gaze
                        shifts to somewhere over my shoulder. I turn and see Gideon and Noah waving us over from a table
                        across the room. The place isn‚Äôt huge, but a number of tables have been crammed in. A big buffet
                        is set up along one wall, and the waitstaff are currently bringing out chafing dishes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù I say after we greet Gideon and Noah and take seats at
                        their table. ‚ÄúDo we really have to watch the show?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you kidding?‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúThis is my favorite show. I‚Äôm here exclusively
                        to watch this show.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it called?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, something about murder. Or doctors. Doctors who murder? The
                        lawyers who defend them?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We get food&mdash;which really is incredible, Del is right&mdash;and when the
                        Doctors Who Murder show comes on, Lena‚Äôs father informs the room that the commercial will be
                        aired at 8:27.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">At 8:25 the room hushes, during an ad for toilet bowl cleaner.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-179" class="calibre15">And then suddenly Lena appears on-screen, wearing a
                        skintight satin minidress and posing awkwardly next to a BMW.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome to Ideker Automotive for all your car needs,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It cuts to a shot of her walking stiffly in front of a row of Volkswagens.
                        ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got everything on your must-have list. Luxury. Reliability. Affordable.‚Äù She gestures and
                        pivots. ‚ÄúIndustry standard.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance over at Gideon and find he‚Äôs looking at me. His gaze darts back to the
                        screen, but there‚Äôs a small smile on his lips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When the commercial ends, the room bursts into applause. Lena stands and hugs
                        her parents like she‚Äôs just graduated medical school. When she finally pulls away, they all look
                        a little teary-eyed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis is such a huge moment,‚Äù her mother says to the room at large. ‚ÄúAnd the
                        start of something big for our Lena.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so proud of you, Cookie,‚Äù Mr. Ideker says, pulling Lena back into a hug.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My phone vibrates in my purse. I try to check it discreetly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">You look like your eyes are screaming.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I sputter a laugh. I look up at Gideon, and he beams.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Can you blame me?</i> I reply. <i class="calibre13">What
                            was that?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">It had everything on my must-have list,</i> he says. <i
                            class="calibre13">Informational. Ingenuity. Creative.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I laugh harder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Shhh,</i> Gideon sends, <i class="calibre13">please don‚Äôt
                            distract me, my favorite show in the world is back on and I don‚Äôt want to miss it.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly my phone dings from another number. A group text to me and Gideon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Will you guys stop? It‚Äôs gross and some of us feel left
                            out.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look up and Noah catches my eye. He makes a face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAt least let me in on the joke.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon‚Äôs just being mean,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou laughed though!‚Äù Gideon replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lena makes her way to our table soon after that&mdash;she‚Äôs been doing the
                        rounds all evening. She sits down in Del‚Äôs empty chair, looking at us expectantly. ‚ÄúSo. What did
                        you think?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou were fantastic,‚Äù Gideon says, and it sounds so authentic that I wonder if
                        some part of Gideon actually believes she was fantastic.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah just nods. ‚ÄúWhat he said.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lena looks at me. ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I say, bobbing my head, and I can‚Äôt physically
                        refrain from it: ‚ÄúWatchable. Excellence.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon lets out a strangled laugh that turns into a cough.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre15">‚ÄúJesus, G,‚Äù Lena says, handing him a glass of water.
                        ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs gotten into you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He takes the glass and drinks, shakes his head, chokes out: ‚ÄúSorry. Sorry about
                        that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lena smiles, then reaches out to adjust the collar of Gideon‚Äôs shirt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat would you do without me?‚Äù she says. Then she looks across the table at
                        me. ‚ÄúYou know what, I would kill for a Shirley Temple. Claudia, do you want one?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm, sure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGreat, will you grab me one, too?‚Äù she says, and after a pause, lets out a
                        laugh, slapping her palm against the tabletop. ‚ÄúOh my God, you should see your face right now.
                        I‚Äôm kidding, oh my God, can you imagine?‚Äù She stands. ‚ÄúWe can go together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stand, too, just as Del returns to our table with another plate of food.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you want something to drink, Del?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Lena says, taking my arm in hers and leading me away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She is wearing a satin minidress that‚Äôs very similar to the one she wore in the
                        commercial, though this one is black and perilously low-cut. We go up to the bar in the dining
                        room, and she smiles at the bartender.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHi, she‚Äôll have a Shirley Temple, and I‚Äôll have a Jack and Coke, please.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The bartender smiles. ‚ÄúCan I see an ID?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lena leans in, voice smooth and silky: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just take my word for it?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He evaluates her for a moment and then nods. ‚ÄúComing right up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Is it really that easy? Are some people just living charmed lives? I don‚Äôt even
                        want a Jack and Coke, but I‚Äôm fairly certain that if I said <i class="calibre13">Can‚Äôt you just
                            take my word for it?</i> to some random bartender the answer would be a definitive no.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWon‚Äôt people wonder why your Shirley Temple isn‚Äôt pink?‚Äù I say as the
                        bartender moves about, preparing our drinks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm allowed to change my mind, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù Lena says, like it‚Äôs the simplest
                        thing in the world. Then she rests her elbows against the bar and considers me for a moment. ‚ÄúSo
                        you and Gideon seem pretty close, huh?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The abrupt change in conversation surprises me. ‚ÄúUh ‚Ä¶ yeah. I guess.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to make it awkward,‚Äù she says, leaning toward me a little just
                        like she had to the bartender. At this close range, I can see the expert precision of her
                        eyeliner, the flecks of light catching off her highlighter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve noticed.
                        You‚Äôre sort of his new thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not anyone‚Äôs thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, you know what I mean.‚Äù She waves a hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known him a long time, and
                        I know what he‚Äôs like. He gets these ‚Ä¶ <i class="calibre13">obsessions</i>, you know? Like one
                        day he wants to learn Spanish and run with the bulls and everything‚Äôs about that until the next
                        week when he wants to study abroad in Germany. He‚Äôs dying to get some shirt he‚Äôs seen on TV and
                        then he gets it, wears it once, and forgets about it. Even the whole theater thing&mdash;being
                        in the show, it was just a whim. Before theater, it was lacrosse. Before lacrosse, it was jazz
                        band. Sometimes I feel like he doesn‚Äôt know how to like something for more than ten minutes.‚Äù
                        She turns her eyes briefly to the ceiling, gives a small sigh &mdash;the picture of fond
                        exasperation. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I adore him. We all do. But that‚Äôs just how he is. He loves
                        something until he doesn‚Äôt, you know?‚Äù She gives me what she clearly thinks is a Worldly and
                        Knowing look. ‚ÄúI mean, like, he used to buy albums on vinyl for the <i
                            class="calibre13">aesthetic</i>. I‚Äôve been in his room. He doesn‚Äôt even have a record
                        player.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-181" class="calibre15">There are too many things to feel at once: an irrational
                        surge of jealousy (<i class="calibre13">why was she in his room? What were they even
                            doing?</i>); a flush of shame, because even though she‚Äôs not saying it, I feel like she‚Äôs
                        making fun of me in some way; and somehow, secondhand embarrassment for Gideon, because he
                        sounds ridiculous when she describes him like that. Just ‚Ä¶ mercurial, and oddly ‚Ä¶ foolish.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then I feel guilty for feeling embarrassed. Like I‚Äôm betraying Gideon
                        somehow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The bartender returns with our drinks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lena picks up her glass, smiling at me as she goes to take a sip. ‚ÄúBe careful
                        there. Just a word to the wise. We girls gotta look out for each other, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She takes a drink and then makes a face. ‚ÄúThis is just Coke,‚Äù she says to the
                        bartender. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no alcohol in here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, there is,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúYou just have to take my word for it.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>thirty-eight</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">I return to the private room with Lena, clutching a Shirley Temple that I don‚Äôt
                        even want. There‚Äôs a table set out now with an array of desserts on it&mdash;cannoli and cakes
                        and little tiramisus&mdash;and Noah and Gideon have joined the group lining up to get some.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I set the drink down at our table, grab my purse, and leave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My stomach is churning. <i class="calibre13">The food was too heavy,</i> is
                        what I tell myself as I fumble with my coat check ticket. <i class="calibre13">I ate too much,
                            too fast</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I riffle through my wallet for money to give the coat check guy&mdash;I‚Äôve seen
                        my parents do it, on the rare occasion we‚Äôve had a fancy dinner out; I know that you are
                        supposed to tip the coat check guy&mdash;but I can‚Äôt find money, and my hands start shaking for
                        some reason. I‚Äôm scrounging around in the bottom of my purse and the guy is just looking at me,
                        amused, until someone steps up beside me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance over. The jumpsuit, the slicked-back hair, the eyebrows that could
                        kill a man. Del.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She holds a bill in the guy‚Äôs direction, mutters ‚ÄúThanks so much,‚Äù and takes my
                        jacket from him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I put it on as I move toward the exit. I get past the hostess stand, but Del
                        stops me in the vestibule out front.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks for that,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay you back.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Del replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head, and I know my mouth is doing that thing, that barely contained
                        waver that only tells of tears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù She takes my arm, leads me to the side, by an ornate bench and a
                        ficus in a gold-rimmed pot. Then she closes me in a hug.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm embarrassed. I should fight it. But it‚Äôs too nice, too warm, too
                        comforting, so I just turn into her and hug back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù she says, but I haven‚Äôt said anything.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-182" class="calibre15">Finally she pulls back, keeps her hands on my arms,
                        looking at me like my mom would, and there‚Äôs the question that she doesn‚Äôt even have to ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLena said&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI fucking knew it,‚Äù Del says. ‚ÄúI knew she was trying to get her hooks in you.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, look.‚Äù I shake my head. She already has murder in her eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not
                        &mdash;she just&mdash;it‚Äôs not because of what she said, I‚Äôm not ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can‚Äôt answer, though, because I see Gideon spot us from inside the dining
                        room, and then he‚Äôs headed our way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, dessert‚Äôs out,‚Äù he says when he reaches us. ‚ÄúI was ‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I say, but that‚Äôs not good enough for him, I know that. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt
                        feel well. I think ‚Ä¶ maybe the food, or maybe I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ just tired, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm gonna go.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He frowns. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drive you home.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll drive your car, and someone can come pick me up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, just ‚Ä¶ stay here and have fun.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI won‚Äôt have fun if I‚Äôm worrying about you. Let me take you home.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to,‚Äù I say, and it comes out sharp.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDude,‚Äù Del says, looking at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon just blinks once, twice, a wrinkle appearing between his brows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to,‚Äù I say again, quieter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù And I go.

                    <h2>thirty-nine</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Zoe is there when I get home, gaming with Alex.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou have to tell me literally everything,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou promised.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head. ‚ÄúTomorrow. I feel gross now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWas it the food, or was the commercial really that bad?‚Äù she says with a wry
                        smile, but I just wrap an arm around my stomach.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was mean to Gideon for no reason. I was mean and even still, he texted me a
                        few minutes ago&mdash;<i class="calibre13">Did you get home ok?</i>&mdash;and I haven‚Äôt
                        responded.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just play,‚Äù I say, and we meet up in Aradana, but not before I bite the
                        bullet and text back a <i class="calibre13">yeah</i>. Gideon doesn‚Äôt reply after that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Julia and Mark are online, too, so we clear some dungeons until we start making
                        careless mistakes, Zoe probably because she‚Äôs tired, and me because my mind is too full of other
                        things.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So we go to bed, and after Zoe mumbles <i class="calibre13">g‚Äônight</i> I think
                        that there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll ever get to sleep, but somehow I drop off right away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I wake up a couple hours later and stumble out of bed to hit the bathroom,
                        I realize that Zoe‚Äôs not there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stick my head out into the hall, but the bathroom door is open, the light
                        off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I step out, and I realize that the door to Alex‚Äôs room is cracked just a bit. I
                        can hear sounds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Smacking sounds. A wet pop. A small ‚Ä¶ sigh ‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Ew</i> is my very first thought. Jesus. I don‚Äôt need to
                        hear Alex ‚Ä¶ doing whatever Alex does.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But then.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Two sighs. Two voices.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It doesn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ compute. Yet at the same time, all at once I know exactly what‚Äôs
                        going on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I rewind through it in my mind at hyper speed&mdash;<i class="calibre13">Tell
                            Zoe she should come over</i> and <i class="calibre13">Is your brother around?</i> All those
                        times coming home and she‚Äôs already here, but Zoe being here has never been unusual. She‚Äôs like
                        the School Days portraits on the kitchen wall, the curtains in the living room my mom sewed when
                        we were little, a feature of our house, something that belongs. Zoe has always belonged&mdash;<i
                            class="calibre13">one of those intrinsic facts you know about yourself&mdash;</i>and when I
                        come home and Zoe‚Äôs already here, it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs waiting for me. I thought she was waiting
                        for me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre15">I stand there for a moment, paralyzed, before crossing
                        the hallway back to my room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When Zoe slips back in an hour or so later, I am still awake.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She pauses when she sees me, her hand on the doorknob as she‚Äôs shutting the
                        door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up,‚Äù she says, voice scratchy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt sleep. I was just‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat? You were just what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She knows I know. I know she knows I know. But neither of us speaks for a long
                        moment, and it‚Äôs hard not to feel stupidly melodramatic, like somehow something hangs in the
                        balance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say?‚Äù she says finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Just tell me</i>. ‚ÄúSay what you were doing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She crosses her arms, leans back against the door, directs her gaze at the
                        ground. ‚ÄúClaude‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve told me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ know how you‚Äôd react. And at first I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was&mdash;
                        like if we were just messing around, or if‚Ä¶‚Äù She shrugs. ‚ÄúOr if it was, you know. For real.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she says, even though the question was perfectly clear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSince the summer. Since we got out of school for the summer.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHoly shit, Zoe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say,‚Äù she says again, which is not the thing I want her
                        to say, which is <i class="calibre13">sorry, I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm so so sorry.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat must‚Äôve been really funny.‚Äù I can‚Äôt help how bitter it sounds. ‚Äú‚ÄòOh gee,
                        Claudia has no idea, what an idiot, she‚Äôs so oblivious&mdash;‚Äô‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaude&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI see you almost every day,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúWe text each other what we fucking had
                        for lunch, but you left out the part where you and Alex are ‚Ä¶ doing whatever?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause I thought you might freak out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-184" class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo were you going to tell me after you guys broke up, or
                        at your engagement party?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGod, this isn‚Äôt&mdash;you‚Äôre overreacting.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI am UNDERREACTING, ZOE.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She tries to shush me, holding her hands up and looking at me with wide eyes.
                        ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that you feel ‚Ä¶ hurt by this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat is a crap apology.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have to apologize for liking him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head, and flash on us doing homework after dinner. <i
                            class="calibre13">You should have a lot of friends. Ones you make on your own. Without
                            me.</i> ‚ÄúIs that why you were happy me and Iris are friends? So, like, I‚Äôm out of your hair
                        more often? So you could fool around behind my back?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú‚ÄòMake other friends, Claudia. Go out with other people, Claudia. Get out of
                        the house so me and Alex can make out and do all the stuff&mdash;‚Äô‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being ridiculous&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think you should go home.‚Äù I can barely control my voice. ‚ÄúI think Alex
                        should drive you home. Or, you know, you can go sleep in his room and have fun explaining that
                        to my parents in the morning.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being ridiculous.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre being a shitty friend.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks at me for a long moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she says finally, and grabs up her stuff. She doesn‚Äôt slam the door on
                        the way out&mdash;neither of us want to wake up my parents. I hear her pad across the hall,
                        knock lightly on Alex‚Äôs door. It swings open and shut. Shortly, I hear them both leave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I squeeze my eyes shut and fall back across the bed.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">The door opens and closes. I refuse to open my eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre awake.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFuck you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaudia. Geez.‚Äù He fumbles with the light switch, and when I finally look over
                        he‚Äôs standing there by my dresser, jacket still on over his rumpled pajamas.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow could you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe were gonna tell you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you even doing? Why are you even with her?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI love her, Claude,‚Äù he says, and there is an earnestness to it that only
                        serves to freak me out even more.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo you don‚Äôt,‚Äù I say, sitting up. ‚ÄúYou love Smash Bros., and chili-cheese
                        fries, and ‚Ä¶ <i class="calibre13">yourself</i>. You don‚Äôt love Zoe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôve always loved Zoe,‚Äù he says with that same intensity, a pleading look in
                        his eyes. ‚ÄúBut it just ‚Ä¶ changed. Recently. It became ‚Ä¶ stronger, and different, and better. I‚Äôm
                        better because of her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou are eighteen fucking years old and you sound like an idiot.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to&mdash;God, why do you have to make things so difficult? Why
                        can‚Äôt you just be cool about this? For once in your life, be cool and just ‚Ä¶ let me explain.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúExplain what? That you were bored because everyone you know went off to school
                        so you started dating my friend and lying to me about it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt lie, we never <i class="calibre13">lied</i>&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault you couldn‚Äôt go to college because you‚Äôre lazy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre15">He looks at me, and for a split second I flash on a
                        moment in the play I caught at rehearsal last week&mdash;the scene where Hermia and Helena are
                        about to fight. Sudha is so good at that part, her eyes narrowing, her back
                        straightening&mdash;<i class="calibre13">Ay, that way goes the game</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt bear the idea of her having something outside of you, can you?‚Äù he
                        says, eyes blazing. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stand the idea that she might move on from you. That you might
                        not be the sun that her life fucking orbits around anymore.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit, because, if anything, I‚Äôve moved on from her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This is not even remotely true, and we both know it. He shakes his head. ‚ÄúCome
                        on. Like I wasn‚Äôt in school with her for the last three years. Like I don‚Äôt know how many
                        friends she has there. A whole <i class="calibre13">life</i> without you, Claude. You want to
                        talk about lazy? You‚Äôre the laziest person I‚Äôve ever met! You made one friend in preschool and
                        then stopped trying!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù I say again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I think he‚Äôs going to say more, but he just stands there for a moment, and then
                        walks out.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">Viola Constantinople stands in the heart of a cavern, deep within the Mountains
                        of Gelbreth. The crystal in her hand casts a pool of light, but the cavern walls are too wide,
                        the ceiling too high, to illuminate more than a small patch around her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Havil the Wise stands before her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Tell me what I must do,</i> Viola says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs always odd to see your character speak. You spend so much of a game like
                        Battle Quest running around accomplishing tasks for people&mdash;take these scrolls, find these
                        elves, deliver these coins&mdash;and for all the nonplayer characters that talk to you in the
                        game, you rarely ever talk back. But when the preprogrammed cut scenes take over, suddenly
                        you‚Äôre not in control of your character anymore. Suddenly Viola is her own person.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">First, the kill,</i> Havil says<i class="calibre13">. It
                            must be clean, it must be swift, it must be complete.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Havil tells me what to do. And when the scene ends and I appear back outside
                        the entrance to the cavern, my chat window dings.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">I go to Indianapolis in the morning to visit Julia.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I know my mom would flip out if I drove all the way there alone. So I plan to
                        take the bus. But. I need a ride to the station.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-186" class="calibre15">As soon as it‚Äôs barely considered morning&mdash;I never
                        did fall back asleep&mdash;I call Gideon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris doesn‚Äôt drive, after all, or else I would‚Äôve called her. Funny how that
                        happened.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon actually picks up the phone. I was ready to leave a voice mail, unsure
                        if he‚Äôd be awake, unsure how not to sound sketch as hell in a text.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His voice is rough with sleep. ‚ÄúClaudia? You okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù No. ‚ÄúYeah, sorry. I just‚Ä¶‚Äù Tears prick my eyes. I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm
                        still upset about Zoe and Alex, obviously, but somehow his voice makes me feel ‚Ä¶ like I‚Äôve come
                        undone, I don‚Äôt know, and I still feel terrible about last night at the restaurant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat is it? What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I swallow. ‚ÄúI need a favor.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Gideon comes to pick me up. I walk down to the corner of our street and stand
                        outside the house there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A tree used to sit square in the front yard. It‚Äôs long since been taken down.
                        It was old and twisted, a large hollow in the front, branches splaying out like arms.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was, in fact, terrified of this tree as a kid. I don‚Äôt remember my first
                        encounter with ‚ÄúSpooky Tree,‚Äù but apparently at one of my earliest Halloween outings with Alex
                        and my parents, I burst into tears at the mere sight of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt was the most precious thing.‚Äù My mom has told the story time and time
                        again: ‚ÄúYour brother&mdash;just a little guy himself, mind you&mdash;runs up to the tree and
                        kicks it and goes, ‚Äò<i class="calibre13">Stop scaring my sister!</i>‚Äô‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That‚Äôs Alex. He kicked Spooky Tree for me. He was fearless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to be like Alex when I was little. You‚Äôd think it would be Julia. I
                        did want to be like her a little, I guess&mdash;I liked playing with her makeup, I liked putting
                        on her clothes and clomping around in her big boots. But Julia‚Äôs eleven years older. When I was
                        starting second grade, she was starting college.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex is just one year older, and he‚Äôs always been cooler than me, smarter and
                        funnier; he always knows what to say. Where he went, I followed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon pulls up to the curb in a shiny SUV.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù he says with a small smile when I open the door and pile in. His
                        hair is messy, and he‚Äôs wearing a hoodie and pajama pants.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry to wake you up,‚Äù I say, and busy myself clipping in my seat belt.
                        ‚ÄúSorry, I just‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be sorry,‚Äù he says quietly. He doesn‚Äôt go to take
                        the car out of park. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I feel super awesome about leaving you at a bus station,
                        though.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to visit my sister.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the TV movies. You could disappear, and it‚Äôll haunt me, and then
                        you‚Äôll show up like fifteen years later totally changed, and like‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúPretend I don‚Äôt know you but secretly I‚Äôm obsessed with you and your family?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúI would totally watch that movie, by the way.‚Äù
                        Then he frowns. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to live it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLiterally, I‚Äôm just going to take a bus to Indianapolis.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll drive you there.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only three hours. We can, like ‚Ä¶ listen to an audiobook or something. My
                        mom just got <i class="calibre13">The Brunelleschi Scrolls</i>. She said it‚Äôs supposed to be
                        like <i class="calibre13">The Da Vinci Code</i> but more convoluted. Apparently, there‚Äôs this
                        monk who wants to&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just want to take the bus,‚Äù I say, against my better judgment. ‚ÄúJust ‚Ä¶ by
                        myself.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nods. And looks forward. Nods again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah. Okay. But I‚Äôll wait with you until it comes?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you want to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He does. And when the bus comes, we stand up, and he sways toward me a little.
                        I get the feeling he wants to give me a hug. Like we‚Äôre parting for some significant period of
                        time. Like we‚Äôre ‚Ä¶ people who hug each other good-bye.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But he keeps his hands in the pocket of his hoodie, a half smile on his lips.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBe safe, okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. And then I hug him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Just briefly, so quick that he barely has time to take his hands out of his
                        hoodie and hug back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks for the ride,‚Äù I say, and then board the bus.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I listen to TION on the ride. Mostly their first album, which is arguably the
                        most upbeat, the most pop-sounding. Boppy songs about partying all night, interspersed with
                        ballads about love as deep as oceans. I sink into it all, try to pick out which band member is
                        singing what part&mdash;something that I‚Äôve improved at doing, and Iris is near genius at.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-188" class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt have much data left, but I watch a couple of
                        videos, too&mdash;behind-the-scenes vlogs released before the start of the current tour. One of
                        them features all five of the boys, squeezed onto a couch that‚Äôs really too small to accommodate
                        them, talking to the camera about the theme of the tour.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">‚ÄúThe management and, like, the people in charge,‚Äù</i>
                        Kenji says<i class="calibre13">. ‚ÄúThey said we shouldn‚Äôt call a tour ‚Äòheartbreakers,‚Äô that it
                            wasn‚Äôt good branding or whatever, if the fans think, like, we‚Äôd break their heart. They
                            don‚Äôt want you to think that. But we always said we were gonna stay true to us, and that‚Äôs
                            us. We‚Äôre not perfect guys; we‚Äôre, like, real, and that‚Äôs real, you know&mdash;getting your

                            know? Maybe we named it after the people who broke our hearts. Or the people who will.‚Äù</i>

                        rounder than it was the last time I saw her. <i class="calibre13">An egg with legs,</i> my mom
                        had said. <i class="calibre13">That‚Äôs how I looked when I was pregnant, that‚Äôs how Juju is going
                            to look. Like she‚Äôs trying to smuggle a basketball under her shirt.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We go to Julia and Mark‚Äôs apartment, a little place just north of downtown.
                        Mark‚Äôs working all day, so it‚Äôs just the two of us. I sit on the couch, and Julia makes us
                        lunch. Really, I should be the one cooking&mdash;isn‚Äôt that a thing, aren‚Äôt you supposed to give
                        pregnant people a rest?&mdash;but I‚Äôm in too much of a stupor to be properly considerate. So I
                        let Julia heat us up some chili on the stove, and I shut my eyes against the sting of the onions
                        she‚Äôs chopping up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She brings two bowls out for us when she‚Äôs done, and is extending one toward me
                        when her leg catches the side of the table; she jolts, and both bowls go flying, sending chili
                        spilling across the floor. She lets out an aborted ‚ÄúAH!‚Äù and then we both stare at the
                        chili-strewn carpet for a moment, until she promptly bursts into tears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I haven‚Äôt seen Julia cry in years. Not even at her wedding. Her voice got a
                        little wobbly as she said her vows, but that‚Äôs all.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But now Julia starts crying and crying and I forget my onion tears and my
                        Alex-and-Zoe turmoil and I remember that Julia was also playing Battle Quest at four o‚Äôclock
                        this morning, she was also not okay but she didn‚Äôt say why, just that the baby was fine and
                        everything was fine, it was ‚Äúall okay but you could come over if you want, you could come visit
                        for the weekend. If you want.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Julia sinks awkwardly down onto the floor and starts scooping the chili up with
                        her hands, still crying, and I can‚Äôt help but sputter a laugh.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-189" class="calibre15">‚ÄúLiterally, what are you doing? We‚Äôll get some paper
                        towels.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt get our deposit back,‚Äù she sobs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre crying. Because you won‚Äôt get your deposit back.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are we going to eat for lunch?‚Äù she says, looking at me totally serious,
                        eyes big and wet, lip quivering.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJulia, Jesus, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I get on the floor, too, and pick up one of the
                        spoons, trying to scoop up some chili, though this doesn‚Äôt seem like the most efficient method.
                        ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll call one of those rug doctor guys like on TV. We‚Äôll get McDonald‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She shakes her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing, Claude.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making it worse is what you‚Äôre doing. At least use the spoon.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She sits back, and it can‚Äôt be comfortable, can it? Carting a human around in
                        front of you like that. She rubs her nose with the back of her arm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can do this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe we could use the vacuum?‚Äù I start to get up, to grab some paper towels,
                        but the look on her face stops me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean any of it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAny of what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis. The wife thing, the mom thing.‚Äù Her mouth twists unhappily. ‚ÄúMostly the
                        mom thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause you spilled lunch?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not ‚Ä¶ wired right.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be an adult,‚Äù she says haltingly. ‚ÄúAnd like adult things. I‚Äôm
                        supposed to ‚Ä¶ care about stuff that‚Äôs bigger than myself, and I‚Äôm supposed to want to, you know,
                        fucking ‚Ä¶ be the best person I can be for my kid, but what if I&mdash;what if I‚Äôm defective?
                        What if they made me wrong? And I can‚Äôt do any of that stuff? What if I can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ <i
                            class="calibre13">feel</i> ‚Ä¶ any of that stuff? What do I do then? I can‚Äôt even be an adult
                        properly.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot helpful.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I say, sliding a bit closer. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ maybe you‚Äôre right. Maybe
                        you‚Äôre not built for every single one of the adult things. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be one way,
                        does it? It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a mold or something. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs prescribed.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut it is! Society prescribed it! I‚Äôm supposed to eat whole grain pasta and
                        bust a nut saving money on car insurance!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLook. Jujube&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo not fucking come at me with Jujube right now&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, listen, I think‚Ä¶‚Äù I pause. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be a mom.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, Claude. Did you forget you were supposed
                        to qualify that with something?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, because whether or not you‚Äôre a good one isn‚Äôt decided by some ‚Ä¶
                        committee, or something. Or society. Or anything. You decide that. You choose what kind of mom
                        you want to be. You choose ‚Ä¶ what kind of adult you want to be. Right? So maybe you‚Äôre an adult
                        who plays Battle Quest. And spills chili sometimes. Maybe you get things wrong occasionally.
                        Maybe that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She shakes her head. ‚ÄúIt just feels like‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice is small. ‚ÄúSometimes it
                        just feels like I‚Äôm faking.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe everyone feels that way.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She blinks at me, eyes still shiny. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just scared I‚Äôm gonna mess this kid
                        up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause I just do.‚Äù I look down at the carpet for a moment and then halfway
                        smile. ‚ÄúIn case you forgot, I came here so you could help me with my problems, not the other way
                        around.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUgh, okay.‚Äù She sniffs, presses the back of her wrist to her eyes, and when
                        she lowers her arm, she‚Äôs composed again in that Julia way of hers. She gets to her feet, and we
                        both stare at the chili for another moment. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fix this,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd then we‚Äôll fix your
                        Alex and Zoe thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We try to clean up as best we can. I get down and scrub the rug. The stains are
                        huge. Julia‚Äôs right&mdash;they probably won‚Äôt get their deposit back. But maybe Mark could rent
                        one of those carpet cleaners or something.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We get McDonald‚Äôs for lunch and sit on the couch and eat while watching a TV
                        show where a woman tries on several wedding dresses that make her feel magical, but
                        unfortunately her family hates each of them in different and creative ways. And only when the
                        woman has finally said YES to her dress does Julia put her Big Mac box aside, mute the TV, and
                        look over at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt even have to ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt tell me,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat sucks, I know. But what else?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you mean, what else?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the rest of the problem? Because there‚Äôs more to it than that, right?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shove the last handful of fries in my mouth and chew unhappily. She‚Äôs not
                        wrong. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different,‚Äù I say finally. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs gonna be different.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell her anything now without thinking she might tell
                        him. And same with Alex, I can‚Äôt&mdash;he‚Äôs supposed to be <i class="calibre13">my</i> brother,
                        and she‚Äôs supposed to be <i class="calibre13">my</i> friend, and it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶‚Äù I stare resolutely
                        at the TV screen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I‚Äôm losing both of them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut it feels like I am. They‚Äôre a thing now. They have their own thing, apart
                        from me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, people have things apart from you. Shocking. You know Mom and Dad dated
                        before we were born, right? You know that I existed for a good eleven years before you did?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey.‚Äù A different sister might slide down the sofa closer. Put her arm around
                        me. But Julia just blinks at me, shakes her head minutely. ‚ÄúThis is happening. It‚Äôs happened.
                        They‚Äôre together. So you can be okay with it. Or not. But they‚Äôre still gonna be together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat if they break up? What if it gets weird and Zoe doesn‚Äôt want to hang out
                        with me anymore?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt want them to be together, but also, you don‚Äôt want them to break
                        up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just&mdash;‚Äù I mash my fists against my eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want anything to change,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to get left
                        behind.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. ‚ÄúGive me some Mom advice,‚Äù I say when I can speak again. ‚ÄúGet some

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAsk Mom for Mom advice, geez. I have seventeen years before I have to deal

                    <p class="calibre15">I huff a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be okay,‚Äù Julia says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut everything‚Äôs gonna change.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not always a bad thing, is it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head begrudgingly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit,‚Äù she says, and unmutes the wedding dress show.</p>

                    <h2>forty-two</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">My dad picks me up from the bus station on Sunday. I get a long lecture about
                        going to Julia‚Äôs without permission (because apparently leaving a note and then calling them
                        from the bus was ‚Äúmore like asking for forgiveness than for permission‚Äù). It finishes off with a
                        ‚ÄúYou know you can talk to me about anything, you know we‚Äôre here for you‚Ä¶‚Äù which implies that
                        they know about my freak-out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex is gone when I get home. We eat dinner. My folks watch <i
                            class="calibre13">Wheel of Fortune</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Before I left her place, Julia gave me a Tupperware of cookies she had baked.
                        ‚ÄúYou can give them to Zoe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDifficult conversations are at least one and a half times
                        easier if there are cookies.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to talk.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThen give them to Gideon,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúYou can thank him for getting up at
                        ass o‚Äôclock and helping you get here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I sit in my dad‚Äôs car in the driveway for a bit, staring at the cookies in the
                        passenger seat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then I drive to Gideon‚Äôs house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I knock on the front door, but then I figure it‚Äôs so big they may not hear, so
                        I press the doorbell. It‚Äôs quiet, and I feel like a complete and total idiot&mdash;I should‚Äôve
                        called or texted, I should‚Äôve said something and now I‚Äôm here and even if I leave right now and
                        take the cookies with me, I will still know the private shame of having come in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm considering bolting when the door swings open and reveals Victoria.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her face brightens on seeing me. ‚ÄúClaudia!‚Äù She turns and bellows back into the
                        depths of the house: ‚ÄúGIDEON. CLAUDIA‚ÄôS HERE.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When she turns back, her gaze drops to the Tupperware in my hands. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you
                        bring?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCookies.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid you make them? For Gideon?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-192" class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm. My sister did. Not, like, <i
                            class="calibre13">for</i> Gideon exactly, but I thought maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon appears at the end of the hallway in sweatpants and sock feet and rushes
                        our way, sliding the last few feet and catching himself on the doorjamb before he pitches clear
                        through the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaudia, hey! Hi. I was just. We were just&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWatching the Disney Channel,‚Äù Victoria helpfully supplies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat is ‚Ä¶ exactly what we were doing,‚Äù he says, looking a little chagrined but
                        pulling out a smile all the same. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI, uh, I just wanted to drop these off.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His eyes light up upon seeing the cookies. ‚ÄúDid you make them?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMy sister did. They‚Äôre just the break-and-bake kind.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThose are my favorite.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo they‚Äôre not,‚Äù Victoria says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, how about you head upstairs and start getting ready for bed?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs seven o‚Äôclock.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow about you head upstairs and just ‚Ä¶ stay there?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They look at each other for a long moment and seem to be having some kind of
                        nonverbal sibling communication. Finally Victoria sighs and steps away from the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI get half of those cookies.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù Gideon says, turning back to me as Victoria retreats. ‚ÄúCome in. Want to
                        hang out?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm, sure. I can for a little bit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I follow him into the house and to the family room, where the TV is currently
                        showing <i class="calibre13">High School Musical 3</i>. He shuts it off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe can go in here,‚Äù he says, leading me back down the hall to a door at the
                        end. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, uh, you know. Quieter.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He opens the door to reveal the biggest home office I‚Äôve ever seen. It looks
                        like something out of a movie&mdash;all warm wood paneling and shelves lined with books. Thick
                        curtains and paintings and a fireplace with a leather couch and two club chairs situated in
                        front of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watch as Gideon goes over to a table up against the far wall, between two big
                        picture windows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMy dad keeps his record player in here. He lets me use it whenever I want,‚Äù he
                        says. ‚ÄúSometimes I&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He stops himself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looks sheepish. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I really think vinyl sounds so much better.
                        Sometimes I just want to come in here ‚Äôcause my dad‚Äôs here. I don‚Äôt get to see him a lot.‚Äù He
                        busies himself flipping through records on one of the shelves to his left. He turns and holds
                        one up. ‚ÄúDo you know them?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre15">It‚Äôs Drunk Residential‚Äôs third album.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He puts it on and then his eyes widen. ‚ÄúSorry. I forgot about the cookies. I
                        don‚Äôt know how anyone forgets about cookies.‚Äù He reaches out and takes the Tupperware from me
                        and then gestures me over to the fireplace seating arrangement. I watch as he sinks down onto
                        the leather couch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pick one of the club chairs adjacent to it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo I ‚Ä¶ I just wanted to thank you. For taking me to the bus station
                        yesterday.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo problem. I‚Äôm always up for a trip to the bus station.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I raise an eyebrow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre the person who needs to go to the bus station. Then I‚Äôm up for it,‚Äù
                        he amends with a grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt know what to say to that, so I look at the painting over the fireplace,
                        which depicts an ocean scene. The colors are vibrant, but it‚Äôs oddly calming somehow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I look back, Gideon‚Äôs tearing into the cookies. He extends the Tupperware
                        my way, but I shake my head. ‚ÄúDid you have fun with your sister?‚Äù he asks between biles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We watched a lot of TV and ate a lot of junk food and played a lot of Battle
                        Quest. It was our version of fun.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod, and then it‚Äôs quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you want to play Connect Four?‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of amazing at it.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I say, and he gives me an odd look. I flush. ‚ÄúI read it on
                        JustGideonPrewittThings.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon groans. ‚ÄúYou tell one person you like soggy cereal and suddenly you‚Äôre a
                        fucking meme.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know, the crunch is kind of the thing people like best about cereal.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, the milk and the cereal working together is the thing people like best
                        about cereal. Why wouldn‚Äôt you want maximum interaction between the two most essential parts of
                        the meal?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs cereal a meal?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe way I make it, it is.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can‚Äôt help but grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI will make you Froot Loops. You‚Äôll never go back.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay. Make me some Froot Loops right now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúRight this second?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-194" class="calibre15">I nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Gideon makes us bowls of cereal, but while it‚Äôs sitting on the counter
                        ‚Äúmarinating,‚Äù we go back to his dad‚Äôs office and play a round of Connect Four. Drunk Residential
                        is still playing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He wins the first game. ‚ÄúI feel like vigilance is key,‚Äù he tells me as we go to
                        retrieve our cereal. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my best strategy for Connect Four.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs glorified tic-tac-toe. You realize that, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey added a fourth objective. You need to achieve thirty-three percent more
                        than in tic-tac-toe, plus they‚Äôve dimensionalized it. It‚Äôs three-dimensional!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt mention JustGideonPrewittThings again, but apparently the entry I had
                        seen&mdash;<i class="calibre13">Weirdly passionate about Connect 4</i>&mdash;is entirely
                        accurate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I go for a spoonful of the cereal as we stand at the kitchen counter. It‚Äôs
                        soggy and terrible. My face likely communicates that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon frowns. ‚ÄúNot good?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I chew. Sort of. It‚Äôs not really required. ‚ÄúI kind of definitely prefer it the
                        old-fashioned way.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you more.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to waste it,‚Äù I say, though I don‚Äôt want to eat it either.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll eat yours, too.‚Äù He makes a new bowl and presents it to me, and then
                        carries both my old one and his back to his dad‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúSo crunchy cereal only. First entry
                        for JustClaudiaWallaceThings.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUgh. No one would follow that account.‚Äù It‚Äôs the same thing Iris said about my
                        ‚Äúupdate account,‚Äù and it‚Äôs not wrong.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú‚ÄôCause there‚Äôs nothing to say.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He makes a noise of outrage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚Äú<i class="calibre13">Crunchy cereal only</i> is the first entry!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs confirmed that like ninety-nine percent of the population likes
                        crunchy cereal only.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI need to see some literature on that.‚Äù He sinks back down on the couch, and
                        this time I join him. ‚ÄúI would follow JustClaudiaWallaceThings. There are so many of them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúName three.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI will name <i class="calibre13">six</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I purse my lips, trying to suppress a smile. ‚ÄúOkay. Go.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNumber one, looks good in yellow.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bit subjective.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre15">‚ÄúSome Gideon Prewitt things are subjective. <i
                            class="calibre13">Sings better than you would expect but not as good as he thinks he
                            does</i>? Subjective.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mean. Who said that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy, are you going to fight them?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI could.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt doubt that.‚Äù He grins. ‚ÄúNumber two, wants to slay the Lord of Wizard,
                        has all the skills to do so. Number three, uncommonly good at Shakespeare. Number four, master
                        deflector. Number five, super smart&mdash;see number three, uncommonly good at Shakespeare.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His gaze darts back and forth between me and his cereal bowl.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNumber six, best laugh. Ever.‚Äù His eyes land on me, fix there for a moment.
                        ‚ÄúWhen you make Claudia Wallace laugh, you feel like you‚Äôve earned something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I swallow. I want to look away, but I can‚Äôt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a snort,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúLike
                        a snort chortle. It‚Äôs a snortle.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He moves a little closer. ‚ÄúIs that a Pok√©mon?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you want to go to Homecoming with me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. PLSG and Danforth have Homecoming together, alternating which campus
                        hosts each year. I‚Äôve never gone. Junior prom with Will Sorenson was going to be my first foray
                        into school dances.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I surprise myself with my answer: ‚ÄúYeah. Okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAwesome.‚Äù He smiles. ‚ÄúNow tell me that second bowl isn‚Äôt the best cereal

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs lame.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She glances over at me. ‚ÄúHave you ever been?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shrug. ‚ÄúNot really my thing.‚Äù Though I loved when Zoe would tell me about her
                        Homecomings. Somehow it always seemed like putting everyone in formal wear and adding a deejay
                        upped the chances for Major Drama. School Dance Drama was a whole different breed than your
                        average, run-of-the-mill Drama. Even though I didn‚Äôt want to live it, I always liked hearing
                        about it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Though right now the thought of Zoe makes something in my stomach twist. We
                        haven‚Äôt talked since Friday night. I didn‚Äôt see her online once this weekend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs Homecoming like?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou have to wear a stupid outfit and listen to stupid songs and dance stupid
                        dances,‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGeez, don‚Äôt hold back. Poor Homecoming‚Äôs not even here to defend itself.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt sucks.‚Äù She fumbles with the strap of her book bag. It‚Äôs quiet for a

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUnless you really like the person you go with. Then it sucks less.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe you should give it a try,‚Äù she says as we make our way up the path to

                    <p class="calibre1">Thursday rolls around. I still haven‚Äôt talked to Zoe, and the door to Alex‚Äôs
                        room has been shut every time I‚Äôve gotten home, and stayed shut for the remainder of the

                    <p class="calibre15">But come Thursday, rain or shine, without fail, Zoe and I go to Roosevelt-Hart
                        to volunteer. So I put on my blue shirt and I drive to her house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôs sitting on the front steps, waiting for me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She gets into the car, wordlessly, and I pull away from the curb.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The radio is on, some generic club song playing, all sirens and whistles. I
                        switch it off without thinking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI like that song,‚Äù she says finally.</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI could.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt acknowledge the possibility of her liking something without me knowing
                        about it. I don‚Äôt turn the radio back on either.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs just as quiet on the ride home until I pull to a stop in front of Zoe‚Äôs
                        house. She unclicks her seat belt and pauses, her expression blank.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAlex and I broke up,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSee you next week.‚Äù She gets out of the car.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù I switch off the car and jump out. ‚ÄúWhy did you do that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy do you think, Claudia?‚Äù She turns, halfway to the front door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want you to break up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want us to date either.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hear Julia‚Äôs words: <i class="calibre13">So you don‚Äôt want them to be
                            together, but also, you don‚Äôt want them to break up.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt&mdash;look, I just, I needed to&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done, Claude. It‚Äôs fine.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fine.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you,‚Äù she says, and goes inside, shutting the door definitively.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could knock on the door, or just follow her in, but I don‚Äôt even know what
                        I‚Äôd say. I can‚Äôt act like this isn‚Äôt what I wanted because maybe some small part of me did. I
                        get back in my car, rest my head against the headrest, squeeze my eyes shut.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-197" class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">When I get home, I hear music coming from Alex‚Äôs room. I knock lightly on his
                        door. ‚ÄúAlex?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He doesn‚Äôt answer.</p>

                    <h2>forty-four</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Homecoming is a thing that happens.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon picks me up. He‚Äôs wearing a black suit with a ruffly shirt that should
                        look terrible but somehow does not look the least bit terrible.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wear a dress I wore to my cousin‚Äôs wedding last year. It‚Äôs nothing
                        particularly special, but Gideon tell me it‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeautiful. Radiant. Excellence,‚Äù and I can‚Äôt stop
                        smiling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He gives me flowers&mdash;pink tulips&mdash;and we stand in the kitchen while
                        my mom puts them in a vase and exclaims over them as if he‚Äôd brought them for her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She lets us go after she‚Äôs taken our picture several dozen times. ‚ÄúHave fun,
                        and don‚Äôt stay out too late. Back by twelve, okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you have your phone?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd Gideon‚Äôs driving safe, right?‚Äù she says expectantly, like Gideon was
                        planning to run us off the road.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon‚Äôs prepping for the Indy 500. We‚Äôre going to do a few laps around the
                        block, practice for pole position.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true,‚Äù he says, eyes wide.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo worries, Gideon, I know exactly how sarcastic my daughter can be. Have fun,
                        okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon takes my hand. ‚ÄúWe will,‚Äù he says, and we leave the kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look down at our clasped hands in the hall, and Gideon hesitates, loosening
                        his grip as if to let go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs this okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I give his hand a squeeze. ‚ÄúOnly because it‚Äôs Saturday.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDoes that make a difference?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, I mean, hand-holding on a Tuesday is pretty risqu√©.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His lips quirk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a quarter moon, you know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat happens on the quarter moon?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI turn into a quarter werewolf.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Danforth‚Äôs gym is transformed for the dance, and everyone in it is transformed a
                        bit, too. Themselves, but now in formal wear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We run into people we know and say hello like we don‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs faces
                        five out of every seven days, like we hadn‚Äôt just seen one another a day ago in class. It‚Äôs kind
                        of funny.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alicia greets me with a kiss on each cheek. I had no idea we were so
                        cosmopolitan. Or that we were that friendly. But she smiles at me and compliments my dress and
                        then slips her arm through Noah‚Äôs. He‚Äôs a good few inches shorter than her in her heels, and
                        they make a striking pair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou guys look adorable,‚Äù she says to Gideon and me both.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThanks. You too,‚Äù I say, because that seems like the kind of thing people say.
                        Alicia flags down someone to take a picture of all of us, and as she‚Äôs flipping through her
                        phone afterward, she says, ‚ÄúIris was looking for you, by the way.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs here?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù A new song starts up. ‚ÄúOoh, I love this one! Let‚Äôs dance.‚Äù She grabs
                        Noah, and off they go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We find Iris sitting on the bleachers, her purse on her lap. She brightens a
                        little when she notices our approach.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Even in the dim twinkly light of the gym, I can see her dress is very pretty,
                        and very pink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you were coming.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd just ‚Ä¶ check it out. Just to see.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen Paige yet,‚Äù Gideon says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy would I care?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I mentioned it. Expressly because I
                        know how much you don‚Äôt care.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù she says, but not without a small smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWanna dance?‚Äù Gideon says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes, go dance, go away, both of you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI was talking to you,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe can all dance.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a second, I‚Äôm reminded of Iris and Paige way back when, dancing together in
                        front of the literature building. Iris holding back until Paige took her hands, then the both of
                        them jumping around, uninhibited.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Right now she levels Gideon with a look and is met with his easy smile. Then
                        she shifts her gaze to me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fun.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris sighs, getting to her feet. ‚ÄúUgh, sure, I guess. If it‚Äôll pass the time.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It passes the time quite well. Gideon is a ridiculous dancer, but I would‚Äôve
                        expected no less.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">People, as always, seem to gravitate toward him, so we get a good group going.
                        Gideon twirls Iris around and hip-bumps Noah and busts out all sorts of moves&mdash;some
                        successfully, some not so much&mdash;and basically doesn‚Äôt stop until finally a slow song
                        filters on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then he looks at me hesitantly. ‚ÄúWant to dance?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat have we been doing for the last hour?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI meant, like, with me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWho have I been dancing with all this time? Did someone get a face transplant
                        with your face?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He grins. ‚ÄúYou know what I‚Äôm saying.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance around, but the rest of the group has melted away. Even Iris has
                        disappeared.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So I step up to Gideon and clasp my hands loosely behind his neck. I mean to
                        leave some space, but he steps closer, circling his arms around my waist so it‚Äôs more of a hug
                        than a traditional dance hold.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We sway back and forth. My entire front is warm. Everything is Gideon Prewitt
                        sensory overload, but then I don‚Äôt think there could even be such a thing. I don‚Äôt think there
                        could ever be too much of him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou never definitively responded to the face transplant thing,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you need me to confirm my identity?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes. Say something only Gideon Prewitt would say.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúConnect Four is the greatest game ever invented.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve looked that up online.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBloomin‚Äô Onion,‚Äù he whispers right in my ear, and it tickles but also sends a
                        spark of electricity through me. I let out a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He laughs, too, his shoulders rising and falling a bit, and then it‚Äôs quiet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Until Gideon murmurs, ‚ÄúThanks for coming with me tonight.‚Äù His mouth is still
                        close to my ear. ‚ÄúI really, um.‚Äù He pulls back the slightest bit, looks at me for a second. ‚ÄúI
                        really like it when we hang out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSometimes ‚Ä¶ around some people, I feel like I have to, like ‚Ä¶ <i
                            class="calibre13">try</i>, you know? Like really hard.‚Äù His hands tighten a bit on my waist.
                        ‚ÄúBut with you &mdash;when I‚Äôm with you, I can just ‚Ä¶ exist. You know what I mean?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-200" class="calibre15">His expression is open, his eyes serious.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I know exactly what he means.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. And stare at the stitching on Gideon‚Äôs lapel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He stops swaying, ducks his head to try to look at me. ‚ÄúClaude?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Someone taps my shoulder. ‚ÄúClaudia, will you take our picture?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs Lena, dressed in yet another variation on her patented minidress. She‚Äôs
                        holding her phone out to me, smiling expectantly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mechanically I step away from Gideon and take the phone, snapping a few
                        pictures of her and Sudha and Madison, their arms around one another.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I look back at Gideon, he‚Äôs running one hand through his hair, a chagrined
                        sort of smile on his face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I try to return it, but I‚Äôm not sure how convincing it is. ‚ÄúI, uh. I need to
                        find Iris,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI have to ask her about something.‚Äù I know he‚Äôll offer to look with me, so I
                        break away, calling ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back‚Äù over my shoulder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The lawn dividing the gym from the parking lot is perfectly manicured, and the
                        grass is soft and plush beneath my shoes as I cut across it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I make it to the sidewalk bordering the lot. I don‚Äôt have my coat, or my phone,
                        but I don‚Äôt care.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">When I‚Äôm with you, I can just</i> exist<i
                            class="calibre13">.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs the same notion as Will Sorenson‚Äôs, isn‚Äôt it? Just packaged differently.
                        Someone you exist around. Someone you feel regular about.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I want to deny it, squish it down to nothing, go back inside, throw my arms
                        around Gideon again. But I can‚Äôt. Or rather, I can, but I won‚Äôt, because I know the
                        truth&mdash;it‚Äôs over before it‚Äôs even started.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I just need air. I just need to be alone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But I‚Äôm not. Not for long, anyway. I hear a set of footsteps making their way
                        from the gym.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, I saw Iris but she disappeared again, you‚Äôd think she‚Äôs&mdash;‚Äù Gideon
                        pauses when he reaches me. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù And then, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold, geez,‚Äù and he‚Äôs shrugging out of
                        his suit jacket and it‚Äôs all too much.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs this a date?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He blinks, extending the coat toward me, but I don‚Äôt take it. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs a ‚Ä¶
                        it‚Äôs a dance date. Not like a ‚Ä¶ <i class="calibre13">date</i> date. But still kind of a date?‚Äù
                        There is a hopeful upward inflection at the end of that sentence. ‚ÄúI was actually ‚Ä¶ I sort of
                        wanted to ask you about that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe you and me could ‚Ä¶ maybe we could go on a date. A real one. Maybe we
                        could be, like. Dating.‚Äù There‚Äôs a small smile on his lips, and he‚Äôs still holding the coat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm meant to say something. I‚Äôm supposed to respond.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">I like you, you majestic space
                            prince</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">How hard would it be to say that? It‚Äôs the truth. How hard would it be to close
                        the distance between us? Thread my fingers through his hair, thumb the corners of his jaw, kiss
                        him right.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm the kind of person you feel regular about. I know that. And if anyone is
                        going to find me ‚Ä¶ <i class="calibre13">not</i> regular ‚Ä¶ it certainly isn‚Äôt going to be Gideon
                        Prewitt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And if he thinks he does, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm amusing, the same way trick birthday
                        candles are amusing. Just in the moment, just situationally. Interesting until they aren‚Äôt,
                        diverting until they‚Äôve served their purpose. He likes that he can exist around me&mdash;he
                        likes it now&mdash;but he doesn‚Äôt even realize it, that it‚Äôs the very reason his feelings will
                        wear off later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I force myself to speak: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really ‚Ä¶ flattering. You know. But ‚Ä¶ I just
                        think ‚Ä¶ Maybe it‚Äôs not such a good idea.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI just ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just trying to look out for myself.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, you wouldn‚Äôt, would you?‚Äù I say, and he frowns, takes a step forward.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid I do something wrong?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGideon, it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶‚Äù I shake my head. I can‚Äôt look him in the eyes, so I look up
                        instead. I speak to the velvety sky above, my breath billowing up so that the words appear to
                        puff out of me: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre great, you‚Äôre lots of fun, but I just don‚Äôt think of you that way, okay?
                        I‚Äôm not ‚Ä¶ interested ‚Ä¶ in you like that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This is a lie, and some small stupid part of me hopes that Gideon will
                        challenge it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But he doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs quiet. Until finally he says, ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù And then, softer: ‚ÄúOh.
                        I thought you were.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I think of Havil the Wise: <i class="calibre13">The kill, young warrior. It
                            must be clean, it must be swift, it must be complete.</i> ‚ÄúYeah. Well. You were wrong.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I dare to glance at Gideon, he‚Äôs looking off across the parking lot, the
                        coat now hanging limply at his side.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan we still be friends though?‚Äù he says, small.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I reply. And I want that to be the end of this conversation. I
                        want him to walk away. And maybe he‚Äôll turn back at the last moment with a wink and a cheeky
                        grin because he doesn‚Äôt really like me. Not really. He just thinks he does, and this will cure
                        him of it. He‚Äôll head inside and dance the night away with the masses.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre15">But he just looks in my general direction, and when he
                        speaks, it‚Äôs halting, stilted in a way I‚Äôve never heard him speak before.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if ‚Ä¶ like, if I made you&mdash;uncomfortable, or anything. I didn‚Äôt
                        ‚Ä¶ I thought‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre still friends?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I nod, too vigorously. I can salvage this. I can make it okay. I can be
                        so chill.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hold one hand up and say ‚ÄúHigh five?‚Äù like the colossal idiot I am. Gideon
                        just smiles, lopsided, and he‚Äôs blinking fast.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm just gonna&mdash;I think I‚Äôll&mdash;‚Äù And then he nods, like he finished
                        the thought, and walks away, in the opposite direction of the gym.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I lower my hand.</p>

                    <h2>forty-five</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">I find Iris in the gym, back on the bleachers in the same spot we found her
                        earlier.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you want to go?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She frowns. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan we just go? Please?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks at me for one beat more, and then she stands, tucks her clutch under
                        one arm, and guides me out of the gym.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We go back outside, and I‚Äôm halfway crying by the time I realize that Gideon
                        drove me, so I have no way to get home. I‚Äôd have to call my parents and try to explain how I
                        rejected my date mid-dance, or Alex, who‚Äôs not speaking to me, or Zoe, who would have to borrow
                        a car and is still probably not speaking to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look over at Iris, who‚Äôs now on the phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCalling a ride,‚Äù she says, before having a brief conversation with whoever‚Äôs
                        on the other end of the line.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A sleek black sedan whispers up to the curb a few minutes later, and we both
                        get in the back. The driver is not Iris‚Äôs mom or dad but rather a youngish-looking guy in a
                        suit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTell him your address,‚Äù she says as we strap in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou have a driver?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she says, but it‚Äôs in direct contradiction to the person currently
                        sitting in the front seat. I blink at her, and she elaborates. ‚ÄúMy parents have a driver.
                        Sometimes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I give the man my address, and we ride in silence for a few minutes until Iris
                        finally heaves a sigh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo I have to do the whole ‚Äòtell me what happened‚Äô thing, or can you just tell
                        me what happened?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou just did the thing,‚Äù I say, and sniff.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaudia.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I squeeze my eyes shut and tell her what happened in the parking lot with
                        Gideon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing us both a favor,‚Äù I say when I‚Äôm finished. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being responsible.
                        This is better than‚Ä¶‚Äù Than doing the whole thing. Hanging out and dating and getting attached
                        and feeling feelings and having them be meaningless afterward.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris nods. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTell me I did the right thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat if I can‚Äôt?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThen <i class="calibre13">lie</i>, Iris, that‚Äôs what friends do,‚Äù I say,
                        before a sob escapes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou did the right thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt reply for a moment, and when she does, her voice is even, measured.
                        ‚ÄúBecause I know you. And I know ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd do what you thought was the right thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut it feels terrible,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She reaches out and pats my shoulder awkwardly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink through the tears. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? What is that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She pulls her hand away. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm bad at this. Do you want a bottle
                        of water?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! They keep them in the car! And you‚Äôre like ‚Ä¶ losing fluids. I
                        said I was bad at this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I let out a weak laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, look at that,‚Äù Iris says, and she almost looks proud. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm better
                        than I thought.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wipe my eyes on the back of my arm. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet. Until Iris pulls out her phone. ‚ÄúSome pap pictures of Kenji went up
                        earlier, do you want to see?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod, and she pulls up an impressive array of photos of Kenji in skinny jeans
                        and a slouchy hat, looking disgruntled as he walks into a fro-yo store and then out of a fro-yo
                        store.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe wore that shirt when the boys were on <i class="calibre13">The Tonight
                            Show</i>,‚Äù Iris says, and taps the photo, zooms in on Kenji‚Äôs shirt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Gucci. Do you
                        like it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. ‚ÄúHe looks good in blue.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid you ever see the suit he wore to the VMAs last year?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGod, you‚Äôve missed so much. Okay. Brace yourself.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I manage a small smile.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Iris looks up from the phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù <i class="calibre13">I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.</i> ‚ÄúShow me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I get a text about an hour after Iris drops me off. Gideon.</p>

                    <h2>forty-six</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Monday brings the first tech rehearsal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs an all-afternoon, into-the-evening affair. A handful of people are called
                        to the shop at the start to pick up specific costume pieces that they want to rehearse with.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kaitlyn Winthrop needs her skirt, which is a little tougher to move around in
                        than the other fairies‚Äô outfits. I help her get it on and then fuss with it a bit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon has come, too, to get his cloak. I manage to only glance his way when
                        he‚Äôs spinning around for Del to assess. After she adjusts a few little things and pronounces him
                        finished, she turns to help Aimee with her stuff.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAll done?‚Äù Kaitlyn says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm.‚Äù I turn back to the seam I‚Äôm supposed to be fixing, smooth it down, and
                        nod. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good to go. Let me know if you need anything else.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù she says, and when I look up, I see she‚Äôs addressing
                        Gideon, who‚Äôs come up behind us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúRavishing,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kaitlyn grins. ‚ÄúYou look like a sexy pirate.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Gideon says quite seriously, and then Kaitlyn heads off to talk to
                        Caris. Leaving me and Gideon alone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silence. I start sifting through my sewing kit like I‚Äôm looking for something.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He picks up a pincushion on the table beside us and then puts it back down.
                        ‚ÄúHey. So ‚Ä¶ sorry for leaving you hanging the other night. High-five-wise.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Sorry for abandoning you at the dance.</i> ‚ÄúNo problem.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon shifts from one foot to the other. Scratches the back of his neck. I
                        almost want to laugh&mdash;with him wearing that cloak, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm having a really awkward
                        moment with some mercenary mage in Battle Quest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he says after a pause. ‚ÄúYou know, if I made things weird. I
                        thought‚Ä¶‚Äù I glance at him, and he‚Äôs looking off across the room, his eyebrows pulled down. ‚ÄúI
                        thought about it, and I realized you always ‚Ä¶ I mean, you‚Äôve always been really nice and
                        friendly, but you‚Äôve never done anything to&mdash;like, encourage me, and I think I was just
                        seeing something there because I wanted something to be there, and I&mdash;I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-205" class="calibre15">When I speak, it comes out kind of short, kind of gruff,
                        because I don‚Äôt know how else to control my voice: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. Don‚Äôt be sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nods.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I go back to my kit. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Gideon just stands there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del finishes with Aimee, and Aimee pauses at the door, waiting for Gideon.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou should probably get back,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah. Okay. I ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll see you, I guess.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod, then say ‚ÄúSee you‚Äù tightly. Gideon and Aimee leave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I drop my sewing. Lower my head into my hands and squeeze my eyes shut.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy are you doing this to yourself?‚Äù comes Del‚Äôs voice from the corner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you ever not listening? Seriously.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt dignify that with a direct response. ‚ÄúIs this about whatever Lena
                        said to you at Brunati‚Äôs?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say. I hear Del move across the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I open my eyes, she is standing on the other side of the worktable,
                        leaning against it and looking right at me. ‚ÄúSay it again to my face.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del just shakes her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why you would listen to her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about <i class="calibre13">listening</i>. It‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">He loves something until he doesn‚Äôt</i>. ‚ÄúIf someone says
                        the thing that you‚Äôre afraid of ‚Ä¶ If someone thinks it, and you think it, too, then it has to be
                        at least a little bit true, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit,‚Äù Del says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs it, though? It‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ someone agreeing with you. It‚Äôs like validation.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre both wrong. Did you ever think of that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt reply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs not about Lena, not really. It‚Äôs just easier to never start something than
                        to have to see it end.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We break for dinner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris comes to the shop, and we split the Pinky‚Äôs sub I brought. Four point five
                        inches of sandwich apiece. She tells me about tech thus far, which involved a lot of stopping
                        and starting and people forgetting their lines. She says <i class="calibre13">people</i>
                        emphatically.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre15">‚ÄúLena?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She shakes her head, a wrinkle between her brows. ‚ÄúPaige.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe was having trouble.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI hope everything‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Iris says quietly, pulling a piece of shredded
                        lettuce out of her sandwich and frowning at it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with that lettuce.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI meant with Paige.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know, but you‚Äôre giving the lettuce a suspicious look.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat makes you the lettuce expert?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, I do work at Pinky‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris blinks at me, still frowning. ‚ÄúYou work at Pinky‚Äôs?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSeriously? What else are you hiding? Do you also work for the CIA?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not <i class="calibre13">hiding</i>, I just ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs never come up. I
                        haven‚Äôt been working much since we‚Äôve been doing the show anyway.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJust. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù She looks up, almost hesitant. ‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ am sorry. For the
                        paper. That we had to do this because we&mdash;because <i class="calibre13">I</i>&mdash;fucked
                        up the paper. I‚Äôm sorry if it, like ‚Ä¶ disrupted your life.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink down at the Pinky‚Äôs wrapper, having already decimated my
                        four-point-five inches of sandwich.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, no.‚Äù I look back up at Iris. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm kind of glad the show
                        happened. Even with‚Ä¶‚Äù Everything. Even with everything.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúA little bit. Maybe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah comes by after the dinner break to practice getting the donkey head on and
                        off for his big transformation scene. One of us will need to be backstage during the show to
                        help him with it, so we all run through it a few times.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They‚Äôre about to start teching this scene, so Del turns to me when we‚Äôre
                        finished. ‚ÄúClaudia, why don‚Äôt you go back up with him?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glance at Noah, who is fumbling with one of the ears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, sure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So I get custody of the donkey head, and we head back up together.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre15">As soon as the door to the shop closes behind us, Noah
                        speaks. ‚ÄúHey, so it‚Äôs probably none of my business, but ‚Ä¶ did something happen with Gideon?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say, starting down the hall toward the stairs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôs been acting weird since Homecoming.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI thought he told you everything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe does. So it‚Äôs particularly weird that he hasn‚Äôt said why he‚Äôs being weird.‚Äù
                        We reach the staircase and head up in silence. But Noah stops at the top. ‚ÄúLook, I just ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm
                        just worried about him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I think of the babies in sailor suits, and <i class="calibre13">did you ever
                            want a brother too?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">I already have one, remember?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe asked me out,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI said no. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah blinks. ‚ÄúI thought you guys liked each other.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù I start toward the auditorium.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pause as we reach the door to the theater. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know how to like
                        something for more than ten minutes,‚Äù I say. Lena‚Äôs words on my lips. ‚ÄúHe refuses to go to
                        parties because of the cups. He remembers the presents people give him but not the people
                        themselves. That‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just how he is, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah just shakes his head. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know him at all.‚Äù He starts through the
                        door but then turns back. ‚ÄúFor real. If you think that, then you don‚Äôt know him at all.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then he walks away.</p>

                    <h2>forty-seven</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Tech runs mostly smooth on Tuesday&mdash;they make it all the way through to the
                        end of the show, at least&mdash;and Wednesday brings the first dress rehearsal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige comes into the shop for a costume fix after school, before everyone‚Äôs due
                        in the auditorium for the run-through. Del and Caris are occupied, so it falls to me to help
                        her. I try to chat about the show while I adjust the straps on her top, but she seems
                        distracted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I finally give up on conversation, she speaks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre you, um.‚Äù Paige looks up at the ceiling and then says in a rush, ‚ÄúAre you
                        and Iris dating?‚Äù Before I can answer, or even react, she goes on: ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm being unfair, I
                        know we broke up, and I don‚Äôt have any right to know her business but, like, do you like her,
                        are you guys dating?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut ‚Ä¶ she seems really ‚Ä¶ happy. Around you. And I noticed, at Homecoming‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI noticed that you came with Gideon, but you left with Iris. And then he
                        seemed kind of upset when I saw him later.‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDoes he think I turned him down for Iris?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, but I sort of just ‚Ä¶ figured. Wait, so you did turn him down?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo. I mean, yes, I did, but not for Iris. We‚Äôre not together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Only because I am actively working on Paige‚Äôs torso do I note the little breath
                        she releases at that. A small sigh of something that can only be relief.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I have to tell Iris. Iris, who was sitting on the bleachers at Homecoming in
                        that pink dress, several months too late to be wearing it, but wearing it all the same.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del suddenly appears at my shoulder, batting my hand away. ‚ÄúNot like that. Let
                        me. Look at Josie‚Äôs hem, will you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. Josie is busy admiring herself in the mirror. Her fairy costume is
                        pretty awesome, if I do say so myself. Not that I had any hand in designing it, but I did sew
                        the shirt and collar, and the petticoat that Del constructed looks awesome. But Josie snagged a
                        hem during rehearsal yesterday, so I make her stand still, and I start pinning.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre15">I finish with Josie, and she leaves just as Iris arrives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She spots Del and Paige, laughing about something, and scowls instantly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, come here,‚Äù I say, but Iris barely gives me a glance. ‚ÄúI have to <i
                            class="calibre13">tell you something important</i>.‚Äù There is no way to communicate <i
                            class="calibre13">Paige is still into you</i> with my eyes, especially not when Paige and
                        Del are standing so close together and Iris can‚Äôt rip her gaze away from them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going, Del?‚Äù Iris says loudly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del glances up, looking decidedly put off. ‚ÄúFine, Iris. How are you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI was wondering if you heard from any other design schools yet, or if you had
                        just been rejected from the one so far.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Oh shit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your problem?‚Äù Del says, lips curving into a smile that is zero percent
                        friendly and 100 percent bad news for Iris. ‚ÄúSeriously.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a problem,‚Äù Iris replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLiterally everyone who‚Äôs ever met you would beg to differ.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúUm,‚Äù I say, awkwardly loud. ‚ÄúDel, will you help me with&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean, isn‚Äôt that why things didn‚Äôt work out between you two?‚Äù Del looks
                        between Paige and Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHey, how about we not?‚Äù Paige says with false brightness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh, wait, I remember why,‚Äù Del continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because you‚Äôre selfish as
                        fuck. That seemed to be your main problem. Because she wanted you to be <i
                            class="calibre13">better than you are</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDel,‚Äù Paige says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris just blinks. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del doesn‚Äôt repeat it, but she doesn‚Äôt have to. We all heard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a second, I think Iris might go at Del. Like seriously have a go at her. It
                        would be a bit like a terrier taking on a Great Dane, but I have no doubt that Iris could
                        inflict some damage if she wanted to.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But instead she turns to me, and there‚Äôs color high in her cheeks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou told?‚Äù she says, and her voice is choked. ‚ÄúYou told her?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. And then it registers. Of course it does. I was the only one who heard
                        Paige say that. The only one besides Iris, that is. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt tell, I
                        wouldn‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so full of shit,‚Äù Iris says, and then leaves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My legs move almost of their own volition, carrying me out into the hall after
                        her. She‚Äôs moving swiftly away, and I have to jog to catch up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell, I swear,‚Äù I say, and there‚Äôs desperation to it. My heart is
                        beating faster, and it feels like all the blood is rushing up my neck, up and around my head,
                        every nerve ending suddenly alight with panic, with the way that Iris looked at me in there.
                        Like I‚Äôm the ultimate betrayer. ‚ÄúIris.‚Äù I put a hand on her shoulder to stop her, and she turns,
                        but she wrenches away from me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre15">‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù she says, and even though she‚Äôs crying, her
                        words come out quick, clear, harsh: ‚ÄúI knew it from the start but I didn‚Äôt listen to that voice
                        telling me to not bother with you, because you were nice to me, and I was lonely, and that‚Äôs on
                        me. But being a lying piece of shit? That‚Äôs on you, Claudia.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She didn‚Äôt lay a finger on me, but it hurts like she did, like she laid a punch
                        right to my solar plexus.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äù is all I can say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGo screw yourself,‚Äù Iris replies, and leaves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This time I don‚Äôt follow.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">As I return to the shop, Paige bursts through the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she says, eyes wide and sad. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll talk to her. I‚Äôll
                        tell her the truth.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat truth?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat it was me. I told Del.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt like a broken picture frame&mdash;you can‚Äôt just take the blame for
                        it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut I did. I told her. After Iris and I broke up, I ‚Ä¶ talked to Del about it
                        some, and it helped. I‚Äôll tell Iris. I will.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I take a deep breath. Then I shake my head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, Claudia&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally. It doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù That‚Äôs a lie. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù And another.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I walk past her and into the shop, grab my bag off one of the worktables and
                        ignore Del, who has paused in front of a dress form with Hippolyta‚Äôs wedding dress on it. <i
                            class="calibre13">Worth it, not worth it. Worth it, not worth it.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat was mean,‚Äù I say finally. ‚ÄúAnd really unnecessary.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del doesn‚Äôt reply. Doesn‚Äôt acknowledge that I‚Äôve spoken at all.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I leave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I walk around the Grove for fifteen minutes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It seemed reasonable to storm off, but rationally, I need to be there for
                        rehearsal. I have to do last-minute fixes on the costumes. I have to be on hand to take care of
                        the donkey head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So I go back. And I suffer through the last-minute fixes and rehearsal,
                        standing backstage to claim the donkey head after Bottom has been officially restored to his
                        original self.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When it‚Äôs all over&mdash;late into the evening&mdash;I go home and log into
                        Battle Quest. I start a side quest for a blacksmith in the capital city, journeying out into the
                        Blaze to collect some rare ore from a miner.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-210" class="calibre15">It‚Äôs dark out there in the fields, the middle of the
                        night. At least momentarily.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The Aradanian suns have risen and I‚Äôve gotten the ore by the time my chat
                        window dings.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Gideon Prewitt waves at you</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Viola is positioned next to a hillside just outside the capital city. I‚Äôm all
                        alone, or so it seems, until I toggle my view around and see Gideon Prewitt, now a level-nine
                        notary signore, standing nearby.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Gideon Prewitt strikes a gentlemanly pose</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Gideon Prewitt twirls</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Gideon Prewitt does the Horsenfeld shuffle</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt respond. Viola just stands, stoic, and there‚Äôs no way that Gideon can
                        know that I‚Äôm sad, that I feel inside out and upside down, there‚Äôs no way that he can tell. But
                        the chat window dings again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Gideon Prewitt: you okay?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">On-screen, avatar Gideon Prewitt walks right up to Viola. And it‚Äôs so stupid,
                        I‚Äôm so stupid, but I wish he was here, I wish it was real. I wish I could bury my face in his
                        neck. I want it so bad my fingers twitch on the controller, straining not to make my stupid game
                        character hug his stupid game character so at least some facsimile of it can exist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stay still. Viola stands, motionless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Gideon Prewitt: claude?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When my fingers finally spring into action, it‚Äôs to log off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I set my computer aside and lie on my bed, and I can‚Äôt help but think of the
                        first day of preschool.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I knew that school was a place that Julia went off to every day. Alex had
                        started going, too, and I knew that he liked it&mdash;the coloring and the block corner and the
                        little round tokens you could exchange for treats on special days.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But I wanted to stay home with my mom, who was still just part-time back then,
                        working evenings after my dad got home from work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">On the first day of preschool, my mom held my hand and walked me into the
                        classroom. She got me situated at a table where a couple of kids were doing puzzles and then
                        hung back a bit while I started in on mine. The puzzle was tricky, but I was getting the hang of
                        it&mdash;I almost had it&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I turned around and saw that she wasn‚Äôt there anymore.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I cried and cried and cried when I realized she had left. I cried even as a
                        little girl from one of the other tables came up to me. She was wearing denim shorts and a
                        purple striped T-shirt. Her hair was arranged in little twists, clasped at the ends by plastic
                        flower barrettes in an array of neon colors. The barrettes clicked against one another as she
                        moved toward me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-211" class="calibre15">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gonna come back,‚Äù she said as I hiccupped in
                        between sobs. ‚ÄúYour mama. She‚Äôll come back later. Mrs. Parson said.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her eyes were very solemn. I didn‚Äôt understand solemnity or concern; I couldn‚Äôt
                        define the fact that she was looking at me like I was important. Like I mattered. But it stopped
                        my crying, momentarily.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn‚Äôt know what to say. So I reached out and touched one of her barrettes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her face split into a smile. She reached up and unclipped the barrette, and
                        before I could react, she grabbed a hunk of my hair and tried to clip it in. But it was too
                        much, the barrette wouldn‚Äôt close. So she just pressed it into my hand instead&mdash;a
                        lime-green daisy clip.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I admired it, the perfect flower shape, and then held it out to her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou can keep it,‚Äù Zoe said. And just like that, we were friends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I sit up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And stand and cross over to my dresser, to the jewelry box on top. I slide open
                        one of the tiny drawers, top left. If the jewelry box had a heart, this would be it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pick up the barrette. Clasp it hard and hold my fist against my mouth. I know
                        that it will press a daisy shape into my palm, and I don‚Äôt even care.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I cry hard.</p>

                    <h2>forty-nine</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">I‚Äôm crossing through the Grove on Thursday before the start of dress rehearsal.
                        The leaves on the trees have thinned&mdash;most have fallen in a carpet of yellows and reds and
                        browns&mdash;and I see the figures up ahead before I hear them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs Gideon and Noah, heads bent in conversation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It reminds me of the first day of school&mdash;coming here with Caris and
                        Robbie. Gideon raising his arms in the air like a referee, calling us all over. Asking everyone
                        about their summer like he actually cared.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs too late to turn away when they see me. Gideon waves, tentative compared
                        to that first-day-of-school enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I reach into my pocket to clasp the green daisy barrette that I‚Äôve been
                        carrying around today like a totem. Like it will bring me comfort, or peace of mind, like it
                        will help guard me against Gideon and his cautious smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Except the barrette isn‚Äôt there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I check my other pocket. I turn them both out. I spin around, in case it
                        slipped out just now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But the barrette is nowhere on me, nowhere in sight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I had it in calc this afternoon, I had it at my locker after class, and as I
                        headed over here, I‚Äôm certain I did, mostly certain, fairly certain&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaudia?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Leaves crunch as Gideon and Noah head my way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm frantically scanning the ground when they reach me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Gideon says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI lost something.‚Äù I can‚Äôt keep the panic out of my voice, and it‚Äôs stupid, I
                        know it is, but&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Noah says, brow furrowed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúA hair clip. It‚Äôs green, and it‚Äôs shaped like a flower&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The look they both give me says that my reaction is not proportional to the
                        situation. I shake my head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important. I have to find it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre15">‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll find it,‚Äù Gideon says. ‚ÄúWhen did you last
                        have it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúRight before I got to the Grove. It‚Äôs bright green and plastic, it‚Äôs&mdash;‚Äù I
                        watch as Gideon starts searching in earnest, but Noah is still giving me that look. ‚ÄúI know it
                        sounds stupid, but I need it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nods. ‚ÄúYeah, okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We start retracing my steps back up toward school, but there are so many leaves
                        on the ground, I already know deep down that this is basically a pointless endeavor. But I keep
                        looking anyway.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pull my phone out of my pocket eventually to use the flashlight. But as soon
                        as I click it on, I see texts from my mom and four missed calls.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pause, opening the texts first:</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I read the words again:</p>

                        that are so tiny they look like nothing more than a bundle of blankets. I didn‚Äôt know human
                        beings could ever be that small, could ever be so fragile.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-213" class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet on the ride until I can‚Äôt take the quiet
                        anymore.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMy mom made all these hats,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúBaby hats.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Gideon replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I twist my fingers together in my lap, and I try to focus on anything other
                        than my mom picking out the patterns and comparing yarns, rubbing different skeins against the
                        inside of her wrist in the aisle of a craft store to see what was the softest. The last one she
                        finished was yellow with a little orange flap across the forehead like a duck‚Äôs bill, and when
                        we showed it to her on Skype Julia said it was ‚Äúfricking adorable, Mom, but seriously, the kid
                        only has one head.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd it will always be warm,‚Äù Mom replied.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Out of the corner of my eye I see Gideon glance over at me. And then he looks
                        straight ahead again, but he rests one hand on the console between our seats, palm up. Like an
                        invitation. Like I could take it if I wanted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt hesitate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And it‚Äôs quiet again until I realize how tight I‚Äôm holding on. I ease up but
                        don‚Äôt let go. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He shakes his head. ‚ÄúVic used to hold my hand when she was little, like when
                        she would get shots and stuff? She has this crazy iron grip. When she got her ears pierced in
                        fifth grade, I thought she broke my finger. So I‚Äôm used to it. I don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When we pull up to my house, I have to let go of Gideon‚Äôs hand. I swallow and
                        look out the window, and that‚Äôs when I see someone is sitting on our front stoop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She has her arms wrapped around her knees, her hands pulled into the sleeves of
                        her sweatshirt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I get out of the car before Gideon‚Äôs barely even stopped it, cross the lawn,
                        and hug her hard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She hugs back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAlex texted me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúInside. It was weird so I thought I‚Äôd wait out here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúZoe&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIs that the space prince?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I let go of Zoe and turn. Gideon is hovering awkwardly by the car.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre15">I grab Zoe‚Äôs hand and lead her over. ‚ÄúThis is Gideon.‚Äù I
                        gesture to Zoe. ‚ÄúThis is Zoe, she‚Äôs my best friend.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù he replies, and then it‚Äôs quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWell, I should&mdash;‚Äù Gideon starts, just as Zoe says:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou should&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúStay,‚Äù Zoe says. ‚ÄúYou should stay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Gideon looks torn. ‚ÄúI have to get back for dress rehearsal.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I clap a hand to my head. ‚ÄúRehearsal. Fuck. I didn‚Äôt tell Del&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll talk to her,‚Äù Gideon says and then pauses. ‚ÄúI could ‚Ä¶ I
                        could stay, though,‚Äù he says, looking hesitant. ‚ÄúIf you want.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous. You have to do the show.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI could come back after. I could ‚Ä¶ bring food.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Don‚Äôt worry about it</i> is what I should say. <i
                            class="calibre13">We‚Äôll be fine.</i> Instead I nod. ‚ÄúYes. Yeah. Okay.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù He nods too. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back.‚Äù And then it‚Äôs silent for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Until Zoe says ‚ÄúDrive safe‚Äù next to me, too loud, and I almost jump.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid you forget I was here?‚Äù she says as we watch Gideon pull away from the
                        curb. She pokes me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie. You did. You totally did. You were lost in the space prince‚Äôs
                        majestic eyes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI was not.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve tried to make him laugh, I want to hear that weird chuckle.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúZoe, geez.‚Äù I smile, but it turns into a grimace, and she pulls me into
                        another hug. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared,‚Äù I mumble into her shoulder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her grip on my back tightens slightly. ‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>fifty</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúI would‚Äôve picked you up,‚Äù Alex says when we get inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHave you heard anything new?‚Äù I reply, even though I know he probably hasn‚Äôt.
                        He shakes his head, and it‚Äôs quiet for a moment, me and Zoe in the doorway to the living room,
                        Alex on the couch with his phone at his side. If it‚Äôs good news, my mom might call either of us.
                        But if it‚Äôs bad news, she‚Äôll definitely call him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He has his computer open on his lap. He inherited Julia‚Äôs when she finished
                        college. It‚Äôs seen better days, like mine, but it still runs Battle Quest, and that‚Äôs what
                        matters. ‚ÄúI think I found it,‚Äù he says after a moment, eyes dropping to the screen. ‚ÄúThe gateway
                        to the Lord of Wizard.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI ran a quest for a druid who gave me a scrying stone. But not the normal
                        kind, like the mages get? I only noticed after I was reading up online&mdash;and that map you
                        found in the Blaze? The one I asked for a while back?‚Äù I nod. ‚ÄúI put them together, and it lit
                        up this portal in the outer rim. I think ‚Ä¶ I think it might be it. It‚Äôs not a dungeon we‚Äôve ever
                        played before, it‚Äôs not something anyone‚Äôs mentioned from the last patch.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúShould we go?‚Äù Zoe says, her eyes on me. She hasn‚Äôt looked Alex‚Äôs way once. I
                        wonder briefly if this is how it‚Äôs going to be from here on out between the three of us. Stiff
                        and awkward and so unlike it was before.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúMaybe we should wait for Julia.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex considers it for a moment. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just go check it out. We can come back
                        with her and Mark when they ‚Ä¶ if they want to play again.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There is nothing else to do but wait for news, to sit and ruminate about baby
                        hats.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So we go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe and I get our laptops, and then Viola, Korbinian, and Alex‚Äôs character,
                        Eustace Everfire, are trekking across the Blaze.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was just here, moving through this very same part of the country, with Iris
                        and Gideon. Seeing Alphoneus Centurion. It seems like ages ago.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-215" class="calibre15">We follow Alex‚Äôs charmed map to the outer rim, and it
                        takes us to a large rock formation. As we get closer, I can see the outline of a door within it,
                        emitting a weak glow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Korbinian walks right up to it, presses one gloved hand to the door, and
                        attempts to open it. Nothing happens.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an inscription,‚Äù Zoe says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I toggle the view so I can see closer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Traveler, to enter&mdash;the cardinal touches, the
                            stallion gambols.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a bit as we think, Viola, Korbinian, and Eustace standing
                        motionless, the small strip of light around the door pulsing faintly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly Zoe breathes in sharply. On-screen, Korbinian moves, touching a finger
                        to the door&mdash;top, bottom, and each side. Korbinian steps back, and four symbols alight on
                        the door, one in each spot that Korbinian touched.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCardinal directions,‚Äù Zoe says. ‚ÄúNorth, south, east, west.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We wait.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat about the stallion?‚Äù Alex says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGambol means like, to jump around,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúTo prance.‚Äù I flash on Iris
                        suddenly: <i class="calibre13">That was an SAT word</i>. She and Gideon aren‚Äôt nearly
                        experienced enough with Battle Quest to make it in a boss battle like the one potentially
                        waiting for us behind this door. But part of me wishes they were here with us too. Gideon would
                        have avatar Gideon Prewitt twirling, jumping around, doing the&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHorsenfeld shuffle,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúStallion gambol. Do the Horsenfeld shuffle.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I start Viola off dancing. Eustace and Korbinian join in, and suddenly the door
                        glows bright white and swings open to reveal a dark tunnel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We head inside. The door slams behind us. It‚Äôs pitch black.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly, a booming voice echoes through the tunnel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt; Lord of Wizard: Travelers, are you prepared?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt; Lord of Wizard: To battle the Lord of Wizard, to accept your fate?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt; Lord of Wizard: Are you prepared to sacrifice your soul to the island
                        forever, should you fail?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry, what now?‚Äù Zoe says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù On screen, Eustace Everfire lights up an orb that fills the
                        tunnel with faint light. We‚Äôre alone. But the Lord of Wizard continues to speak.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Lord of Wizard: Will you meet your end head-on?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù I say. Is that why no one‚Äôs
                        talked about this battle? Because if you fail, you have to start over? I look over at Alex. ‚ÄúHe
                        can‚Äôt actually kill our characters, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you die against the Lord of Wizard, you die in real life,‚Äù Alex murmurs,
                        and Zoe huffs a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean? Sacrifice our souls to the island?‚Äù
                        I‚Äôve spent too long building up Viola‚Äôs stats, running her through the different classes, to
                        give her up now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find out,‚Äù Alex says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Lord of Wizard: Do you accept?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We all click yes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs not long before we‚Äôre running from an army of the undead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They started popping up in twos and threes, and at first it was manageable.
                        We‚Äôd slay a few and move forward, farther and farther through the winding tunnels.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But soon they come in larger numbers, slowing us down, and then there are too
                        many to reasonably fight off without the risk of dying, so we start to run. The tunnels narrow
                        and widen and narrow again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe is in the lead. ‚ÄúI think I see a light up ahead.‚Äù Korbinian quickens, Viola
                        and Eustace right behind, advancing on what appears to be an opening, lit beyond by the dancing
                        orange glow of torchlight. I cast a quick look back and see that the undead hordes trailing us
                        have thickened immensely.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôre almost there&mdash;they‚Äôre gaining on us&mdash;we throw ourselves through
                        the opening&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A door swings shut behind us. Torches lining the walls flare brighter,
                        illuminating the single cloaked figure in the middle of the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His back is turned to us, but I know it‚Äôs him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Lord of Wizard: Here, travelers, will you meet your doom.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He turns to us, nothing but darkness beneath the hood of his cloak, except for
                        the gleam of a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A number of the undead detach from the walls of the chamber and surround the
                        Lord of Wizard, forming a protective barrier around him. In order to get to him, we‚Äôll have to
                        go through them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There are just three of us&mdash;with Julia and Mark, maybe, playing healer and
                        doing combat, too, we might make a dent, but as it is, it‚Äôs just Zoe healing, Alex tanking, and
                        me doing damage, trying to strike where I can while Alex draws the attention of the undead
                        soldiers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally we break through the horde and get to the Wizard himself. But as we
                        approach him, the Wizard claps his staff against the ground once, twice, three times, and begins
                        to grow.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-217" class="calibre15">And grow. And grow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNot fair!‚Äù Zoe says. ‚ÄúHe was normal-sized before!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Lord of Wizard: Do you have faith in your abilities, travelers?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Lord of Wizard: Are you prepared to die by your own sword?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The Wizard brings his staff to the ground again, and a burst of electricity
                        sweeps from its base. We barely jump back in time, and as it is, Korbinian is licked by a tail
                        of lightning, and his health bar drops in half.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex and I both launch a series of attacks against the Wizard, Alex pulling
                        back when he can, trying to draw the Wizard‚Äôs attention away from us, but the ring of undead
                        soldiers around him has replenished, and they start to attack as well. The Wizard himself seems
                        to be surrounded by a shield&mdash;any magic I send his way rebounds off him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet among us, just the clicking of our keys as we fight&mdash;on-screen,
                        explosions and bursts of lightning and the Lord of Wizard‚Äôs laugh, rising above it all.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;Lord of Wizard: Are you ready to accept defeat?</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI have an idea,‚Äù Alex says, and suddenly Eustace Everfire glows purple.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you doing? What is that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúA new spell.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Eustace Everfire‚Äôs health bar begins draining rapidly as he absorbs attacks
                        from the surrounding monsters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a switch,‚Äù Alex says. ‚ÄúYou just have to wait to flip it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAlex, you‚Äôre gonna&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúKeep fighting,‚Äù he says, and glances over at me. ‚ÄúYou got this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre out, you‚Äôre out, you might not come back.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou got this,‚Äù he says again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúZoe, stop him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúKeep going!‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOne more push.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Eustace is absorbing the Wizard‚Äôs attacks now, his entire body pulsing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">&gt;The Lord of Wizard: BOW BEFORE ME.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Eustace suddenly glows white and lets out one giant surge of magic aimed at the
                        Wizard. The shield falls momentarily.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù Alex says. ‚ÄúNow!‚Äù Eustace falls to the ground in a crumpled heap, the
                        health bar above his head at just above zero.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt have a moment to waste. I launch a series of attacks. Zoe heals me,
                        adding to the attack when she can.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Together, we fight, giving it everything we‚Äôve got. The Lord of Wizard‚Äôs energy
                        finally, finally drains.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre15">&gt;QUEST COMPLETED.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Alex yells. ‚ÄúFuck yes!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe did it,‚Äù Zoe says, and it‚Äôs almost a question. ‚ÄúWe did it!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We cheer. We yell. We jump around.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Until Alex‚Äôs phone chimes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Still in labor. Probably a few more hours.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And we all sink back down onto the couch.</p>

                    <h2>fifty-one</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">We decide to put off exploring the Island of Souls until we can come back and
                        repeat the battle with Julia and Mark. Instead we watch TV. At least, we‚Äôre all acting like
                        we‚Äôre watching TV, but to me, it barely registers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Eventually, there‚Äôs a knock at the front door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon is standing on the porch, holding a stack of pizza boxes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he says when I open the door. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve called. Is
                        everything&mdash; do you want&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Yes. The pizzas and also him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He hesitates. ‚ÄúI brought Iris,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd I usually drive Noah home, so
                        he‚Äôs here, too. I could, uh, I could just leave the food, or I could drop them off and then come
                        back if you want&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúEveryone can come in. You and them and the pizzas and you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His lips quirk, an almost-smile. He waves to the car, and Noah and Iris get
                        out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris has her arms folded, head down. She stops inside the door, even as Noah
                        and Gideon go ahead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me from before,‚Äù I hear Gideon say inside. ‚ÄúAnd this is Noah Edelman.
                        He‚Äôs one of the best people I know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your sister?‚Äù Iris says, studiously examining the doorframe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúStill in labor. No news yet.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nods. ‚ÄúI can ‚Ä¶ call a ride. I just wanted to see if you were okay. If you
                        needed anything. And ‚Ä¶ I wanted to say I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù She meets my gaze. ‚ÄúI know that you didn‚Äôt
                        tell Del. Paige talked to me. And even if she hadn‚Äôt, I know you wouldn‚Äôt, I know that. I just‚Ä¶‚Äù
                        She shakes her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like, my mom, she had this dog when I was little, this really
                        ugly Affenpinscher? She had gotten him before I was born. And he was old, and if you came up
                        behind him and he didn‚Äôt hear you, he would just snap at you, it didn‚Äôt matter who it was, he
                        just ‚Ä¶ reacted, and sometimes, I just ‚Ä¶ react. I‚Äôm not like you and Paige; when it comes to
                        people, the only thing I‚Äôm good at is saying shitty things to them, and I ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre15">She straightens up. ‚ÄúAnyway, I hope your sister‚Äôs okay,
                        and I hope the baby is okay. Just ‚Ä¶ let me know if there‚Äôs anything I can do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She turns to go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWait. Do you want pizza?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike ‚Ä¶ to take with me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike, to eat here, with us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris blinks. ‚ÄúYou forgive me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJust like that?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that easy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSometimes. Sometimes not.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut this time?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that easy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We spread the pizzas out on the table in the living room, and I go into the
                        kitchen for plates. Gideon and Noah follow me in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThere are drinks in the fridge,‚Äù I say, and then stop with one hand on the
                        cabinet door and check my phone again. Nothing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah goes into the fridge, but Gideon just leans against the counter next to me
                        as I start pulling some dishes down from the cabinet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI was born six weeks early, you know,‚Äù he says quietly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Noah says. ‚ÄúAnd just look at him.‚Äù He closes the fridge. ‚ÄúSeriously,
                        look at him.‚Äù Gideon straightens up and begins doing a model walk across the room and into the
                        hall, swinging his arms, fingers extended, kicking out each foot with his head held high.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLook at those legs,‚Äù Noah says. ‚ÄúLook at that bone structure. Look at those
                        eyes, you could get fucking lost in them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou need GoogleMaps to find your way out of my eyes,‚Äù Gideon says, executing
                        an elaborate turn before catwalking back. ‚ÄúOr at least a comparable navigation app.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile a little.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We eat and watch TV, and there‚Äôs not a whole lot of talking in general, but
                        it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ nice. It‚Äôs comforting.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris and Gideon fall asleep eventually&mdash;Iris in my dad‚Äôs lounger, Gideon
                        on the floor at her feet. Zoe and Alex are sitting on either side of me on the couch. I get up
                        at one point to show Noah where the bathroom is, and when I come back they‚Äôre as far apart from
                        each other as the couch will allow, their eyes fixed on the TV as Gideon snores softly.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre15">This isn‚Äôt what I want. But it‚Äôs not even about what I
                        want, is it? It‚Äôs about what they want and how I got in the middle of that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt with you guys,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this. Get up.‚Äù I look pointedly at
                        them both. ‚ÄúSeriously.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Zoe says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to go talk.‚Äù I grab Alex‚Äôs arm and pull him up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFeelings and stuff,‚Äù I say, pulling Zoe to her feet too. ‚ÄúAll the gushy stuff
                        deep down inside. Don‚Äôt hold back. Just never tell me about it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Neither of them move.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGo upstairs,‚Äù I prompt. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come back until it‚Äôs all sorted out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally&mdash;finally&mdash;they look at each other. Zoe smiles, the slightest
                        bit. Alex nods.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And then they go upstairs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I sink down on the couch, rest the crook of my elbow over my eyes. The pressure
                        feels good.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Footsteps shuffle back in after a couple minutes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWant some more pizza?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head, uncovering my eyes and looking up at Noah.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We haven‚Äôt talked much since our conversation outside the theater at Danforth.
                        Since <i class="calibre13">you don‚Äôt know him at all.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He gestures to the spot next to me. ‚ÄúCan I?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He sits and then stretches out his legs on the coffee table in front of us. For
                        a little while it‚Äôs quiet, save the TV and Gideon‚Äôs snores.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan I tell you something about me that not a lot of people know?‚Äù he says
                        eventually.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhen I was eight, I really wanted to be on <i class="calibre13">America‚Äôs Got
                            Talent</i>. Like I had an act and everything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat was your act?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúTap dancing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou can tap dance?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm terrible. My mom took an audition video of me and told me she sent it
                        in, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it never saw the light of day, thank God.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile a little.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you want to know something else?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI have epilepsy.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúI wish I could blame it for my bad tap dancing,
                        but you can have epilepsy and still be a great tap dancer; the two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. I
                        just genuinely sucked at tap dancing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre15">I look over at him. His eyes are fixed on the ceiling, a
                        small smile on his lips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like a secret or anything. It just ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, it doesn‚Äôt come up
                        until it comes up, you know? I should‚Äôve said something at Triple F&mdash;we must‚Äôve seemed
                        nuts&mdash;but that‚Äôs why Gideon‚Ä¶‚Äù He shrugs, his smile fading. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why. I want to get my
                        license, but my parents won‚Äôt let me try until I‚Äôve been seizure-free for six months. And ‚Ä¶ I
                        haven‚Äôt been. So.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I say. It feels insufficient, but I‚Äôm not sure what else to say. <i
                            class="calibre13">I‚Äôm sorry</i> comes to mind, but that doesn‚Äôt feel right. I get the
                        impression Noah doesn‚Äôt want me to be sorry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a moment. And then he goes on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you remember that party? When he refused to go in because of the cups?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I say, and my eyes dart over to where Gideon is lying on the floor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, when he sleeps, he‚Äôs dead to the world,‚Äù Noah says, and then: ‚ÄúIt
                        wasn‚Äôt because of the cups. It was because they had a strobe, and he was afraid it would set me
                        off. I don‚Äôt even ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre called photosensitive seizures? I‚Äôve never even had one triggered by
                        that. But he‚Äôs so ‚Ä¶ paranoid.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs mean. He‚Äôs cautious. He‚Äôs
                        annoyingly cautious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy did he lie about the cups, then? Why wouldn‚Äôt he just say?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôd rather look like an asshole than embarrass me in any way. Not
                        that I‚Äôd even be embarrassed, but that‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ how he is.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúThough that‚Äôs not to say
                        that every time Gideon looks like an asshole, it‚Äôs because he thinks he‚Äôs keeping me from
                        embarrassment. He picks those shirts himself, after all.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI like the shirts,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf course you do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat triggers yours, then? If not lights and stuff.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He shrugs. ‚ÄúLots of things. If I don‚Äôt take my meds properly, or if I‚Äôm tired,
                        or stressed. Alcohol can do it, too,‚Äù he adds with a little smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look over at him. ‚ÄúThe RumChata Incident?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He meets my eyes, briefly, and grins. ‚ÄúYeah. The first and only time we ever
                        drank. Gideon didn‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt know it could cause it. I did. It was Christmas break
                        freshman year and we stole a bottle of RumChata from my parents‚Äô cabinet and got hammered in my
                        room.‚Ä¶ When I woke up, I had the worst grand mal I‚Äôve ever had. I fell off the bed, hit my head
                        pretty bad on the nightstand.‚Äù He pushes his hair back from his forehead with one hand,
                        revealing a scar that disappears into his hairline. ‚ÄúIt scared Gideon a lot,‚Äù he says, quieter,
                        letting his hair flop back down. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been annoyingly cautious ever since.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-222" class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe cares a lot about you,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm telling you. Maybe he changes obsessions every week,
                        you know, maybe he likes lots of different things, but the important stuff ‚Ä¶ the people he cares
                        about ‚Ä¶ he cares <i class="calibre13">so much</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A pause. ‚ÄúAfter the RumChata Incident, when I got back home from the hospital,
                        he came over and we were sitting outside&mdash;Ellie, my little sister, she still had this play
                        set, we were sitting on the swings&mdash;and he looked at me and he said that he wished it was
                        him.‚Äù He shakes his head. ‚ÄúI said, you know, it‚Äôs not gonna change anything, it‚Äôs not gonna hold
                        me back at all. And he said he knew that, he knew that nothing could, but that he still wished
                        he could do that for me. If we could switch ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôd switch in a second, no question. Because‚Ä¶‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause he loves me,‚Äù Noah says, and lets out a breath of laughter. ‚ÄúWhat a
                        dick.‚Äù A small smile. ‚ÄúSometimes I wish there were like a combination of a hug and a punch
                        ‚Äôcause that‚Äôs what I would do to him. Like I want to punch-hug him, but also keep anything bad
                        from ever happening to him. Because I ‚Ä¶ Like, that‚Äôs how I love him, too. If it were him, I‚Äôd
                        wish it were me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can‚Äôt imagine loving someone that much, but at the same time, I know exactly
                        how it feels, because that‚Äôs how I feel about Zoe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And fuck it, that‚Äôs how I feel about Iris, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I got upset when you said that stuff about him. I didn‚Äôt mean to be
                        a jerk about it. I just ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like people thinking things about him that aren‚Äôt true. Not
                        when he‚Äôs literally the best person I know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head. ‚ÄúI was being a jerk.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A colossal jerk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a while after that. Finally I glance over at Noah again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIf you could have a superpower, what would it be?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSuper spit,‚Äù he replies without a moment‚Äôs hesitation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat&mdash;that‚Äôs not even a thing. Why do you guys think that‚Äôs a thing?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He smiles.</p>

                    <h2>fifty-two</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">We wake up Iris and Gideon eventually. It‚Äôs late, and a school night, and
                        they‚Äôve got to be ready for opening night tomorrow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI could stay here,‚Äù Gideon says, all sleep-soft, rubbing his eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Can you drive though?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get drunk off pizza.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile. ‚ÄúBut are you too tired?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He shakes his head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They gather their coats and shoes. I thank them for the pizza. They make me
                        promise to text as soon as I hear something. I say I will, even though I know I won‚Äôt text until
                        the morning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Noah pauses inside the door. ‚ÄúThis was one of the weirder parties I‚Äôve ever
                        been to,‚Äù he says, and I manage a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watch them go. Iris waves from the backseat as Gideon pulls away from the
                        curb.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I go upstairs and get ready for bed, even though I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll fall asleep.
                        The door to Alex‚Äôs room is still closed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm climbing into bed when there‚Äôs a light knock at my door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe sticks her head in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúCan I sleep over?‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pause, the covers halfway drawn up. ‚ÄúSure. I mean. You and Alex can do
                        whatever you want.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She makes a face. ‚ÄúI meant in here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I find her some pajamas, and then we get in bed and lie awake.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDid you fix it?‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks over at me, nods. ‚ÄúI love him, Claude.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I was a dick.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She turns her gaze to the ceiling. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve told you before. I was scared.
                        And not just of how you‚Äôd react, but ‚Ä¶ of things being different. Like, if you didn‚Äôt know, then
                        I could pretend that everything could stay the way it is.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-223" class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDo you remember that first night, right when we started volunteering?‚Äù she
                        says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI always thought that maybe there was something a little wrong with me,
                        because I didn‚Äôt feel it like you did. I felt sad, obviously, like I felt really sorry for the
                        kids and their families and I wanted to help, but when we had that talk about it, I remember
                        thinking ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòClaudia feels it so much more than I do.‚Äô You just care so much, you know? And
                        sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm cut off from stuff because my first instinct is like, ‚Äòokay, how can
                        we fix this, what can we do to make it better.‚Äô But your first instinct is just like, ‚Äòhow must
                        the other person be feeling?‚Äô It cuts so close with you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good thing,‚Äù I murmur.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, it is. I think it is. I, like, admire it. And I think ‚Ä¶ You know, maybe
                        we‚Äôre friends because you‚Äôre the way you are, and I‚Äôm the way I am, and I‚Äôm just ‚Ä¶ really
                        fucking scared, Claude, of everything being different.‚Äù She lets out a breath. ‚ÄúI told myself
                        that I didn‚Äôt say anything because I was worried about how you‚Äôd take it. But really I‚Äôm worried
                        about me. About things changing so much and you not being around to feel things for me, you
                        know? Like what am I gonna do then?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôll always be here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut you won‚Äôt. You‚Äôre gonna go to school, and you‚Äôre gonna do great. I already
                        know because you have ‚Ä¶ good friends,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou found really good ones.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I did. I got lucky, somehow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI meant here for you,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow is it even a question?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúEven if me and Alex break up?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúEven if we don‚Äôt?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get so drunk at your wedding.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She laughs.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs late into the night, and I‚Äôve actually almost drifted off to sleep when I
                        hear footsteps in the hall and someone pushes my bedroom door open.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alex pads across the room and hands the phone to me, the light glowing
                        blue-white through the darkness. I can‚Äôt read his expression as I take it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe‚Äôs still asleep. I get up and go into the hall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMama?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah, honey. I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs so late. We‚Äôre all here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She tells me that Julia delivered the baby. They‚Äôve taken him to the NICU. He
                        weighs three pounds, nine ounces, and his name is Jack.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I take a deep breath and let it out. And then another&mdash;breathing in sweet
                        relief. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good name,‚Äù I say finally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúJulia wants to talk to you.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs going to be okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs on oxygen, but he‚Äôs breathing okay; they said he doesn‚Äôt need a

                    <p class="calibre15">I do remember that. We got eggs and waited for them to hatch in a plastic

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHow are you feeling? Are you okay?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI fucked up my first act as a mom,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI evicted him from my uterus

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúClaude,‚Äù she says, but it‚Äôs with a hint of a laugh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBefore you know it, he‚Äôs going to be twenty-five and you‚Äôre going to be

                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh great, that‚Äôs what you envision for my son?‚Äù she says with a laugh&mdash;
                        in earnest this time, but it shifts partway through. ‚ÄúMy son,‚Äù she repeats. ‚ÄúMy baby,‚Äù and she‚Äôs

                    <p class="calibre15">Silence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all going to be good,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be so, so good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She doesn‚Äôt speak for a while.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna come up there tomorrow.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, you can‚Äôt,‚Äù she says, her voice still hoarse. ‚ÄúYour play, Claude. You‚Äôve
                        worked so hard.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI really haven‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, you have to go. You and Alex can drive on Saturday.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, really&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI had to hear you talk about it all this time. You‚Äôre not missing that show.
                        One day won‚Äôt make a difference.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôll be bigger by Saturday.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she says. I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôll cry again, so I go on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúSay bye to Mom. I‚Äôll call in the morning.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLove you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLove you too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I give Alex his phone back, and we both stand in the dimness of the hallway,
                        quiet between us. And then I step forward and rest my forehead against his shoulder. He pats me
                        on the back, a few bro thumps, before letting his hand rest there for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù he says, and I nod even though I‚Äôm not sure what he means, whether
                        it‚Äôs everything with Julia&mdash;<i class="calibre13">she‚Äôs okay, the baby‚Äôs okay</i>&mdash;or
                        the whole thing between us (<i class="calibre13">I would‚Äôve picked you up</i>). Maybe a little
                        of both.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-225" class="calibre15">I step back and look at my brother, who really would‚Äôve
                        picked me up tonight. Who broke up with Zoe even though neither of them wanted to. Who risked
                        death for me to fight the Lord of Wizard, even after everything I said to him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I want to say I‚Äôm sorry. I want to say I know how terrible I was, how selfish.
                        But in this moment all I can get out is, ‚ÄúDo you remember Spooky Tree?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looks surprised. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThank you for kicking Spooky Tree.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">One corner of his mouth lifts up. ‚ÄúClaude, I would kick a thousand Spooky Trees
                        for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. ‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù My throat feels tight. ‚ÄúI mean, maybe not Spooky Tree exactly,
                        but, like, a different, similarly scary tree.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI might take you up on that one day,‚Äù he says with a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>fifty-four</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">I text everyone about Jack in the morning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">AUNT CLAUDIA REALNESS, Gideon texts back, almost instantaneously.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I say good-bye to Zoe, talk to my mom again before I go to school, and then the
                        day passes by somehow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris and I grab something to eat after school and take it back to campus before
                        the call for the show. We eat in the hall outside the shop, and she tells me about the final
                        dress rehearsal last night&mdash;a few dropped lines, a couple prop mishaps, but mostly okay.
                        I‚Äôve just seen bits and pieces so far, but I‚Äôm excited to see the whole show, even if I have to
                        watch part of it from backstage, on donkey-head duty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNoah was great,‚Äù Iris says. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so freaking funny. And Gideon‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, he‚Äôs really good, too.‚Äù She pulls on the straw in her drink,
                        lifting it up and down a few times so it makes that obnoxious squeaking sound.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I say, just as she says:</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre we ever going to talk about it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe whole Homecoming debacle.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAre we calling it a debacle?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI call ‚Äôem like I see ‚Äôem.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt speak.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you really turn him down? You‚Äôre obviously obsessed with each other.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWe are not ob&mdash;look, okay. I just. It won‚Äôt work out. I want it to, but I
                        just know that it won‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBecause.‚Äù The truth: ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm the kind of person you feel regular about.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-226" class="calibre15">Iris just looks at me. ‚ÄúHow can you say that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And when I don‚Äôt respond, she says it again: ‚ÄúHow can you say that? Seriously.
                        Because some dickbag said it to you one time? Look at me. Look at my face, Claudia, and, like,
                        listen closely to the words that are coming from it, okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I look at Iris‚Äôs face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou have a best friend and siblings who love you. Gideon looks at you like you
                        fucking hung the moon, and I&mdash;you have&mdash;‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt make sense, but Iris‚Äôs voice
                        catches at that, her eyes shine all of a sudden. ‚ÄúI give a shit about you, too, you know. We all
                        do. And so to say that ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre saying we‚Äôre wrong. Do you think we‚Äôre all wrong? All
                        of us? To care about you like that? To ‚Ä¶ value you, the way we do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I blink. The way she says ‚Äúvalue‚Äù makes it sounds strikingly interchangeable
                        with ‚Äúlove.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúNot ‚Ä¶ not when you put it like that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she says fiercely, and then nods. ‚ÄúOkay. So. If you don‚Äôt want to date
                        Gideon because you don‚Äôt like him, then obviously don‚Äôt date him. But if you‚Äôre not with him
                        because you think, like, you‚Äôre not <i class="calibre13">worthy of love</i> or some bullshit
                        like that, then reevaluate the situation with that in mind, okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGood.‚Äù She looks away, fussing with her straw again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think that just because you said a bunch of nice stuff about me, I won‚Äôt
                        poke you for making that sound,‚Äù I say when I can speak again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI would expect nothing less,‚Äù Iris replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The door to the studio opens then, and Del comes out into the hall.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI am.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúEveryone okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got work to do.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>fifty-five</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">The costumes have all been moved upstairs to the dressing rooms, so that‚Äôs where
                        Caris, Del, and I end up, running around and making sure everyone has everything they need. A
                        junior named Alyssa Peters does makeup for the fairies; apparently she and Del worked together
                        on creating distinct ‚Äúlooks‚Äù for each of them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I‚Äôm helping Kaitlyn tie up the ribbons on her top&mdash;it‚Äôs sort of a
                        deconstructed corset&mdash;while Iris is having her makeup done. I look up in the mirror as
                        Alyssa applies a thick glitter under Iris‚Äôs eyes, running down onto her cheeks. Iris sticks her
                        tongue out at me when she notices me looking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del comes by when Alyssa is finishing with Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúKaitlyn‚Äôs next,‚Äù she tells Alyssa as Iris gets up out of the chair. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs
                        with your hair?‚Äù she says to Iris.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We‚Äôve made a number of different hairpieces for the fairies. Mostly old
                        jewelry&mdash;pins and brooches and parts of necklaces&mdash;attached to bobby pins and
                        barrettes, but also random things attached to them as well, like plastic figures and Matchbox
                        cars, halves of old compacts and fake flowers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Iris says, touching her hair. She‚Äôs got one clip in, a gold-painted
                        plastic army man attached.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIris. Seriously?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou said our hair was self-guided.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del gestures to the open chair next to Kaitlyn‚Äôs. ‚ÄúSit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris sits, and Del begins threading ribbons through her hair and putting
                        assorted clips in here and there. When she‚Äôs finished, Iris considers herself in the mirror.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt looks nice,‚Äù she says finally. ‚ÄúEverything ‚Ä¶ looks good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Del gives a curt nod. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then she heads off to assist elsewhere.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou look really pretty,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúKeep it in your pants,‚Äù Iris replies, but I catch her smile in the mirror as
                        she turns away.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Lena catches me when I step out of the dressing room. She‚Äôs all done up
                        as Helena, who looks positively bookish compared to Lena‚Äôs usual out-of-school look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lena‚Äôs holding her script, and for a second I panic&mdash;she‚Äôs got her lines
                        down, she has to have them by now&mdash;but before I can say anything, she flips the script open
                        and points to it emphatically.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI figured it out,‚Äù she says, eyes bright.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúFigured what out?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThe whole Demetrius thing. Remember when we talked about it? How it‚Äôs messed
                        up that he‚Äôs still under a spell at the end? Well, I thought about it, and I was listening to
                        Aimee and Gideon doing their scene yesterday, and I figured it out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre <i class="calibre13">different</i> spells. The one Oberon places on
                        Titania, he says, <i class="calibre13">the next thing then she, waking, looks upon ‚Ä¶ she shall
                            pursue it with the soul of love</i>. Then Puck charms Lysander, and it‚Äôs kind of like that,
                        he says‚Äù&mdash;she flips through her script, finds the spot&mdash;‚Äú<i class="calibre13">When
                            thou wak‚Äôst, let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid.</i> You explained that one to
                        Aimee, remember?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut Oberon charms Demetrius.‚Äù She flips through the script again and then
                        starts to read: <i class="calibre13">‚ÄúFlower of this purple dye, hit with Cupid‚Äôs archery, sink
                            in apple of his eye, when his love he doth espy, let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of
                            the sky. When thou wak‚Äôst, if she be by, beg of her for remedy.‚Äù</i> She looks at me
                        expectantly. ‚ÄúDifferent spells, right?‚Äù she says when I don‚Äôt speak. ‚ÄúThe ones for Titania and
                        Lysander are like, love whatever thing you happen to look at next. It could be legit anything.
                        Lysander could‚Äôve fallen in love with a ‚Ä¶ soda can or something, and it would have been fucking
                        hilarious. But the one for Demetrius is specific&mdash;<i class="calibre13">when his love he
                            doth espy</i>. When he sees the person he <i class="calibre13">already loves.</i> He loves
                        Helena for real, he‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ forgotten it. He even says it at the end ‚Ä¶ his feelings for Hermia,
                        you know, just ‚Ä¶ melted away. With the spell, Oberon just ‚Ä¶ brought out what he already felt for
                        her. Reminded him of it.‚Äù She looks up at me. ‚ÄúDid I figure it out? Did I do Shakespeare right?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI mean ‚Ä¶ yeah.‚Äù I never thought of it like that. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She beams at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a really good tutor.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, that was ‚Ä¶ all you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know, right? But still.‚Äù Before I can react, she throws her arms around me
                        in a crushing hug. ‚ÄúThis is gonna be so fun!‚Äù And then she‚Äôs off.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-228" class="calibre15">Iris appears at my side. ‚ÄúWhat was that about?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLena gets Shakespeare,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Before Iris can reply, Sudha emerges from one of the smaller dressing rooms for
                        the leads. When she spots us, she heads over, a look of concern on her face. ‚ÄúHey, so, no big
                        deal, but Paige is kind of freaking out a little&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Iris says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúAnd she won‚Äôt talk to anyone, but maybe ‚Ä¶ maybe she‚Äôd talk to you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">We find Paige in the dressing room, sitting slumped in a chair, full Titania
                        outfit on. Her hair is flowing down her back, shot through with gold and silver ribbons. Several
                        strands of pearls have been twisted together into a circlet atop her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looks up when we enter, eyes red, hands knotted in her lap. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do
                        it,‚Äù she says miserably when she sees Iris. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt know what to say, but Iris just crosses over and kneels in front of
                        Paige‚Äôs chair. ‚ÄúYou can,‚Äù she says calmly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù Paige repeats.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut you have to. Literally everyone is counting on you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This is not the tactic I would‚Äôve employed. I probably would‚Äôve gone with
                        something more like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to do great!‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôve got this!‚Äù But Iris just
                        rests her hands on Paige‚Äôs knees.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLook at me. Look.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige looks up, blinking glittery eyelids. Her mascara is still holding, even
                        as tears stream down her face. Alyssa Peters really is a makeup wizard.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI know it seems scary,‚Äù Iris says calmly. ‚ÄúAnd I know that Claudia has just
                        been waiting for the chance for you to screw up so she can throw on a tutu and go out there and
                        make out with Gideon in front of Mr. Palmer and everyone‚Äôs parents and Jesus.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù I start, but Paige just gives a watery laugh, and Iris goes
                        on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut she can‚Äôt do what you can do. Nobody can. So we all need you to go out
                        there and do it. You are ‚Ä¶ so good at this. You‚Äôre ‚Ä¶ fucking ‚Ä¶ incandescent up there. Okay? And
                        you know me, you know I won‚Äôt lie to make someone feel better. So you know this is the absolute
                        truth.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paige nods. And then reaches to cup Iris‚Äôs face, pulls her in, and kisses her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Paige says, pulling away a fraction of an inch. ‚ÄúFor what I said
                        when we broke up. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Iris shakes her head. ‚ÄúYou were right.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou were. I‚Äôm selfish, and I need to be better. I do. And I want to be better.
                        I want to be someone that you could love.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou are someone that I love.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúBut I want to be someone worthy of that,‚Äù Iris says, and there‚Äôs a fierceness
                        to it that pricks unexpected tears in my eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou are,‚Äù Paige says so softly, and then kisses her again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I turn toward the mirrors and pick up a tube of lipstick on the counter just to
                        have something to do.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou are very unnecessary right now, Claudia,‚Äù Iris says when they break apart
                        again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just be outside.‚Äù</p>

                    <h2>fifty-six</h2>
                    <p class="calibre1">Paige goes on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watch parts of the show that are broadcast on TV in the greenroom and sneak
                        backstage to watch other parts from the wings. I wait with the donkey head and manage to get it
                        on Noah in record time before his big reveal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs raucous backstage at intermission. Crowded and hectic and wonderful.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I linger in the wings for the start of the second half.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The lights go up on Gideon onstage, wondering what creature it is that Titania
                        has fallen in love with. And then Aimee runs on and declares, <i class="calibre13">‚ÄúMy mistress
                            with a monster is in love!‚Äù</i> and the show is back in action.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Someone steps up next to me. It‚Äôs Iris. She smiles. Grabs my hand, leans her
                        head against my shoulder. We stand like that and watch the show.</p>
                    <p class="calibre7">* * *</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs chaos backstage after the curtain call, but chaos of the best sort.
                        Everyone‚Äôs hugging and congratulating and celebrating. I spot Gideon cutting through the crowd,
                        heading toward me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou were so good,‚Äù I say when he reaches me. ‚ÄúReally, really good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His cheeks are flushed, like he‚Äôs been exercising, which I guess he kind of
                        has&mdash;running around with Aimee, wreaking magical havoc all evening. ‚ÄúI have something for
                        you,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd also thank you. And also I have something for you. Wait here. Or in the
                        hall? No, wait here, I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And he takes off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I congratulate a few people, and Caris comes and gives me a hug, and then
                        Gideon returns.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúMaybe out here?‚Äù he says, and then promptly turns and heads away, out the side
                        door and into the hallway, which is deserted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He turns to me when we get out there. He looks in disarray, his necklaces
                        askew, his hair wild.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-230" class="calibre15">‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he says, and extends a hand toward me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Resting on his palm is the lime-green daisy barrette.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I don‚Äôt take it. I‚Äôm frozen on the spot. Frozen at the sight of Gideon Prewitt,
                        space prince, standing in front of me, looking bright and disheveled and tentatively proud.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt was so crazy before the show, I didn‚Äôt get to see you, and I didn‚Äôt want
                        to&mdash;like, in front of everyone, but we went looking through the Grove, we found
                        it&mdash;Noah found it, I‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt lie. He said I should say I found it but really it
                        was him, and it seemed‚Ä¶‚Äù He falters, his hand still extended. ‚ÄúSeemed important to you, and ‚Ä¶ I
                        mean, this is it, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">This is it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nod. Take the barrette and put it in my pocket. And then I take his hand,
                        rest it against my cheek, and turn my head to press my lips against his palm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He just stares.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I loosen my grip, embarrassed suddenly. ‚ÄúIs it&mdash;do you not want&mdash;‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúNo, I want,‚Äù he says quickly, moving closer. ‚ÄúI want.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Me too</i> is what I should say. <i class="calibre13">Me
                            too, ME TOO</i>, but words don‚Äôt come out, I just look up at Gideon‚Äôs face, at the smile
                        blooming there, with his unfathomable dimples and his eyes that you need GoogleMaps to find your
                        way out of, warm and bright and shining.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">You were so silly, denying yourself this,</i> I think. <i
                            class="calibre13">You were so foolish. Thank God you know better now.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His smile dims momentarily. ‚ÄúBut I thought ‚Ä¶ you said that you didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shake my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His brow wrinkles the slightest bit, the softest concern. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù And I fight the urge to sway even closer, because I want him to see my
                        face, I want him to know, for certain, when I say this: ‚ÄúBefore, I was just ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean what
                        I said at Homecoming. I‚Äôm so sorry. That I said it. That I let you think that. I was just
                        scared.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOf what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI guess, just‚Ä¶‚Äù I shake my head. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs hard to know if something‚Äôs
                        for real? It‚Äôs hard to believe it, even if you want it to be real. Even if you want it so badly.
                        Sometimes it seems ‚Ä¶ safer, you know. Not to risk it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nods, and I‚Äôm not sure if he understands, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm making any sense
                        at all, but he looks at me and there‚Äôs barely any space between us now. ‚ÄúSo you do ‚Ä¶ like me
                        like that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-231" class="calibre15">‚ÄúSo if I kissed you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">One corner of his mouth ticks up, the dimple reappearing. ‚ÄúI should probably ‚Ä¶
                        do that, then.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOr we could keep talking about it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He grins full-out now, and then we kiss.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Just once, soft and light. His lips part just the slightest bit, and when we
                        break apart, he lets out a breath. I think for a second he‚Äôs going to say something, but then he
                        brings one hand to my waist and kisses me again, fuller, deeper, longer. I thread my fingers
                        through his hair, and I can hear a faint buzzing from inside the auditorium, the muted sounds of
                        many voices talking at once, but I can‚Äôt hardly remember what they‚Äôre all doing there, can‚Äôt
                        hardly think of anything but this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre13">Awesome</i> sells it short. Any positive adjective I can
                        possibly think of is not good enough, not potent enough, not worthy to describe it. It‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶
                        something else.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When we finally separate again, I rest my forehead against Gideon‚Äôs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúYou know what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúHm?‚Äù He sounds a little dazed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat had everything on my must-have list,‚Äù I say, and then drop down to a
                        whisper: ‚ÄúLuxury. Affordable. Industry standard.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Gideon lets out an unholy snort, and I dissolve into giggles. I bury my face in
                        the crook of his neck, and we both laugh, holding each other tight.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúThanks for coming to the show,‚Äù I say. It‚Äôs late, and Zoe and I are in bed. My
                        back is resting against the headboard, my knees pulled up to my chest. I feel wide-awake, like I
                        just got a hundred hours‚Äô sleep.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have missed it. A-plus costumes. Stupendous. And the show was good,
                        too, I guess.‚Äù She cuddles Mr. English closer and then looks up at me. ‚ÄúBut before we get into
                        the whos and whats of the fancy school theater scene, I need to know what it was like to kiss
                        the space prince. I need ‚Ä¶ a full-length analysis.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I consider it for a moment. I could consider it for a lot of moments, if left
                        unchecked. Not just the kiss in the hall outside the auditorium, but the ones in the parking lot
                        afterward and at the cast party and on the street outside after the cast party. Gideon with his
                        cheeks flushed and his eyes bright, close enough that he was blurry, saying <i
                            class="calibre13">I like you, you know. Like so much, so much, so much&mdash;</i>each one
                        punctuated by a kiss to a different place.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike going into an instance,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúLike ‚Ä¶ existing apart from everything
                        else.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe just looks at me for a second and then gets out of bed and begins circling
                        the room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúThat was so sappy, I have to walk it off.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not <i class="calibre13">sappy</i>, you asked me to&mdash;you said I
                        should&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She‚Äôs hopping around now, flapping her hands. ‚ÄúWalking it off.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I throw an arm over my eyes and laugh. ‚ÄúSorry. Yeah. It‚Äôs silly. But&mdash;‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also sweet,‚Äù she says, crawling back on the bed. ‚ÄúReally sweet, Claude.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It‚Äôs quiet for a bit, both of us just thinking. Until I finally turn back to
                        Zoe and say, ‚ÄúI have to tell you something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOh shit. Are you and Gideon running away into the woods to get married?
                        Because I just saw a play about the dangers of that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre15">I grin. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWhat is it then?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI really like TION. Like, I kind of love them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Zoe smiles. ‚ÄúI sort of got that impression.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúLike, not even a little bit ironically. I genuinely love them. If one of them
                        needed a kidney and I was a match, I would genuinely give them my kidney.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúWould you give me a kidney?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúI‚Äôd give you both kidneys.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She wraps an arm around me. Rests her head against mine for a moment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tomorrow, we‚Äôre going to see Julia and Mark, and I‚Äôll meet Jack for the first
                        time. The nurse will tell us that <i class="calibre13">the tallest oaks were once the smallest
                            acorns</i>, and Julia will smile at her but make a face at me when the nurse leaves. <i
                            class="calibre13">My son the acorn</i>, she‚Äôll say, and laugh and wipe her eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The show will go on again that night and be every bit as wonderful. And I‚Äôll
                        call Gideon when it‚Äôs over and talk to him long after everyone has fallen asleep, the phone
                        growing warm against my ear. As we say good night, I will want to say <i class="calibre13">I
                            love you</i>. I won‚Äôt say it. But just the thought of it will keep me awake long after. The
                        best kind of awake, the purest caffeine pumping through your veins, where you never want to stop
                        feeling what you‚Äôre feeling, can‚Äôt bear the thought of interrupting it, even with sleep.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But right now, it‚Äôs me and Zoe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI know you have pictures of TION somewhere. Walk me through
                        it. Give me a crash course.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I smile, reaching for my phone. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start from the beginning.‚Äù</p>
