                <h3>Chapter 30</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">My phone chirps. A text from Bảo. My parents are finally sitting down with friends
                    who’d stopped by at the tail end of service hours. The men brought out Heineken, signaling that
                    it’ll be a bit longer until we get to leave the restaurant. Evie is busy with cleanup tasks, though
                    from what I can see, she’s catching up with the line cooks who looked after us when we were younger,
                    and the less senior servers are taking care of clearing the tables. I sneak out, promising myself
                    ten minutes of my own time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The air is cool enough for me to wear my jacket outside. I use the lamplights to
                    guide me away from the restaurant, to the small park usually populated by skateboarders and people
                    exercising outside. Bảo’s there, sitting on a graffiti-ridden bench. He sets a Styrofoam container on
                    the bench and stands when he sees me. His smile is weary, a perfect reflection of mine. He kisses me.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Peace offering,” he says, handing me a container. I laugh and hand him my own,
                    which I had hidden behind my back. Inside Bảo’s box, he’d packed away a small slice of <i
                        class="calibre5">bánh xèo,</i> while I gave him egg rolls nicked from the kitchen. We sit there,
                    eating food cooked by our family’s respective enemy. I wish I could say I understood why their food
                    is considered a threat, a reason for my dad’s competitiveness when it comes to them, but I can’t
                    really taste the difference, even if the <i class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> is good.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Do you think it’s possible that our parents actually know each other?” Bảo asks.
                    “Like, actually interacted with each other? Maybe way before us. Vietnam, or sometime after their
                    escapes?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Wouldn’t they have said something, though?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre12">“Come on, it wouldn’t be unusual for them to hold back a few
                    things from us.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I think about the comments my mom and dad have made about his family. <i
                        class="calibre5">Have I missed signs?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What makes you say that?” I ask.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“My mom mentioned something about your mom’s cooking. About her <i
                        class="calibre5">bánh xèo</i> not being good, but she sounded like she <i
                        class="calibre5">knew.</i> Like she’s had it before.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Okay… ?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How much do we really know? Like Chef Lê said, there’s stu that they don’t tell us
                    because it isn’t relevant to us.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So, what, you want to ask your parents about us?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Nothing too direct. Nothing to raise suspicion. You okay?” Hands together, he runs
                    his thumb over my hand. I wonder if he knows what he’s doing. “It’s a lot, I know.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I don’t want to run away again.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“For now,” I say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“My mom just texted. She’s wondering where I’ve gone off to; they’re heading home.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I know,” I sigh. I hate thinking that the moments we spend together are only
                    temporary. That, when we get back to our separate restaurants, we’ll need to pretend that our lives
                    have no bearing on each other. When it’s the opposite.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He takes my hand and we start walking back. I imagine a time when we don’t have to
                    hold hands in the dark, when we can visit each other on lunch breaks without having to nd a secluded
                    park.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We’ll find another moment,” Bảo says, reading my expression. “We still haven’t had a
                    first date yet.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“If you think about it, haven’t we’ve gone on many dates already&mdash;between the
                    restaurants that we went to and our meetings in the art room?” I say, even though the word “date”
                    causes my stomach to tumble.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We stand at the intersection between Larkin and Sylvester, knowing we’ll need to
                    let go. By day, the plaza is packed with cars, but the parking lot is empty now. A neon sign saying
                    <span class="calibre13">CLOSED</span> burns brightly in the dark, casting a metallic sheen against
                    Bảo’s face. It’s silent save for grasshoppers hiding in nearby bushes.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre12">“This is going to be different. Let’s go somewhere where I can
                    hold your hand like this.” He squeezes my hand. “Brush aside your hair when it falls in front of
                    your eyes.” Like now. “Kiss you.” He leans in, capturing my lips.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Our first date will be ours alone,” he declares.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">On a Saturday, my parents and I attend a two-part wedding: the traditional
                    Vietnamese ceremony and the American reception&mdash;all in one day. The bride, Fay, is the oldest
                    granddaughter of Bác Xuân. I’ve talked to Fay a couple of times, our circles of family and friends
                    overlapping because of our business, and liked her. Rather than being involved in the food business,
                    she went to dental school and later opened up her own practice in southern California. Her partner
                    is her soon-to-be husband.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Attending a wedding ceremony means I’ll need to squeeze into my <i
                        class="calibre5">áo dài</i>, which grows tighter each passing year. It means seeing strangers
                    who know everything about me through information shared over various phone calls, store errands, and
                    house get-togethers. It also means there’s a high possibility of me sitting at the kids’ tables at
                    the reception&mdash;with the actual ages ranging from two to college students. Since Evie’s back at
                    college, I’ll be the only teenager at the table, but for the rst time ever, it won’t matter.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">This wedding is an opportunity.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mind latched on to Bảo’s suggestion as I fell asleep last night. Is it possible
                    that there’s more to our families’ feud besides our competitive restaurants? Is there something else
                    that might have driven them apart and made our families this way?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I can’t ask my parents outright; I’m not even sure there’s a way to ask them
                    subtly.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But, as all Vietnamese know, information gets around. At least one person has to
                    know the truth. In my parents’ network, there’s only one viable person who might know more about my
                    family&mdash;and Bảo’s. The best connection that we have so far is Bác Xuân, Fay’s grandfather, who
                    gave my mom a chance with the restaurant. And who helped most of the businesses around here,
                    including Bảo’s family restaurant.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-197" class="calibre12">Mẹ and I are getting ready in her bedroom. She’s just put on
                    her <i class="calibre5">áo dài</i>, a yellow-and-white oral pattern adorning it from top to bottom.
                    She needs me to hook together the sides so that skin there doesn’t show.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Apparently Fay and her husband are not going to last, my mom con des in me. They’d
                    picked the wrong dates, didn’t consult the right calendar, or something like that. I don’t think
                    those things actually have a real bearing on the outcome of their marriage, but my mom&mdash;and her
                    friends&mdash;certainly do.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The ceremony at Fay’s house proceeds smoothly. First the men and the women from
                    each side of the family exchange gifts in red tin baskets covered by red velvet. It’s a way of the
                    husband asking permission from the bride’s family to see her. Both families line up at the shrine,
                    also decorated in red. Fay, radiant in her traditional red <i class="calibre5">áo dài</i>, emerges
                    from upstairs, her arm looped through her already crying mother’s. When she joins her soon-to-be
                    husband, Dũng, who’s wearing the traditional blue <i class="calibre5">áo dài</i> for men, the image
                    of them is striking. They’re the most colorful people in the room, and their happiness only makes
                    them glow brighter.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I imagine the murmurs from the crowd fade when Fay and Dũng face each other to
                    exchange vows. Dũng, so nervous, bumbles his way through his speech, his words earnest and sincere,
                    and Fay reaches out for his hand when he pauses, holding back tears. We’re all smiling by the end of
                    the ceremony.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Later, the wedding transitions into a modern American wedding. The <i
                        class="calibre5">áo dài</i> disappear&mdash;though Fay’s mom opts out of changing&mdash;and we
                    move for the American ceremony to a Catholic church, the reception to follow in its courtyard right
                    after. I’ve changed into a periwinkle dress that stops above my knees.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I do my best to avoid the women in Fay’s family. They like to tease. They think, <i
                        class="calibre5">Well, there’s one Vietnamese woman off the market! Let’s see who else has
                        potential</i>, so they crowd the young ones and joke about their boyfriends. I can just imagine
                    the fury on my parents’ faces if I were to ever answer the question honestly. That me and Bảo are
                    finally together.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre12">I try to fight back my smile when I get the question for the
                    fourth time tonight. I guess it feels less tedious when you actually have a perfect answer.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Fay and her husband, Dũng, couldn’t look any happier. Probably both from the relief
                    of finally seeing their wedding go o without a hitch and from the actual idea that they’re just
                    starting a new life together.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">By now, food and lots of alcohol have sated the guests. The elderly ones sit
                    clumped off, chattering away about past and present grievances. My parents are sitting with Fay’s
                    parents, chatting. The younger generation are tearing up the floor, moving along to the American music blasting from the speakers. They’re</p>
                <p class="calibre1">heedless of the expressions of shock, and some amusement, from their parents and
                    family members watching. But there’s also a few braver older Vietnamese guests who’ve joined the
                    oor, and I think I can pass the night away just watching it happen. The strobe lights are blinding,
                    disorienting. I almost forget about Bác Xuân, until I see him a couple tables away, seated in a
                    wheelchair on the edge of the dance oor. My heart wrings at the sight of him; it’s been so many
                    years since I’ve seen him in person.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I escape the flailing elbow of a seven-year-old to my right and make my way over. “<i
                        class="calibre5">Thưa</i>, Bác Xuân.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bác Xuân looks up slowly and reveals a nearly toothless smile. “Ah, <i
                        class="calibre5">cháu</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Do you remember me?” I ask cautiously in Vietnamese.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Of course. Liên Phạm’s daughter,” he replies. “You look just like her now. What a
                    beautiful young woman you’ve become.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I laugh, sitting down across from him. Age spots outline his cheek. His hands
                    sandwich mine, trembling faintly. There’s a glossiness in his eyes that I mostly see in my family’s
                    elderly customers. They’re past the point of worrying, their lives already fulfilled. I think it’s a
                    look of satisfaction, or I hope it is.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How are you doing? What are you doing in school? And where is your sister
                    &mdash;you have a sister, don’t you? I remember she was very smart. And you still draw?” He seems
                    happy to talk to someone, finally. I smile with relief, just glad that he remembers me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Evie’s away at UC Davis, studying biology.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ah!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“And I still draw. I’m a painter, in fact.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre12">“So I can see.” He gestures to my hands. I really thought I
                    washed them well, but I missed a spot on my pinkie finger. <i class="calibre5">“Giống y hệt dì của
                        cháu,”</i> he mutters, amused.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“My aunt?” I ask in English, jostled by the comparison. Then I remember she visited
                    him when she was over here. “Dì Vàng, you mean.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Of course. Ever since she was little, she would have her hands in something messy.
                    Mud. Then clay. Sculpting was her true passion.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The disorientation comes back and now it has nothing to do with the lights. “You
                    knew my mom and aunt back in Vietnam?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I lived just a few houses down from them. In Nha Trang.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I lean back into my seat. That’s why my aunt had been so familiar with him on her
                    last visit. They weren’t just meeting; they were <i class="calibre5">reuniting</i>. I glance past
                    Bác Xuân, feeling as if the ground shifted underneath me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Back in Nha Trang. <i class="calibre5">Before me.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Bảo’s right. There’s more to the story than we’ve been
                        given.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, your mother and your aunt! They were inseparable, especially after your
                    grandparents passed. It was always interesting seeing your mother act like the older sister.” Bác
                    Xuân shifts in his wheelchair, his pillow slipping sideways. I get up and x it quickly, earning a
                    pat on the shoulder. “Thank you. The community, just like here, was important in our neighborhood.
                    Individually we didn’t have much, but together, we had everything we would need, even as the <i
                        class="calibre5">Cộng sản</i> were starting to take everything we had. We looked out for each
                    other. Mẹ, your mother and aunt, the Lês, especially after the fall of Saigon.” He pauses.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ah, forgive me. She’s no longer a Lê; she’s now a Nguyễn.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Nguyễn.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It was a miracle that we all found each other again when we made it over here. It
                    took longer than we all imagined.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Nguyễn as in Bảo Nguyễn?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Bác Xuân,” I say, interrupting him midsentence, “by Nguyễn and by ‘she,’ do you
                    mean the woman who owns the restaurant across from ours?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Of course, who else? She runs her restaurant like a true entrepreneur. Just like
                    her own mother. I thought that by encouraging her and your mother to see each other again&mdash;the
                    restaurants facing each other&mdash;they would be able to move on from the past.” He shakes his
                    head. “Ah, terrible what happened.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-200" class="calibre12">“What happened?” I ask immediately, though I wish I hadn’t,
                    because it signals a change in Bác’s expression. He actually looks uncomfortable now.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You don’t know?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I shake my head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ah, well. It is not my story to tell. If my wife were here”&mdash;Bác Xuân’s wife
                    had passed before I remember meeting him&mdash;“she would tell you everything, but I don’t think I
                    can. I don’t think I have any right to.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I won’t tell my parents, I swear. I’ve been wondering about the other family, why
                    they’ve never spoken to each other. Why they seem to hate each other.” I place a hand on his arm,
                    but he only pats it again, this time with sympathy.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He chews on his lip, deep in con ict. “We went through many things to get here, <i
                        class="calibre5">cháu</i>. Things that we do not speak of because it might pain us too much.
                    Show some respect. It will all come out in due time.” He nods to another person over my shoulder,
                    then wheels himself away, oblivious to the thoughts roiling inside me.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">I stalk the room, deep in thought, the wedding fading in the background. My mom and
                    Ba have now included Bác in their conversation with Fay’s parents. Mẹ is smiling and Ba throws back
                    his head, laughing. They’re both red from the wine at the table. Looking at the group, I wouldn’t
                    have been able to see the shared history with Bác; I always assumed they’d met in California. But
                    there’s a story between them&mdash;and between my mom and Bảo’s mom.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The bride and groom do their rounds around the room, trailed by a red-eyed, pale
                    photographer who looks like he doesn’t know what sleeping means. When they get to my table, where
                    I’m now sitting, the kids all hold up their fourth glasses of soda that their parents, under the dim
                    lighting, and amid the noise of celebration, don’t know they’re having.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Fay spots me and gives me a quick hug. I push the revelation from Bác Xuân to the
                    back of my mind. She introduces me to Dũng. Up close, dressed in a chic white dress and crisp
                    black-and-white suit, they really do look like models.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre12">“How’d you guys meet?” I ask.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">At my question, Fay and Dũng exchange one look and a small smile, full of meaning,
                    full of secrets only the two of them can know. “Well, we were in college and in the library cramming
                    like usual.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It was the rst time I stepped into the library, actually,” Dũng jokes.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We checked out books at the same time. Mine was a chemistry book.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Dũng glances down in mock shame. “And mine was a manga book.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Something I’ll never stop teasing you about.” Her husband pulls her close,
                    planting a quick kiss on her forehead.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Our first date, because we were poor college students, was actually on campus.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">First date</i>. Bảo said we’d have one soon, but will that all
                    change when I tell him what I’ve found out? That the history between our families goes even further
                    back than we realized, to a time that neither of us belonged to?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Turns out Dũng had been the one to ask her out first. “We had a picnic on the quad,
                    then walked around campus, ended up at the library, where I made dinner in one of the study rooms.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">Fay gazes up at Dũng with a soft smile, so tender I feel like I’m intruding. “And
                    did your parents approve of you two?” Then, the DJ decides to turn up the music, drowning out most,
                    if not all, of my question. In Vietnamese, he asks if everyone is having fun.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Fay leans over, asking me to repeat myself. The photographer snaps a photo of us. I
                    shake my head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“This wedding is so much fun. Congrats!”</p>
