                <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">I regret many things in life, and I know I‚Äôll regret many more at the rate I‚Äôm
                    going. But my number-one regret <i class="calibre5">now</i> is taking journalism as my elective.
                    Astronomy, the easiest class any senior can take, was already filled up. Vi·ªát was lucky enough to get
                    in. I thought journalism was the second easiest. Since freshman year, <i
                        class="calibre5">Hawkview</i>‚Äôs been filled with crossword puzzles, sudoku games, and What‚Äôs the
                    Difference? games, and always ended up stu ed in toilets or cafeteria trash cans.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Then Allison Dale became the editor in chief. I swear she‚Äôs tougher than any sta
                    member at the <i class="calibre5">Los Angeles Times</i>. She‚Äôs not even <i class="calibre5">in</i>
                    this class&mdash;she has study hall last period, which means she can technically leave school early,
                    but doesn‚Äôt. Even though this is our rst journalism class, Allison‚Äôs already expecting us to chase
                    news stories from things like the chess team embezzling money from their joint fundraiser with the
                    checkers team&mdash;how Allison sni ed that lead out, I‚Äôm not even sure.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The adviser, Ben Rowan, should step in more often, but he seems more like a glorified babysitter. Rowan lets Allison run everything on the newspaper. He‚Äôs the kind of guy who looks
                    like he says ‚Äúsorry‚Äù a lot.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre at the tail end of our editorial meeting about assignment statuses. I take
                    the back seat at this meeting and try not to fall asleep, since it‚Äôs the end of the school day. But
                    a part of me is still recovering from being accosted by theater nerds at the club fair during lunch
                    period. Traumatic. They were demonstrating some circle game in the quad, but to me, it looked like
                    they were trying to summon demons. Other clubs were less intimidating. Apparently there‚Äôs a new
                    TikTok club? I even managed to dodge the Vietnamese Student Association.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre12">The president, Kelly Tran, still hasn‚Äôt forgiven me for
                    oversleeping and missing one Saturday service day during sophomore year. Actually, it was three.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The newspaper room used to be an art room, so the walls have posters about
                    journalism ethics and one blow-up portrait of a younger Woodward and Bernstein posing
                    together&mdash;not sure where that came from&mdash;but also a deep sink with an annoying drip and
                    leftover jugs of neon green and yellow paint from last semester. Macs surround the perimeter of the
                    room, all asleep. I‚Äôm basically silent because I don‚Äôt have anything to show. I forgot my article
                    about upcoming school eld trips.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Kind of.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The truth is, I started to write it. I really did. I‚Äôd talked to the people Allison
                    told me to seek out: the bus drivers, the teachers, and some random students that she found
                    somewhere, and I jotted down everything they had to say&mdash; nothing interesting, of course.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But the moment I started to type them out during the last class, my words stopped
                    making sense. I remember thinking in that moment: <i class="calibre5">What‚Äôs the</i> point<i
                        class="calibre5">? Will anyone read this?</i> Then my words and sentences froze onscreen until
                    nothing was coming out, and I was stuck trying to nd a way to string them together into something
                    remotely reasonable.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Meanwhile, everyone around me was zoned in, typing without pause, putting their
                    stories into those ‚Äúpyramids‚Äù or whatever that Rowan had taught us when we rst started classes.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">So I say that I ‚Äúforgot‚Äù my article, and Rowan just sighs&mdash;</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Did he just write</i> Loser <i class="calibre5">on his pad?</i>
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">Honestly, I don‚Äôt know where Allison gets her energy from. What does she eat? What
                    did her parents <i class="calibre5">do</i> to her? She stands at the center of the desks, which are
                    ush against each other in a perfect square. She‚Äôs more like a lion at the zoo looking out at
                    gawkers. Her hair is in a braid. I think of Katniss Everdeen.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She squints at me. Of course she knows that I lied, that I actually hate writing.
                    Why isn‚Äôt she saying anything? I squirm. I see her at school with Linh in the hallways. What if Linh
                    talks about me or my family&mdash;and what stories has she heard? Maybe she and the rest of the Mais
                    throw darts at pictures of us. That could explain why Allison looks like she‚Äôs devising a way to
                    meticulously murder me and stash my body.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre12">‚ÄúFine. Since you don‚Äôt have anything to write about, I‚Äôm
                    putting you on proofreading duty. Do you have an <i class="calibre5">AP Stylebook</i>?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I shake my head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Smack</i>. Allison tosses me a tome that lands on my desk.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Fingerprints smear the glossy front cover. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I mumble. Awesome. All I‚Äôve
                    ever edited was our restaurant menu where the letter <i class="calibre5">s</i> mysteriously dropped
                    from plural nouns. I just added them back in if I thought they looked weird.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Finally, Allison‚Äôs focus shifts to another kid named Ernie, who smells like
                    wintergreen gum even though he never chews gum. He fiddles with his round glasses that are down to his
                    nose. Looking at him makes me feel anxious.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúErnie, you‚Äôre two days late with the article on the recycling scandal. Where is
                    it?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMr. Allen hasn‚Äôt gotten back to me.‚Äù From what I remember, Mr. Allen, the marine
                    biology teacher, was caught putting trash into his recycling bin&mdash;by Allison herself. That‚Äôs a
                    ‚Äúscandal,‚Äù apparently.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Allison sighs. ‚ÄúDid you talk to him?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI e-mailed him.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI want you to chase him, okay?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúO-okay,‚Äù he stutters.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWait for his class to let out. Show him that I have proof that he broke the
                    rules.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHang on, Allison, you saved the contents of a <i class="calibre5">recycling
                        bin</i>?‚Äù Rowan interjects.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She looks confused. ‚ÄúYes, why?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Is she for real?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Rowan starts laughing but he hides it behind a cough. ‚ÄúGood. A journalist always
                    needs to back up their claims.‚Äù He shakes his sleeve up to show his wristwatch. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we finish
                    the meeting now and get right into it? B·∫£o, here‚Äôs something for you to start proofreading. Try to
                    nish it.‚Äù He o ers me a manila folder, which I get up and take.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-25" class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Try?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Asshole.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">We still have more than a half hour left and Rowan doesn‚Äôt think I can get through
                    a ve-hundred-word article. Oblivious to the insult, he retreats into his o ce abutting the newsroom.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">Allison pushes away a desk with her hip, creating an exit. She pulls aside Luigi,
                    the managing editor, so she can come up with a way to ll what used to be the comics section.
                    Apparently the comics artist showed up to one class, was given an assignment by Allison, and then
                    switched over to graphic design class.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I dive into Allison‚Äôs article about bullying issues and how our statistics compare
                    to nationwide statistics. She knows how to write, knows when she‚Äôs said enough, knows when to punch
                    the details. She‚Äôs good. She quotes Hal, the janitor who‚Äôs one of the main advocates for stronger
                    anti-bullying policies because he sees it happening all the time in the hallways, and Allison writes
                    him so well that it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs right there in the room, leaning against his mop, a watchful eye on
                    bullies.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I only x a few commas and start a new paragraph when one of them looks too long. At
                    the last sentence, though, I stop. I read the sentence over and over again and it just feels‚Ä¶ weird
                    to me. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, so I let my pen linger there, a red dot bleeding through the page.
                    But still, it‚Äôs one word. One word won‚Äôt ruin a piece. And Allison‚Äôs probably not going to like the
                    fact that I‚Äôm questioning&mdash;even if it‚Äôs a small bit&mdash;her article.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The hallway bell dismisses us, thankfully. Allison is yelling out the next deadline
                    for articles. When she walks past me, I hand back her article.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really good.‚Äù Then I‚Äôm free, but not really, since I have work.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWait.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I turn.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying.‚Äù She peers at the paper‚Ä¶ at the red dot that I left. ‚ÄúYou hesitated
                    here. Why?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs unnerving to see a girl my age use the same withering glance as my mom.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat do you mean, you don‚Äôt know?‚Äù she demands.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-26" class="calibre12">Now she‚Äôs annoying me. I snatch the paper back and stab at the
                    paper. ‚ÄúMaybe cut this word and replace it with an adjective. I just think you need a stronger one.
                    Plus the word is repeated earlier in the article.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A long pause falls between us. I swear I hear the clock ticking. <i
                        class="calibre5">Did I just say that?</i> ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Allison says. She looks like she‚Äôs trying
                    not to grimace.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I grab my things. My adrenaline‚Äôs pumping, like I just nished a mile. I feel
                    good&mdash;being right about something for once.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm the only one left in the room, so I leave‚Ä¶ before running into someone.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù a girl says.</p>
