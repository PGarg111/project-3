                <h3>Chapter 15</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">My phone buzzes as a text comes in. I lift my head from the pillow, my bleary eyes
                    searching for my alarm clock, which tells me the time is eight thirty. Who‚Äôs texting me <i
                        class="calibre5">now</i>? Despite having the uncanny ability to wake up early&mdash;probably
                    drilled in by his parents, who took him on morning delivery routes all his life&mdash; Vi·ªát‚Äôs never
                    the one to text rst; he only responds to them, three days too late. The only other person who texts
                    me consistently is M·∫π, through Ba, and if she wanted me to actually wake up, she wouldn‚Äôt be this
                    discreet.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Nothing is more efficient at waking you from a dead sleep&mdash;while also drawing
                    out an involuntary, undignified high-pitched scream&mdash;than a Vietnamese mother bursting through
                    the door without warning.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I grapple for my phone and squint down at my screen.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">hey! it‚Äôs linh. i got your number from
                            ali.</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh. Last night‚Äôs events trickle through my hazy mind. Boba. Our walk. Partners.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">I sit up immediately.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">sorry to bother you so
                            early.</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Should I tell her I don‚Äôt recall ever giving Ali my phone number&mdash;and part of
                    me is perplexed at how she managed that? Another time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">no worries! i‚Äôm up anyway.</b></span>
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">The bubbles appear. An exclamation point! <span class="calibre13"><b
                            class="calibre16">are you an early riser, too?</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">yeah</b></span> <i
                        class="calibre5">&mdash;</i>I start typing, then change my mind. Why would I want to lie about
                    that? <span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">only when my mom‚Äôs threatening my

                <p class="calibre12">I grow more awake with each word. We‚Äôre doing this! We‚Äôre making plans, together!
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">totally.</b></span> My thumb hovers
                    over my next sentence. <span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">can‚Äôt wait!</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bubbles appear. Those damn bubbles.</p>
                <p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000074.jpg" alt="" class="calibre17" /></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now I can go back to sleep.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs nearing ten when I finally wake up again. Strangely my mom hasn‚Äôt barreled in to
                    scream at me. When I go down still in my sweats and T-shirt, I see my parents sitting at the table,
                    like they‚Äôve convened for a meeting. They‚Äôre already dressed.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not working?‚Äù I ask, fighting past a big yawn.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going in the afternoon. But we thought we‚Äôd eat out today.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We never eat out. Which can only mean: We‚Äôre going on a spying mission.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt remember when it started, but this isn‚Äôt the rst time we‚Äôve gone to a
                    competing restaurant to see if it‚Äôs really any competition to ours. Only my parents would do this.
                    Really. Because they‚Äôre weird and obsessed, and they like to bring me into their odd hobbies. And
                    maybe, in an odd way, it‚Äôs their attempt to compromise. I‚Äôd always wanted to eat out: McDonald‚Äôs.
                    KFC. Red Robin. When I begged and begged, my mom‚Äôs reply was always the same. That it was a waste of
                    money and&mdash;</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-92" class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúI can make that. And I can make it even
                        better!‚Äù</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">So far, my parents have managed not to bicker over the GPS and we haven‚Äôt gotten
                    lost yet. That tells me Ba probably did advance research.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnh, slow down,‚Äù my mom says. She‚Äôs in the passenger seat, death-gripping the
                    handlebar just over her head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I look at the meter. Forty- ve miles per hour.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you hear about the place?‚Äù I ask my parents, resigned to my fate.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOne of our customers mentioned it in passing,‚Äù M·∫π says. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt worry: That
                    customer is loyal to us.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh, I was</i> so <i class="calibre5">worried.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">We pull into the parking lot of a plaza. The restaurant‚Äôs surrounded by upscale
                    jewelry stores and ‚Äúelite‚Äù nail salons, and that con rms&mdash;at least to me&mdash; that the
                    restaurant won‚Äôt be legit. It‚Äôs all too‚Ä¶ new. Too shiny. Where are the errant shopping bags rolling
                    along with the breeze? Discarded rinds from clementines or lychees?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">This is what happens when we step inside ‚Äúphotastic.‚Äù Purposely all lowercase.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Tr·ªùi ƒê·∫•t</i>,‚Äù my mom mutters rst. Usually it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúOh my
                    god,‚Äù but in this case it means, <i class="calibre5">What shit is this?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Everything in the restaurant is white: the walls, the tiles, the tables, and
                    chairs.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Even the host is white, wearing a T-shirt printed with a poorly drawn <span
                        class="calibre13">B√ÅNH</span> <span class="calibre13">M√å</span>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Where‚Äôs the shrine? What kind of Vietnamese restaurant doesn‚Äôt have a shrine?
                    Where‚Äôs the red? And yellow? Fake flowers? The floor that‚Äôs seen better days?</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúChao, Bac!‚Äù</i> says the host, missing the tones completely.
                    He has the audacity to bow. ‚ÄúTable for three?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Dumbstruck, my parents nod. Even though the waiter‚Äôs annoying me, I almost laugh at
                    my parents being speechless for once.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Not for long, at least.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúA white waiter?‚Äù M·∫π hisses after we get our menus. We sit in the center at a round
                    table that Ba moves around to see if it‚Äôs lopsided. It‚Äôs not, which, to me, makes this place even
                    more inauthentic. ‚ÄúSpeaking horrible Vietnamese, too.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe can always turn around,‚Äù I say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ba says firmly and calmly, pushing a menu to me and M·∫π. ‚ÄúThis is competition.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBarely!‚Äù my mom protests.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He overrides her. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see why that customer is talking to you about this place.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">We fall silent when the waiter&mdash;John, because of course&mdash;returns again.
                    He asks if we‚Äôre ready to order and Ba <i class="calibre5">actually</i> pulls out a list of menu
                    items and reads them off.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">See: research.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">When the confusion dawns on John‚Äôs face, my stomach drops.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sir. Can you repeat that?‚Äù John looks to me, like I‚Äôm expected to
                    translate for Ba. I look away from him, wanting to prolong his misery. We get this a lot when we go
                    out to non-Vietnamese places&mdash;and maybe this is why we don‚Äôt go out often. Obviously, my dad‚Äôs
                    accent gives him away. He wasn‚Äôt born here like me. But even though I understand him perfectly,
                    sometimes he gets nervous&mdash;but doesn‚Äôt want to say so&mdash;and he speaks quickly. When I was a
                    kid &mdash;bowl-cut me, let‚Äôs just say&mdash;it was embarrassing. Maybe it was the look others gave
                    him, or the visible discomfort in my parents.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now I‚Äôm just annoyed by people like John.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba clears his throat, sits up straighter in his seat. ‚ÄúCo ee. For the three of us.‚Äù
                    He slows his words as he relays the rest.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, yes, sorry.‚Äù The red in the waiter‚Äôs ears&mdash;now he‚Äôs
                    embarrassed&mdash;fades while he jots down the order.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The time waiting for our food consists of my mom and dad‚Äôs airing their complaints
                    against the place. Seems like we‚Äôre the only Vietnamese family here. The lights are too bright. They
                    gave us ‚Äúorganic‚Äù <i class="calibre5">c√† ph√™ s·ªØa ƒë√°</i> that was already served in a glass with ice.
                    Real Vietnamese restaurants make the customers do their own work. The only concession is
                    good-looking waiters&mdash;one, as my mom points out, resembles a K-pop star.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Then the food comes. Turns out, even a kid who didn‚Äôt grow up in a restaurant could
                    tell this wasn‚Äôt any legit Vietnamese restaurant. General atmosphere aside, the kitchen was only
                    doing a poor imitation of the Vi·ªát food I recognize. The <i class="calibre5">c∆°m chi√™n</i> doesn‚Äôt
                    have Chinese sausage&mdash;what kind of fried rice dish is this? Other crimes include oversalting
                    the ph·ªü and not crisping up the</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre15">sh enough.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">D·ªü ·∫πc!</i>‚Äù my mother says, a look of disgust on her face as
                    she sorts through the mushy sh. She‚Äôd already removed the bones and they slid o suspiciously
                    cleanly. If it were really done well, the bones would refuse to come o , and you‚Äôd have no choice
                    but to use a hand and chopstick pair to remove them.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo doubt, this restaurant will close within a few months,‚Äù Ba finally says, pushing
                    away his unfinished plate. I repeat: unfinished.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs text about our rst assignment comes to mind. I ask my parents if I could
                    duck out of my shift early next week. And then the interrogation happens.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI have a newspaper assignment.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNewspaper? When?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJust this year. I‚Äôm writing food reviews.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou?‚Äù my parents ask, simultaneously stunned and incredulous.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I answer exasperatedly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something I started doing.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou are writing about food?‚Äù Ba asks for confirmation.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe does eat like Ba,‚Äù M·∫π mutters, still staring at me. ‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Because Linh‚Äôs going to do it too</i>. Not the best answer to
                    give. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs something to do. I thought you‚Äôd be more excited that I‚Äôm doing, you know,
                    something.‚Äù Using my chopsticks, I stu a bite of white rice in my mouth, trying to act casual. Too
                    <i class="calibre5">ng·∫£o</i>. Mushy.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWriting‚Ä¶ You never said you liked it,‚Äù my mom says.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJust because I never talked about it doesn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt like it.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou did like reading dictionaries as a kid,‚Äù Ba concedes. Turning to my mom, his
                    tone shifts to a joking one. ‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs seeing his girlfriend.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">M·∫π catches on, her preoccupation flying away. ‚ÄúHa! Like that would happen.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFunny, guys. Funny. Girls like me!‚Äù I decide to play along. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs at least one
                    girl in each class who likes me. Kelly Tran. Fiona Su. Cindy Jackson.‚Äù The idea of these girls
                    liking me sends my parents laughing. Even I‚Äôm joining in. Me and Kelly, the girl who despises me for
                    avoiding VSA duties like the plague?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre12">Later, I won‚Äôt be able to explain why I said what I said next.
                    Maybe it‚Äôs a slip of the tongue, or because it‚Äôs a notion even more ridiculous than Kelly, Fiona, or
                    Cindy having a crush on me. Right after Cindy, Linh‚Äôs name slips through my lips.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A dark expression crosses my mom‚Äôs face, like clouds engulfing the sun. ‚ÄúLinh Mai?‚Äù
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">There‚Äôs a dangerous tone in her question, and I immediately retreat. ‚ÄúJust kidding.
                    I‚Äôve never talked to her in my life.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI mean, she‚Äôs, like, really weird. Like, really, <i class="calibre5">really</i>
                    weird. No one likes her at school,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúAnd she smells!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Acting: not my career path. My parents continue glaring at me stonily, the playful
                    mood from before gone. ‚ÄúSeriously, I‚Äôm not seeing anyone. I really am on assignment for the
                    newspaper.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">This causes my mother to lean back, shoulders relaxing.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A different waiter has come back&mdash;mixed, Vietnamese and white, maybe. Her grin
                    falters when she notices my mom‚Äôs fury.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCan I get you anything else, <i class="calibre5">c√¥</i>?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom softens her expression, musters a smile. Maybe she‚Äôs consoled in seeing
                    another Vietnamese person in the room. ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôre ready.‚Äù She cracks open the menu again. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs
                    try the dessert.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5">All the guys here have perfect hair.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">That‚Äôs my rst observation as I walk into the restaurant that Ali had assigned us.
                    The host disarms me with his bright smile as he greets me in Japanese. Average height, he‚Äôs still
                    made tiny by the large wooden desk that he stands behind. The divider‚Äôs just low enough to let me
                    see the waiters walking around, their polished hair&mdash;many of them with the hair of a Silicon
                    Valley guy post-startup phase. Many immaculate man-buns, which the host also has. I‚Äôd look
                    ridiculous if I tried wearing my hair like that.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre12">Linh hasn‚Äôt arrived yet, and in various hand gestures, I let
                    the host know that I‚Äôll wait for a few seconds. Looking up: stalactites&mdash;thin wooden structures
                    jutting down from the ceiling, painted to mimic the top parts of northern Japanese hemlocks.
                    Somewhere in my research about this place, I remember seeing that the chef is from Kyushu, specifically Fukuoka. Maybe this art was inspired by his home. I sneak my notepad from my back jeans
                    pocket&mdash;Ali forced it on me, saying it‚Äôd make me look more ‚Äúlegit.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I turn to the mirrors functioning as walls. Strands of hair still stick out no
                    matter how much gel I use. I‚Äôm so preoccupied that I don‚Äôt notice Linh sneaking up on me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She arches an eyebrow. ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ hair,‚Äù I manage to articulate.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her mouth moves like she‚Äôs fighting words back. Or a smile. ‚ÄúIt looks ne.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We let the host know that we‚Äôre from La Quinta, and as Ali promised, the restaurant
                    was expecting us. Ken, the host, leads us past the dividers. While the waiting room transports you
                    to a different height, the main dining room brings you back to the ground, literally. The oor takes
                    on the cool colors of a modern city; the walls, the outlines of high-rise buildings, adorned and
                    labeled with the sleekness of kanji. Japanese pop music brings an intimate, personal vibe that calms
                    me immediately. It reminds me of seeing out the last customers for the day, of the feeling right
                    before I throw myself into bed.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The other diners are mostly Asian&mdash;a good sign&mdash;and aged young. We don‚Äôt
                    recognize anyone, which makes sense since it‚Äôs a city away. We get seated, and I sneak a look at
                    Linh smiling and nodding at the waitress who swooped in. Linh asks about the artwork, sparking life
                    into the waitress‚Äôs eyes. Maybe she‚Äôs an artist, too. I take down parts of the conversation: her
                    uncle‚Äôs the chef and yes, he wanted the restaurant decor to be an homage to his home island.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe were just fixated on the idea that art can say so much about family history.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI totally understand! I‚Äôm working on something similar.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre12">I make a note to ask about that. When the waitress leaves,
                    though, we‚Äôre alone, forced to look at each other, and suddenly my ability to speak has retreated
                    somewhere else. Our time at the boba shop might as well have been a dream. I resist the urge to
                    straighten the bottle of soy sauce between us, just to do <i class="calibre5">something</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been taking notes already?‚Äù Linh nods at the notepad next to me. ‚ÄúI brought
                    mine, too.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">From her small backpack, she pulls out her sketchbook that I saw in the boba shop.
                    I watch her hands, faint paint still on her fingers. A trademark. Linh notices, glancing down, and
                    tries to hide it. ‚ÄúSorry, I was trying to t in some painting time before and probably should have
                    washed it o better.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs all good. It‚Äôs very‚Ä¶ you. You know, being an artist and all that.‚Äù I see
                    the same expression from before, like she doesn‚Äôt quite know how to read me, so I rush to add,
                    ‚ÄúAnyway, yeah, I only took a few notes so far. I had to Google how to write a food review. That‚Äôs
                    the level of confidence I have right now.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh laughs, sitting back. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a tip. I‚Äôve learned in reading art reviews that
                    the best reviews aren‚Äôt just about the art or whether it‚Äôs good or not. It‚Äôs also how other patrons
                    will react to it. What meaning the art piece might have to others.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood to know.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have any issue at all on the food part, though. I mean, we grew up in
                    the business. We know good food, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her words summon into memory our rst meeting&mdash;the rst time we reviewed
                    something together in a way. I crack a smile, relaxing a bit more. We take a few minutes with the
                    menu before ordering a tempura assortment, shrimp and vegetable, to share, then ordering
                    ramen&mdash;<i class="calibre5">tonkatsu</i> ramen for me and spicy miso ramen for Linh.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Linh says, stitching together her fingers and leaning forward. ‚ÄúWhat kind of
                    place is perfect for a date? Maybe it‚Äôd help to think about that as you review it.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Of course, to contribute to my under-qualifications&mdash;add the fact that I‚Äôve
                    never been on a date, either. Unless you count one lunch with a girl at Burger King during a
                    sixth-grade eld trip.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre12">Which I tell Linh, and she just laughs. She‚Äôd probably gone on
                    more dates than me. Most of my classmates probably have, too. So it shocks me when she says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve
                    never been a date either. So I guess we‚Äôre even.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs comforting.‚Äù I pick up my pencil, tapping it against my notebook. ‚ÄúDates
                    have to be somewhere you can actually get to know someone. Like us right now.‚Äù I wish I could take
                    the words back. <i class="calibre5">Does she think that</i> I <i class="calibre5">think this is a
                        date?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">But Linh doesn‚Äôt seem to notice, adding, ‚ÄúThe noise level has to be just right so
                    that it‚Äôs an actual conversation. Like, if someone is speaking quietly, you should still be able to
                    hear that person.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDimly lit atmosphere with a noise level that‚Äôs perfect for conversations and
                    whispers,‚Äù I say aloud as I write.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I feel like she means it. We go back and forth with other requirements of a
                    ‚Äúperfect date‚Äù: a nice seating or standing arrangement; an activity that both people like and could
                    talk about later. The waitress drops by with our appetizer, then disappears again.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUltimately, I think both people on the date need to be comfortable, as if you
                    could literally share everything and anything. Which is why the setting matters,‚Äù Linh says.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Our waitress shows up again with a bowl, her fellow waiter tagging along with
                    another bowl. I make a note about the short waiting time. I start salivating the moment the aroma
                    wafts from my ramen&mdash;intense and smoky. It doesn‚Äôt disappoint. The rst spoonful of broth coats
                    my tongue in a silky layer, and the noodles are still rm yet give way easily under my teeth. The egg
                    is sweet and salty, soaked in umami.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRemind me to thank Ali,‚Äù Linh says into her spoon. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like most other
                    ramen, which goes overboard with the salt.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood ramen doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre drowning in a bowl of salt,‚Äù I pretend to
                    write. ‚ÄúYou want to trade for a second?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We exchange bowls, keeping our utensils. Linh pauses and blows on her broth. ‚Äú<i
                        class="calibre5">ƒÇn ƒëi, con</i>,‚Äù I say, mimicking countless cousins or aunts at family
                    gatherings who are almost always chasing an impossible toddler to feed.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs now midbite but she laughs, then covers her mouth.
                    ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt! You just made me spit!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOn a date, it‚Äôs important not to sit across from anyone who spits,‚Äù I add to my
                    invisible list.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh telepathically lets me know to shut up. Her ramen is pleasantly spicy, the
                    texture of the broth similar to mine, the kind that sits comfortably on the tongue, doesn‚Äôt attack
                    you.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My earlier nervousness is completely gone now as we alternate the time eating,
                    describing our food, and complaining about school and balancing working at the restaurants. She
                    talks about how her parents set her up with an engineering student they know so she can ask
                    questions. Which is a good idea&mdash; and I hope my parents don‚Äôt think of it. I‚Äôm ne with limiting
                    the times I disappoint someone.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh takes pictures of her ramen, and she starts with her sketch of the restaurant,
                    outlining the most prominent parts: the walls, tables, and chairs. ‚ÄúFor size comparison.‚Äù Her pencil
                    seems to oat above the page instead of touching it and she falls silent now, locked in her world. A
                    world I‚Äôm finally getting a look at.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Watching Linh‚Äôs thoughts play across her face is‚Ä¶ interesting. I remember how she
                    looked that night, distress rippling across her face, the indecision as her eyes fitted between me
                    and the restaurant.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">For years, my parents‚Äô issues with her family were a separate, weird thing that I‚Äôd
                    accepted, one of their many oddities&mdash;like their near-worship of lottery numbers, their
                    insistence with each wrong number that they were <i class="calibre5">just</i> about to give that
                    number. Or M·∫π‚Äôs tendency to use me or my dad to get a double-tasting of samples at the supermarket.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow can your parents <i class="calibre5">not</i> want you to be an artist?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt mean to disrupt her, but it pulls her out of her head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI guess it doesn‚Äôt feel stable to them. My parents aren‚Äôt really about making tons
                    of money. It‚Äôs about making just enough to sustain themselves. They didn‚Äôt have that when they came
                    over, so they wanted it for me.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThey escaped too?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThey escaped,‚Äù she con rms. ‚ÄúBy boat.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre12">I spoon some of my remaining broth, watching the surface
                    ripple. All my life, I thought it was normal that my mom and dad had left by sea. They‚Äôd known each
                    other growing up and left in the same boat owned by the second cousin of a mutual friend. Their
                    connection to this boat owner might have been loose, but they were past caring. Trustworthiness
                    during this time was a messy ideal anyway. They just had to leave. But after hearing conversations
                    from my mom‚Äôs friends, conversations with other Vi·ªát kids at school, families came another way:
                    through sponsorship, through marriage.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But I feel like it does say something about the type of people my parents are
                    &mdash;Linh‚Äôs parents, too&mdash;to put trust in the unknowable sea, in the people who navigated the
                    boats to the ultimate destination. Survivors.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt tell your parents about wanting to be an artist because they don‚Äôt
                    see it as a viable career.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh nods. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I have to keep it a secret. Some secrets are good. They can
                    be helpful.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúStill, it‚Äôs hard to keep a secret.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">You‚Äôre</i> keeping a secret. You haven‚Äôt exactly told your
                    parents that you‚Äôre working with me on this newspaper assignment.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs not the same thing, but I can‚Äôt figure out how to say it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMe and my art&mdash;I‚Äôm not really lying. I‚Äôm downplaying it,‚Äù Linh continues. She
                    fiddles with the end of a chopstick, not looking at me now. Somehow I feel as if I‚Äôve stepped over an
                    invisible line. ‚ÄúOkay, I guess it‚Äôs hiding. But it‚Äôs necessary!‚Äù She directs the last line at me,
                    suddenly insistent. ‚ÄúFirst of all, you‚Äôre a guy, so you probably get away with a lot of things.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I open my mouth to argue, but I remember a cousin at a gathering complaining that
                    her brother had a later curfew because he was a guy. ‚ÄúOkay, I see that.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut my parents are pretty much insistent that I do <i
                        class="calibre5">anything</i> but be an artist. To do this, I have to lie. There‚Äôs no other way,
                    really,‚Äù Linh says, defensiveness seeping in at the edges. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not usually a liar.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not calling you a&mdash;I‚Äôm just saying.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs my fault things went a little sour. Linh‚Äôs now avoiding further conversation
                    by zoning in on her sketchbook. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ne.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre12">Later, our goodbye is less hopeful than our last one the
                    night we had boba.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">This isn‚Äôt a date, so why does it feel like I messed everything up?</p>
