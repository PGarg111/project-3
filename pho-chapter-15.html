                <h3>Chapter 15</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">My phone buzzes as a text comes in. I lift my head from the pillow, my bleary eyes
                    searching for my alarm clock, which tells me the time is eight thirty. Who’s texting me <i
                        class="calibre5">now</i>? Despite having the uncanny ability to wake up early&mdash;probably
                    drilled in by his parents, who took him on morning delivery routes all his life&mdash; Việt’s never
                    the one to text rst; he only responds to them, three days too late. The only other person who texts
                    me consistently is Mẹ, through Ba, and if she wanted me to actually wake up, she wouldn’t be this
                    discreet.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Nothing is more efficient at waking you from a dead sleep&mdash;while also drawing
                    out an involuntary, undignified high-pitched scream&mdash;than a Vietnamese mother bursting through
                    the door without warning.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I grapple for my phone and squint down at my screen.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">hey! it’s linh. i got your number from
                            ali.</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh. Last night’s events trickle through my hazy mind. Boba. Our walk. Partners.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">I sit up immediately.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">sorry to bother you so
                            early.</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Should I tell her I don’t recall ever giving Ali my phone number&mdash;and part of
                    me is perplexed at how she managed that? Another time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">no worries! i’m up anyway.</b></span>
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">The bubbles appear. An exclamation point! <span class="calibre13"><b
                            class="calibre16">are you an early riser, too?</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">yeah</b></span> <i
                        class="calibre5">&mdash;</i>I start typing, then change my mind. Why would I want to lie about
                    that? <span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">only when my mom’s threatening my

                            you usually up this early on weekends?</b></span></p>

                <p class="calibre12">I grow more awake with each word. We’re doing this! We’re making plans, together!
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">totally.</b></span> My thumb hovers
                    over my next sentence. <span class="calibre13"><b class="calibre16">can’t wait!</b></span></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bubbles appear. Those damn bubbles.</p>
                <p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000074.jpg" alt="" class="calibre17" /></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now I can go back to sleep.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">It’s nearing ten when I finally wake up again. Strangely my mom hasn’t barreled in to
                    scream at me. When I go down still in my sweats and T-shirt, I see my parents sitting at the table,
                    like they’ve convened for a meeting. They’re already dressed.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re not working?” I ask, fighting past a big yawn.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We’re going in the afternoon. But we thought we’d eat out today.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We never eat out. Which can only mean: We’re going on a spying mission.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I don’t remember when it started, but this isn’t the rst time we’ve gone to a
                    competing restaurant to see if it’s really any competition to ours. Only my parents would do this.
                    Really. Because they’re weird and obsessed, and they like to bring me into their odd hobbies. And
                    maybe, in an odd way, it’s their attempt to compromise. I’d always wanted to eat out: McDonald’s.
                    KFC. Red Robin. When I begged and begged, my mom’s reply was always the same. That it was a waste of
                    money and&mdash;</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-92" class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">“I can make that. And I can make it even
                        better!”</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">So far, my parents have managed not to bicker over the GPS and we haven’t gotten
                    lost yet. That tells me Ba probably did advance research.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Anh, slow down,” my mom says. She’s in the passenger seat, death-gripping the
                    handlebar just over her head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I look at the meter. Forty- ve miles per hour.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How’d you hear about the place?” I ask my parents, resigned to my fate.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“One of our customers mentioned it in passing,” Mẹ says. “But don’t worry: That
                    customer is loyal to us.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh, I was</i> so <i class="calibre5">worried.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">We pull into the parking lot of a plaza. The restaurant’s surrounded by upscale
                    jewelry stores and “elite” nail salons, and that con rms&mdash;at least to me&mdash; that the
                    restaurant won’t be legit. It’s all too… new. Too shiny. Where are the errant shopping bags rolling
                    along with the breeze? Discarded rinds from clementines or lychees?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">This is what happens when we step inside “photastic.” Purposely all lowercase.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Trời Đất</i>,” my mom mutters rst. Usually it’s an “Oh my
                    god,” but in this case it means, <i class="calibre5">What shit is this?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Everything in the restaurant is white: the walls, the tiles, the tables, and
                    chairs.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Even the host is white, wearing a T-shirt printed with a poorly drawn <span
                        class="calibre13">BÁNH</span> <span class="calibre13">MÌ</span>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Where’s the shrine? What kind of Vietnamese restaurant doesn’t have a shrine?
                    Where’s the red? And yellow? Fake flowers? The floor that’s seen better days?</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">“Chao, Bac!”</i> says the host, missing the tones completely.
                    He has the audacity to bow. “Table for three?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Dumbstruck, my parents nod. Even though the waiter’s annoying me, I almost laugh at
                    my parents being speechless for once.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Not for long, at least.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“A white waiter?” Mẹ hisses after we get our menus. We sit in the center at a round
                    table that Ba moves around to see if it’s lopsided. It’s not, which, to me, makes this place even
                    more inauthentic. “Speaking horrible Vietnamese, too.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre12">“We can always turn around,” I say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No,” Ba says firmly and calmly, pushing a menu to me and Mẹ. “This is competition.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Barely!” my mom protests.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He overrides her. “Let’s see why that customer is talking to you about this place.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">We fall silent when the waiter&mdash;John, because of course&mdash;returns again.
                    He asks if we’re ready to order and Ba <i class="calibre5">actually</i> pulls out a list of menu
                    items and reads them off.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">See: research.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">When the confusion dawns on John’s face, my stomach drops.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m sorry, sir. Can you repeat that?” John looks to me, like I’m expected to
                    translate for Ba. I look away from him, wanting to prolong his misery. We get this a lot when we go
                    out to non-Vietnamese places&mdash;and maybe this is why we don’t go out often. Obviously, my dad’s
                    accent gives him away. He wasn’t born here like me. But even though I understand him perfectly,
                    sometimes he gets nervous&mdash;but doesn’t want to say so&mdash;and he speaks quickly. When I was a
                    kid &mdash;bowl-cut me, let’s just say&mdash;it was embarrassing. Maybe it was the look others gave
                    him, or the visible discomfort in my parents.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now I’m just annoyed by people like John.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba clears his throat, sits up straighter in his seat. “Co ee. For the three of us.”
                    He slows his words as he relays the rest.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, yes, sorry.” The red in the waiter’s ears&mdash;now he’s
                    embarrassed&mdash;fades while he jots down the order.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The time waiting for our food consists of my mom and dad’s airing their complaints
                    against the place. Seems like we’re the only Vietnamese family here. The lights are too bright. They
                    gave us “organic” <i class="calibre5">cà phê sữa đá</i> that was already served in a glass with ice.
                    Real Vietnamese restaurants make the customers do their own work. The only concession is
                    good-looking waiters&mdash;one, as my mom points out, resembles a K-pop star.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Then the food comes. Turns out, even a kid who didn’t grow up in a restaurant could
                    tell this wasn’t any legit Vietnamese restaurant. General atmosphere aside, the kitchen was only
                    doing a poor imitation of the Việt food I recognize. The <i class="calibre5">cơm chiên</i> doesn’t
                    have Chinese sausage&mdash;what kind of fried rice dish is this? Other crimes include oversalting
                    the phở and not crisping up the</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre15">sh enough.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Dở ẹc!</i>” my mother says, a look of disgust on her face as
                    she sorts through the mushy sh. She’d already removed the bones and they slid o suspiciously
                    cleanly. If it were really done well, the bones would refuse to come o , and you’d have no choice
                    but to use a hand and chopstick pair to remove them.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No doubt, this restaurant will close within a few months,” Ba finally says, pushing
                    away his unfinished plate. I repeat: unfinished.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh’s text about our rst assignment comes to mind. I ask my parents if I could
                    duck out of my shift early next week. And then the interrogation happens.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I have a newspaper assignment.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Newspaper? When?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Just this year. I’m writing food reviews.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You?” my parents ask, simultaneously stunned and incredulous.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yes,” I answer exasperatedly. “It’s something I started doing.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You are writing about food?” Ba asks for confirmation.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“He does eat like Ba,” Mẹ mutters, still staring at me. “But why?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Because Linh’s going to do it too</i>. Not the best answer to
                    give. “Because it’s something to do. I thought you’d be more excited that I’m doing, you know,
                    something.” Using my chopsticks, I stu a bite of white rice in my mouth, trying to act casual. Too
                    <i class="calibre5">ngảo</i>. Mushy.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Writing… You never said you liked it,” my mom says.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Just because I never talked about it doesn’t mean I didn’t like it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You did like reading dictionaries as a kid,” Ba concedes. Turning to my mom, his
                    tone shifts to a joking one. “Maybe he’s seeing his girlfriend.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ catches on, her preoccupation flying away. “Ha! Like that would happen.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Funny, guys. Funny. Girls like me!” I decide to play along. “There’s at least one
                    girl in each class who likes me. Kelly Tran. Fiona Su. Cindy Jackson.” The idea of these girls
                    liking me sends my parents laughing. Even I’m joining in. Me and Kelly, the girl who despises me for
                    avoiding VSA duties like the plague?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre12">Later, I won’t be able to explain why I said what I said next.
                    Maybe it’s a slip of the tongue, or because it’s a notion even more ridiculous than Kelly, Fiona, or
                    Cindy having a crush on me. Right after Cindy, Linh’s name slips through my lips.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A dark expression crosses my mom’s face, like clouds engulfing the sun. “Linh Mai?”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">There’s a dangerous tone in her question, and I immediately retreat. “Just kidding.
                    I’ve never talked to her in my life.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Good.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I mean, she’s, like, really weird. Like, really, <i class="calibre5">really</i>
                    weird. No one likes her at school,” I say. “And she smells!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Acting: not my career path. My parents continue glaring at me stonily, the playful
                    mood from before gone. “Seriously, I’m not seeing anyone. I really am on assignment for the
                    newspaper.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">This causes my mother to lean back, shoulders relaxing.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A different waiter has come back&mdash;mixed, Vietnamese and white, maybe. Her grin
                    falters when she notices my mom’s fury.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Can I get you anything else, <i class="calibre5">cô</i>?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom softens her expression, musters a smile. Maybe she’s consoled in seeing
                    another Vietnamese person in the room. “Yes, we’re ready.” She cracks open the menu again. “Let’s
                    try the dessert.”</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5">All the guys here have perfect hair.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">That’s my rst observation as I walk into the restaurant that Ali had assigned us.
                    The host disarms me with his bright smile as he greets me in Japanese. Average height, he’s still
                    made tiny by the large wooden desk that he stands behind. The divider’s just low enough to let me
                    see the waiters walking around, their polished hair&mdash;many of them with the hair of a Silicon
                    Valley guy post-startup phase. Many immaculate man-buns, which the host also has. I’d look
                    ridiculous if I tried wearing my hair like that.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre12">Linh hasn’t arrived yet, and in various hand gestures, I let
                    the host know that I’ll wait for a few seconds. Looking up: stalactites&mdash;thin wooden structures
                    jutting down from the ceiling, painted to mimic the top parts of northern Japanese hemlocks.
                    Somewhere in my research about this place, I remember seeing that the chef is from Kyushu, specifically Fukuoka. Maybe this art was inspired by his home. I sneak my notepad from my back jeans
                    pocket&mdash;Ali forced it on me, saying it’d make me look more “legit.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I turn to the mirrors functioning as walls. Strands of hair still stick out no
                    matter how much gel I use. I’m so preoccupied that I don’t notice Linh sneaking up on me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She arches an eyebrow. “Everything okay?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Um… hair,” I manage to articulate.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her mouth moves like she’s fighting words back. Or a smile. “It looks ne.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We let the host know that we’re from La Quinta, and as Ali promised, the restaurant
                    was expecting us. Ken, the host, leads us past the dividers. While the waiting room transports you
                    to a different height, the main dining room brings you back to the ground, literally. The oor takes
                    on the cool colors of a modern city; the walls, the outlines of high-rise buildings, adorned and
                    labeled with the sleekness of kanji. Japanese pop music brings an intimate, personal vibe that calms
                    me immediately. It reminds me of seeing out the last customers for the day, of the feeling right
                    before I throw myself into bed.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The other diners are mostly Asian&mdash;a good sign&mdash;and aged young. We don’t
                    recognize anyone, which makes sense since it’s a city away. We get seated, and I sneak a look at
                    Linh smiling and nodding at the waitress who swooped in. Linh asks about the artwork, sparking life
                    into the waitress’s eyes. Maybe she’s an artist, too. I take down parts of the conversation: her
                    uncle’s the chef and yes, he wanted the restaurant decor to be an homage to his home island.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We were just fixated on the idea that art can say so much about family history.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I totally understand! I’m working on something similar.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre12">I make a note to ask about that. When the waitress leaves,
                    though, we’re alone, forced to look at each other, and suddenly my ability to speak has retreated
                    somewhere else. Our time at the boba shop might as well have been a dream. I resist the urge to
                    straighten the bottle of soy sauce between us, just to do <i class="calibre5">something</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’ve been taking notes already?” Linh nods at the notepad next to me. “I brought
                    mine, too.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">From her small backpack, she pulls out her sketchbook that I saw in the boba shop.
                    I watch her hands, faint paint still on her fingers. A trademark. Linh notices, glancing down, and
                    tries to hide it. “Sorry, I was trying to t in some painting time before and probably should have
                    washed it o better.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, it’s all good. It’s very… you. You know, being an artist and all that.” I see
                    the same expression from before, like she doesn’t quite know how to read me, so I rush to add,
                    “Anyway, yeah, I only took a few notes so far. I had to Google how to write a food review. That’s
                    the level of confidence I have right now.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh laughs, sitting back. “Here’s a tip. I’ve learned in reading art reviews that
                    the best reviews aren’t just about the art or whether it’s good or not. It’s also how other patrons
                    will react to it. What meaning the art piece might have to others.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Good to know.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You won’t have any issue at all on the food part, though. I mean, we grew up in
                    the business. We know good food, don’t we?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her words summon into memory our rst meeting&mdash;the rst time we reviewed
                    something together in a way. I crack a smile, relaxing a bit more. We take a few minutes with the
                    menu before ordering a tempura assortment, shrimp and vegetable, to share, then ordering
                    ramen&mdash;<i class="calibre5">tonkatsu</i> ramen for me and spicy miso ramen for Linh.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So,” Linh says, stitching together her fingers and leaning forward. “What kind of
                    place is perfect for a date? Maybe it’d help to think about that as you review it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Of course, to contribute to my under-qualifications&mdash;add the fact that I’ve
                    never been on a date, either. Unless you count one lunch with a girl at Burger King during a
                    sixth-grade eld trip.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre12">Which I tell Linh, and she just laughs. She’d probably gone on
                    more dates than me. Most of my classmates probably have, too. So it shocks me when she says, “I’ve
                    never been a date either. So I guess we’re even.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That’s comforting.” I pick up my pencil, tapping it against my notebook. “Dates
                    have to be somewhere you can actually get to know someone. Like us right now.” I wish I could take
                    the words back. <i class="calibre5">Does she think that</i> I <i class="calibre5">think this is a
                        date?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">But Linh doesn’t seem to notice, adding, “The noise level has to be just right so
                    that it’s an actual conversation. Like, if someone is speaking quietly, you should still be able to
                    hear that person.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Dimly lit atmosphere with a noise level that’s perfect for conversations and
                    whispers,” I say aloud as I write.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I feel like she means it. We go back and forth with other requirements of a
                    “perfect date”: a nice seating or standing arrangement; an activity that both people like and could
                    talk about later. The waitress drops by with our appetizer, then disappears again.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ultimately, I think both people on the date need to be comfortable, as if you
                    could literally share everything and anything. Which is why the setting matters,” Linh says.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Our waitress shows up again with a bowl, her fellow waiter tagging along with
                    another bowl. I make a note about the short waiting time. I start salivating the moment the aroma
                    wafts from my ramen&mdash;intense and smoky. It doesn’t disappoint. The rst spoonful of broth coats
                    my tongue in a silky layer, and the noodles are still rm yet give way easily under my teeth. The egg
                    is sweet and salty, soaked in umami.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Remind me to thank Ali,” Linh says into her spoon. “It’s not like most other
                    ramen, which goes overboard with the salt.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Good ramen doesn’t feel like you’re drowning in a bowl of salt,” I pretend to
                    write. “You want to trade for a second?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We exchange bowls, keeping our utensils. Linh pauses and blows on her broth. “<i
                        class="calibre5">Ăn đi, con</i>,” I say, mimicking countless cousins or aunts at family
                    gatherings who are almost always chasing an impossible toddler to feed.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre12">Linh’s now midbite but she laughs, then covers her mouth.
                    “Don’t! You just made me spit!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“On a date, it’s important not to sit across from anyone who spits,” I add to my
                    invisible list.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh telepathically lets me know to shut up. Her ramen is pleasantly spicy, the
                    texture of the broth similar to mine, the kind that sits comfortably on the tongue, doesn’t attack
                    you.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My earlier nervousness is completely gone now as we alternate the time eating,
                    describing our food, and complaining about school and balancing working at the restaurants. She
                    talks about how her parents set her up with an engineering student they know so she can ask
                    questions. Which is a good idea&mdash; and I hope my parents don’t think of it. I’m ne with limiting
                    the times I disappoint someone.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh takes pictures of her ramen, and she starts with her sketch of the restaurant,
                    outlining the most prominent parts: the walls, tables, and chairs. “For size comparison.” Her pencil
                    seems to oat above the page instead of touching it and she falls silent now, locked in her world. A
                    world I’m finally getting a look at.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Watching Linh’s thoughts play across her face is… interesting. I remember how she
                    looked that night, distress rippling across her face, the indecision as her eyes fitted between me
                    and the restaurant.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">For years, my parents’ issues with her family were a separate, weird thing that I’d
                    accepted, one of their many oddities&mdash;like their near-worship of lottery numbers, their
                    insistence with each wrong number that they were <i class="calibre5">just</i> about to give that
                    number. Or Mẹ’s tendency to use me or my dad to get a double-tasting of samples at the supermarket.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How can your parents <i class="calibre5">not</i> want you to be an artist?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I don’t mean to disrupt her, but it pulls her out of her head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I guess it doesn’t feel stable to them. My parents aren’t really about making tons
                    of money. It’s about making just enough to sustain themselves. They didn’t have that when they came
                    over, so they wanted it for me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“They escaped too?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“They escaped,” she con rms. “By boat.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre12">I spoon some of my remaining broth, watching the surface
                    ripple. All my life, I thought it was normal that my mom and dad had left by sea. They’d known each
                    other growing up and left in the same boat owned by the second cousin of a mutual friend. Their
                    connection to this boat owner might have been loose, but they were past caring. Trustworthiness
                    during this time was a messy ideal anyway. They just had to leave. But after hearing conversations
                    from my mom’s friends, conversations with other Việt kids at school, families came another way:
                    through sponsorship, through marriage.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But I feel like it does say something about the type of people my parents are
                    &mdash;Linh’s parents, too&mdash;to put trust in the unknowable sea, in the people who navigated the
                    boats to the ultimate destination. Survivors.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So you don’t tell your parents about wanting to be an artist because they don’t
                    see it as a viable career.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh nods. “That’s why I have to keep it a secret. Some secrets are good. They can
                    be helpful.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Still, it’s hard to keep a secret.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">You’re</i> keeping a secret. You haven’t exactly told your

                <p class="calibre12">“Me and my art&mdash;I’m not really lying. I’m downplaying it,” Linh continues. She
                    fiddles with the end of a chopstick, not looking at me now. Somehow I feel as if I’ve stepped over an
                    invisible line. “Okay, I guess it’s hiding. But it’s necessary!” She directs the last line at me,

                <p class="calibre12">“I’m not calling you a&mdash;I’m just saying.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It’s my fault things went a little sour. Linh’s now avoiding further conversation
                    by zoning in on her sketchbook. “It’s ne.”</p>
