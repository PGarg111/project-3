                <h3>Chapter 26</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">Gold Key. Phở Day Part II. Gold Key. Bảo. Gold Key. Bảo. There are so many things
                    competing for purchase in my mind. I want to shut o these rivaling thoughts, but my normal way of
                    coping&mdash;painting or sketching&mdash;isn’t happening as easily. I’m fidgeting, my attention
                    straying. I made the mistake of looking in the mirror this morning and could have sworn that a ghoul
                    was staring back at me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m in the art room during lunch, as usual, feeling Bảo’s absence. The window
                    curtains are drawn to block the afternoon light, but not enough to block the rays completely. The
                    room is awash with pale blue and it calms me so much. I’m in the center of the room, earplugs in to
                    try to get myself to focus, though I end up preoccupied by the motes of dust seemingly suspended in
                    the air.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My phone vibrates once. I look over and see that unfamiliar number again. I’ve
                    gotten it two times already. Probably spam, so I’ve been ignoring it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hey, Linh.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I pause, wanting to see if I have to turn to greet him. He’ll see the ghoul that
                    was me this morning. When I do turn around, his expression doesn’t change. “You busy? Need to talk
                    to you&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I brush back my hair, nervous. “Bảo&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He holds up a hand. A sheepish smile is on his face. “Not about <i
                        class="calibre5">that</i>. It’s actually something that Chef Lê mentioned to me. Did he call
                    you?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Chef Lê?” Now I’m confused.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah&mdash;” His eyes catch on something to his right. He laughs.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-173" class="calibre12">He points to his hair, then to mine. I mimic the gesture and
                    thread my fingers through mine, feeling something wet&mdash;it’s <i class="calibre5">paint</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, shoot.” I whirl around, trying to spot the roll of Bounty that I always keep
                    around, but I can’t find it. Embarrassment flushes my face. <i class="calibre5">Great.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">When I turn back, Bảo is there, gently grabbing the wet piece of hair and dabbing
                    it with a paper towel. I hold my breath, relishing the feel of him close to me, the feel of his eyes
                    on me. His touch. Tender.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“There,” he whispers. “All better.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He steps away and I feel my shoulders fall. My heart pumps at an indecent pace.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bảo realizes what he’s done and he drops the towel on the nearest stool. “Um,
                    anyway. Chef Lê’s been trying to reach you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh!” I glance at my phone. The strange number. “What does he want?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">His smile looks strained. “Give him a call back. He’ll explain. But I think it’ll
                    be good news. It might actually be fun, you know. It’s perfect for you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He stands, shoulders slightly hunched, unsure. Before, he would have made himself
                    comfortable at his own table. Might have even hovered nearby to peek at my work.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I hate that I did this. The stilted conversation, the pauses. It’d been easy
                    before. Now everything’s changed because of these feelings&mdash;because of all that’s working
                    against us.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I guess… I guess I’ll see you later, Linh,” Bảo finally says.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The room is awash in more shadows than I realized.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">If I looked tired earlier, I can only imagine how I look now, even more so with the
                    mystery of Chef Lê’s message weighing heavily in my mind. My parents aren’t as tactful about my
                    appearance when I come to work. Ba’s straightening the tablecloths that just came in. I was right.
                    It made the light inside less piercing to the eyes. It’s almost like spring has come to the
                    restaurant. The fake daisies that we bought complete the picture.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre12">My dad stares at me a little longer. <i class="calibre5">“Con
                        bệnh hả?”</i> He uses the back of his hand to feel my forehead, checking if I’m sick.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Mẹ sẽ</i> make ginger tea,” Mẹ says, standing up from her
                    booth, where she was eating an early dinner.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Ngồi xuống đi</i>,” Ba suggests to me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ba, Mẹ, I’m ne.” I brush away his hand. “I just… didn’t put on makeup this
                    morning.” <i class="calibre5">And I also have too much to worry about</i>. But the closeness allows
                    me to see the bags under his eyes. He must be worried about Phở Day again. We’re all worrying, them
                    more than me. My issues pale by comparison to theirs.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You look worse than that.” Ba turns to Mẹ. “Perhaps she should go home and sleep.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, I’m okay,” I grumble, even as the thought of bed is enticing. A chance to be
                    alone and recharge.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Right, she should sleep.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba says firmly, having Mẹ’s agreement, “Sleep. We want you to be rested for Phở Day.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">But I don’t go home, not right away, at least. Instead, I’m sitting in my car
                    outside Chơi Ơi. After leaving my parents’ restaurant, I drove around mindlessly, taking the longer
                    route home, an excuse to clear my mind. But then I remembered the missed calls from Chef Lê’s
                    number. I shoved my phone away in hopes that I wouldn’t need to think about it. Or think about Bảo.
                    Before I knew it, though, I reached down for it, and started driving.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The parking lot is relatively bare, but I expect it to ll up around dinnertime,
                    which is within an hour.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Why does he want to see me?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I meet Sa ron, his wife, at the front. “My husband was raving about your sketch!”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, thank you, I’m glad he liked it.” My voice comes out at. <i
                        class="calibre5">Did I sound like this the whole day?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her smile falters by a fraction. “Are you okay?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-175" class="calibre12">I sidestep the question. “Um, is Chef Lê around?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh! He’ll be happy to see you. The column’s been something of a sore spot for us,
                    and he couldn’t figure out what to do until he saw your work. He knew you’d be the right person to
                    dress it up.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Column? It hits me then, that I hadn’t even thought to listen to his voicemail. But
                    now it all connects.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">At her words, the rst spark of warmth comes back to me. Chef Lê actually wants to
                    hire me? A high school student?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Go ahead, you can nd him in the back.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m heading in that direction until I see the tape cutting o a section of the
                    restaurant, a curtain shrouding that part in mystery, keeping it out of sight from wandering
                    customers. Curiosity getting the best of me, I cross the room and part the curtains to face the
                    white column. It’s a good size, with a lot of space to work with. Done right, it could make a nice
                    splash.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Miss Mai!” Chef Lê says, dropping a towel that he was using to wipe his hands.
                    “Glad you got my message.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Is this&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He nods, slapping the column. “Yep, the real estate.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A vision of what it could be surges forward in my mind. This column is in the
                    center of the room, so it should naturally draw the eye. It needs bold colors, ones that won’t clash
                    with the rest of the walls, but complement them. Mostly, the decor already shows o landscapes. What
                    we need now are people. Faces as vivid as the discerning ones who will come to dine here.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Emerging from my thoughts, I almost miss the amount he’s offering to pay me. I ask
                    him to repeat himself. “If you’re gonna try to say that’s too much, I’m not going to listen,” he
                    says good-humoredly. He reminds me of my parents, how they don’t let anyone refuse payment.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why me?” I manage to ask.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Chef Lê tips his head back and his laugh bounces o the walls.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Like I told Bảo, I know talent. You’re talented, Linh.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Talent.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A wave of sadness catches me o guard. It travels up inside me, splitting into
                    tendrils. There are people who have faith in me, and they shouldn’t. I’m not the person they need.
                    I’m always second-guessing myself, running away scared.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-176" class="calibre12">I touch the column with my fingertips; it’s damp and newly
                    painted with base coat. I spot the tarp and drops of white, and I see a pair of Converse. Red.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bảo. Sa ron appears right behind him, carrying some towels. “Chef Lê, where do you
                    want&mdash;Linh?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I look closer. The edges of his sleeves appear as if they’d been dipped in white as
                    well. Some specks are on his jeans.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Did Bảo do this? Was Bảo actually painting?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Right over there’s good. You came just in time. I’m trying to strike a deal with
                    Linh.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh.” Bảo stays put, glancing between the column and me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re supposed to paint the column, not yourself,” I say, fighting back a smile. He
                    offers an uncertain one in return. Another pause, one that Saffron appears to notice, because she sets
                    down the towels, then coughs delicately.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Bry, I need to talk to you for a sec. Over there?” She’s already walking back out
                    toward the curtains.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What, now?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yup.” She disappears outside.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Chef Lê follows half in, half out. “But, Sa &mdash;” There’s some whispering,
                    growing more insistent. “What do you mean, leave them alone? We’re just&mdash;” A hand grabs his
                    collar, yanking him through the curtains, out of view. I look over at Bảo, who’s watching in
                    bewildered amusement. He catches me peeking and normally we’d laugh together, but he sobers up
                    immediately.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He examines his sleeves. “Shouldn’t you be at work?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“My parents sent me home. They think I might be getting sick.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He frowns in worry, and walks closer, less hesitantly then he had before. My heart
                    leaps when he touches me on the forehead. That doesn’t help things. “I knew you looked off before.
                    Shouldn’t you be in bed, then?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m not sick. I’m just tired.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You have a lot going on,” he murmurs. His hand curves around my jaw, his thumb
                    lingering on my cheek. He stays like this longer than I think he realizes.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">And when he does, he takes a wide step back. “Sorry.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, it’s&mdash;” Again, the air between us tightens. “Why are you here, Bảo?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-177" class="calibre12">“I had a day off. So I decided to stop by and give a hard copy
                    of my piece to Chef Lê. And then we just got to talking and he wanted to get the column ready.” He
                    quickly rushes to add, “But I told him you didn’t say yes yet. He just got excited and pulled out
                    all of this and before I knew it&mdash;” He gestures to the mess on his clothes. “When Chef Lê wants
                    something, he just does it, apparently.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I circle the column, my fingers tracing the parts that are relatively dry. Bảo
                    follows close behind like there’s a string loosely connecting us.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“A small part of me, I guess, was still hoping you’d show up.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But you couldn’t have known I’d come here.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Still, he came. “I know.” The earnestness of his statement moves the ground beneath
                    me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The column. Big and vast. There are so many designs it can take. So many
                    possibilities in every way. I can paint another cityscape. I can paint the people that Chef Lê holds
                    closest to him: his wife, his dad, his late mom. I can make the colors as bright as they can
                    be&mdash;I can use normal colors; I can mix my own. I can make something beautiful out of this.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Inside, the tendrils of anxiety settle down. I take a deep breath.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bảo’s offering these options to me. Just like the night he stepped over enemy lines
                    to help me. He always wants to help me. I’m always the one to turn him away, always having a reason
                    to keep a distance. This understanding touches me in a way I can’t voice with words, and God, I wish
                    I could paint my feelings right here for him.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Yet, words&mdash;my inadequate words&mdash;are all I have in this moment. So I
                    choose.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hypothetically, if I accept Chef Lê’s o er, it’d take a lot of work to get this
                    mural done.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A handsome smile graces his face. “You could do this. I’ve seen your work.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’d be hard, too. I probably won’t know what to do with it half the time.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That’s ne. Inspiration doesn’t come that easily.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s something just for me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bảo nods again. “After all the things you’re doing, you deserve a break sometimes.”
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre12">“Even though I still wouldn’t know what to do about our
                    families.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s oka&mdash;” He levels his gaze at me. “Linh?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Thank you,” I say in a rush, before tackling him with a side-hug that coaxes a
                    short laugh from him. After hesitating for a millisecond, his arms come around me, and we lean into
                    each other.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">When I paint, there’s always a moment where I <i class="calibre5">just know</i>
                    that I’m finally</p>
                <p class="calibre4">finished. The colors and textures come together to depict a feeling of <i
                        class="calibre5">rightness</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Us, here, is that rightness.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I breathe him in. I nestle my head into the crook of his neck, fitting myself into
                    him like a piece of puzzle.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Yes, I want him. I want us.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Him loosening his hold on me and the sharp catch in his breath tell me he</p>
                <p class="calibre4">finally gets it. Still, he leans back to con rm the answer. A hand that circled my</p>
                <p class="calibre1">waist slides up my arm. The other gently, so gently, remains on my hip. A ne shiver
                    passes through me and I hold my breath, but my heart hiccups. He cups my cheek with a hand and his
                    face inches forward.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Can I?” he asks.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I meet him there.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ecstatic colors surround us, the happiest of colors, yellow, orange, pink swirling.
                    Blooming. Like we’re in Monet’s <i class="calibre5">Water Lilies</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">No. This is all mine. This is <i class="calibre5">my painting</i>. I want to
                    memorize this feeling and make my own masterpiece.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I press my lips against his more insistently. He makes a small noise of surprise,
                    but I feel his smile. It’s surreal, us kissing here. I’ve tried to tamp down all of these feelings
                    for the wrong reason, but now I can show them. This, <i class="calibre5">this</i> feels so right:
                    the quiet smack of lips parting before coming together, the exhaling out of noses, and his hand
                    light against my neck, keeping me in place&mdash;not that I ever, ever want to move away. All I care
                    about right now is his arms around me, his lips on mine, and the utter freedom I feel to slide my
                    hands through his hair. Finally.</p>
