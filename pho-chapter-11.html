                <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">One of my earliest memories of learning Vietnamese at home and at the temple with
                    other kids has to do with a traditional folk poem. If I close my eyes, I‚Äôm back in that basement
                    room, surrounded by our teacher‚Äôs singsong voice, loud over the overhead ceiling fans ghting o a
                    July heat: <i class="calibre5">C√¥ng cha nh∆∞ n√∫i Th√°i S∆°n / Nghƒ©a m·∫π nh∆∞ n∆∞·ªõc trong ngu·ªïn ch·∫£y
                        ra‚Ä¶</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">I was more enthralled by the image that went with the folk poem: a towering,
                    majestic mountain wrapped inside a delicate fog. Father. A pool of glistening water gushing from the
                    same mountain. Mother. The next lines talked of honoring their labor and love; the lesson was clear
                    enough: Everything I do is in their re ection.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now alone in my bedroom, I lie at on my back, staring at the ceiling fan turning at
                    the slowest speed possible no matter how far right I turn the knob. I thought the room would feel
                    more spacious since I wasn‚Äôt sharing with Evie anymore, as I‚Äôve done for sixteen years. That I can
                    decorate however I want, make it however messy I want. But my body became used to another person in
                    the room, and any desire to rearrange things is forgotten.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Anyone walking in would see two distinct personalities&mdash;one wall immaculately
                    decorated with cute thrift-shop nds&mdash;Evie can sni out discounts like no one else‚Äôs business. My
                    side, while it might be just as clean, holds years of my artwork, no rhyme or reason to the colors,
                    from drawings showing my childhood obsession with goats and llamas, to my more recent work.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">On my Picasso desk calendar, I marked the thirtieth but somehow didn‚Äôt mark Ph·ªü
                    Day. I trace it with my nger&mdash;it‚Äôs not the end of the world if I don‚Äôt go. I know that. But am
                    I giving something up? Missing out?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-36" class="calibre12">I sit up quickly and my vision spins. Sometimes when I think
                    too much, I make myself sadder, which doesn‚Äôt help at all. I nd refuge in art, escaping thoughts
                    like this, to regain control when life throws another obstacle my way. When I work, magic happens;
                    for a few hours at a time, the world just slips away. I don‚Äôt have to listen to customers comparing
                    me to Evie. Any worries about upcoming tests or working a shift at the restaurant&mdash;that all
                    takes second place in my mind. My attention xates on an image or an idea that doesn‚Äôt exist just
                    yet, and can‚Äôt exist without me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I rst saw art in action when my family and I took a trip to Huntington Beach. We
                    were walking along the boardwalk; I was still young, because I remember holding my mom‚Äôs hand when
                    <i class="calibre5">it</i> happened. A small crowd had formed, a sketch artist ensconced inside, his
                    canvas before him. His muse, a little boy, sat in a chair, feet dangling. The boy tried and failed
                    to look serious as the artist captured his likeness on the canvas. He kept grinning at his parents.
                    It was only ve bucks for a portrait, yet the artist treated him like the most important being in the
                    world.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I stayed there the entire time, counting the artist‚Äôs deliberate strokes. My mom
                    waited alongside me, half interested and half ready to move. We would have if only we hadn‚Äôt reached
                    the end of the boardwalk.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The artist‚Äôs still there these days, though his hands look more shriveled and
                    sun-spotted than they did over a decade ago.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I breathe out, letting go of my memories, replacing my thoughts with a nicer
                    reality: <i class="calibre5">Maybe no one will show up and I won‚Äôt need to work that night. Maybe my
                        parents will be in such a good mood that they‚Äôll let me go.</i> Their moods are always good
                    indicators of whether or not I can do anything. <i class="calibre5">This is your year</i>,
                    Yamamoto‚Äôs voice says in my head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm choosing to believe that can be true.</p>
                <p class="calibre1">Our home has only one oor, with a long hallway connected to each room. I pad lightly
                    across the tiled oor to the opposite end, where M·∫π and Ba‚Äôs room sits.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre12">At the door, I hear only whispers. I‚Äôm seven again,
                    eavesdropping on my parents like I used to with Evie. Evie would be right across from me, mouthing,
                    <i class="calibre5">What are they saying?</i> because she was never the stealthy type, didn‚Äôt have
                    good hearing, and completely sucked at reading lips. Through the slit of the door, I see my father
                    lying prone, shirt o . In the morning, he‚Äôs usually half naked, baring his stomach, and wakes up
                    before everyone else, then shu es through each room, lifting up all the window blinds.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">M·∫π stands next to the bed, a tube of Bengay in plastic-gloved hands. She scolds him
                    in Vietnamese. I lean back against the wall, out of view.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou should have let someone else carry it. You‚Äôre not young anymore, Anh.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHmm? One of our cooks? They can barely lift anything. I‚Äôm the only one who lifts
                    things back there.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe only one,‚Äù M·∫π repeats sarcastically. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba, ever the stubborn one, answers, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He hisses as she slathers Bengay on his
                    back. She then tells him calmly that if he keeps complaining, she‚Äôll actually break his back. I hide
                    a smile even if I don‚Äôt have to. Ba stems his protests and M·∫π takes o her gloves. I hear her go into
                    the bathroom, the creak of the mirror as she puts back the Bengay.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWill we need to hire someone for the day?‚Äù Her voice echoes. ‚ÄúI can ask Duy-Loan‚Äôs
                    cousin to work.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He doesn‚Äôt answer right away, as if he‚Äôs waiting for her words to subside. ‚ÄúWe have
                    Linh.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He says my name like I‚Äôm the solution. A ash of anger courses through me. Why do I
                    always have to be the solution?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou know we can‚Äôt a ord more people,‚Äù Ba continues. ‚ÄúI think it will be</p>
                <p class="calibre15">ne. I can still help.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Wait. What does he mean?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIf you say so.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">They haven‚Äôt told me about any nancial problems. My stomach drops as I remember how
                    anxious my mom looked yesterday, the hope in her voice that the special will work. Of course. But
                    then I remember they wouldn‚Äôt have told me something like this. They don‚Äôt want me to worry about
                    things that <i class="calibre5">they‚Äôre</i> supposed to be worried about. Typical.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-38" class="calibre12">Later, sitting down for dinner at the kitchen table, I smell
                    the Bengay, but Ba doesn‚Äôt complain, only winces as he slowly sits down at the head of the table. I
                    slide over our bowls, which M·∫π just lled with rice&mdash;mine full to the brim, while hers is half.
                    She eats the side dishes more than the rice.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">M·ªùi Ba ƒÉn c∆°m. M·ªùi M·∫π ƒÉn c∆°m</i>,‚Äù I say before we start
                    eating.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We don‚Äôt immediately talk, each of us lost in our thoughts. Our chopsticks ding the
                    sides of our bowls. The waves of steam from the <i class="calibre5">canh chua</i> rise up, swirled
                    away by the ceiling fan. It‚Äôs one of my favorite dishes&mdash;sour soup, but not the kind sold in
                    Asian restaurants. It‚Äôs made sweet from pineapple chunks, and balanced out with simmering tomatoes
                    and tamarind. M·∫π asks if I want more cat sh. I shake my head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I swallow a clump of rice and muster as much eagerness into my voice as I can. ‚ÄúPh·ªü
                    Day will be fun.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre1">By Saturday, Ba‚Äôs back problems are worse, and now he can barely move. M·∫π and I
                    leave around noon to start prepping for the rush, but before we do, M·∫π reminds Ba not to do anything
                    too strenuous. Ba lies across the living room couch, TV remote in hand, which is his preferred state
                    whenever he has time o , but he wants to work tonight. As much pain as he‚Äôs in, he‚Äôs still thinking
                    about the restaurant.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mom‚Äôs having none of it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He continues his protest in Vietnamese. ‚ÄúNo, you need me tonight. Who‚Äôs working the
                    stand?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLisa.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba snorts. ‚ÄúLisa! She doesn‚Äôt know how to do anything!‚Äù Lisa‚Äôs been working for us
                    for three weeks, a replacement for the outgoing seniors.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">M·∫π answers, ‚ÄúBa say that about her all the time. And Jonathan&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúEveryone, basically,‚Äù I mumble. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre the one who hired them.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba just glares. He lies back down, staring at the ceiling.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut what if something goes wrong?‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre12">My entire morning was spent alone in my room, preparing myself
                    for tonight‚Äôs rush. I was so tense that I couldn‚Äôt concentrate, couldn‚Äôt even sketch in my note pad
                    or pick up a brush. Ba complaining throughout the house didn‚Äôt help things.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Yet now, I hear the genuine worry in his voice, the worry that everything he had
                    masterminded would undo itself.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">M·∫π pats his head as she passes by, keys in hand. <i class="calibre5">‚Äúƒê·ª´ng lo.‚Äù</i>
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">The simple truth is that he can‚Äôt get up; all three of us know this. He falls
                    silent. Or more accurately, M·∫π silences him by shutting out any response with the front door.</p>
                <p class="calibre1">One thing that people forget when they‚Äôre yelling at waiters or complaining about
                    meal prices is the realities of how much prep goes into the menu. It‚Äôs hours. I learned that the
                    hard way when I was young, hanging out in the kitchen, waiting for M·∫π to be done because she said
                    she was ‚Äúonly doing prep.‚Äù <i class="calibre5">Only doing</i>. No. That meant watching the outside
                    go from incandescent yellow to midnight blue with specks of white from the street lamps. But it was
                    fun back then. I always had my crayons with me. The waiters and line cooks took their turns watching
                    after me or cooking up something sweet&mdash;caramelized plantains sort of became my drug. Evie took
                    it upon herself to re ll all of the hoisin bottles.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now in the kitchen, my mom has two large pots cooking on the stovetop, all
                    containing the broth for tonight. Four small pots sit on the prep table, ready to be reheated once
                    the orders come through. M·∫π strides with purpose in the kitchen while the other line cooks chop
                    green onions, limes, and jalape√±o peppers, and wash bean sprouts and Thai basil that makes the anise
                    in the ph·ªü broth pop even more. It‚Äôs all a rhythm; they follow the beat set by M·∫π because they‚Äôve
                    done this for forever. She‚Äôs the most methodical in the kitchen, though whatever method she uses
                    here can‚Äôt be replicated or measured. It‚Äôs instinctive. My art and her cooking are kind of the same,
                    when I think about it. Our hands move before our brains. But I never say this out loud, because the
                    retort would be: ‚ÄúBut will it support you?‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-40" class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everyone on the outside?‚Äù she asks when she notices me
                    watching by the door.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I double-knot my apron strings, then sweep my hair into a high ponytail. ‚ÄúGood.
                    Everything‚Äôs in place.‚Äù Servers are setting out the soup spoons, chopsticks, and sauces.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">M·∫π wipes her forehead with the back of her gloved hands. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she repeats. I
                    wonder if she‚Äôs trying to make herself feel better about tonight. Like I am.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The rst wave of customers are young college students. Lisa greets them, clumsily
                    grabbing the menus. I hope she can pull it together before the real challenge begins.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Within a half hour, our tables are booked and a line has formed, a sight that would
                    make Ba giddy&mdash;as giddy as he can get, at least. Instead, my body pings with a sense of
                    foreboding. As I move to table six with plates of egg rolls, a chatty group of three passes by,
                    Jonathan leading the way. He mouths, <i class="calibre5">Help!</i> before plastering on a fake smile
                    to the group, who seat themselves at table eight&mdash; which I‚Äôm sure is reserved.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I make a beeline toward the booth and sort through the table management system. I‚Äôm
                    right. Lisa comes back from seating another group, playing with her hands. She does this when she‚Äôs
                    nervous. ‚ÄúLisa, did you check the system just now?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTable eight. Someone had a reservation and we were going to seat them there.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Lisa glances down and blanches. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm <i class="calibre5">so</i> sorry, I didn‚Äôt see
                    it!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I tamp down my instinct to shout, like Ba would. ‚ÄúJust nd a way to x it.‚Äù I turn
                    sharply and control my breathing. It‚Äôs not my usual job to greet the guests, only serve them. Lisa
                    will need to do it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Passing by table four, I see a little kid, age six or seven, reach for a bottle of
                    hoisin while his mother chats with a friend. I summon the Mai and Ph·∫°m women‚Äôs stare&mdash;<i
                        class="calibre5">M√†y ƒëang l√†m g√¨?</i>&mdash;and the kid retracts his hand. As he should.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-41" class="calibre12">The sound of pots and pans from the kitchen grates on my
                    nerves, threatening to send a headache my way. But there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop it, so I hand in
                    my orders, then circle back to the stand to make sure Lisa hasn‚Äôt messed up again&mdash;I can‚Äôt help
                    it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">If possible, the line outside has gotten longer. More college students. Families.
                    Couples. They stare back at me as I pop my head out, a sea of eyes reminding me of a surrealist
                    painting.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, excuse me, miss,‚Äù a guy wearing cargo shorts asks. He‚Äôs third in line. ‚ÄúHow
                    long will it be until we‚Äôre seated?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAbout a half hour.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHalf hour, whoa.‚Äù He sends a look to his friend who stands behind him.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I tamp down my annoyance as best I can. ‚ÄúAs you can see, it‚Äôs quite busy now.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThis is ridiculous,‚Äù he mutters to his friend.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe apologize for the wait, but there‚Äôs nothing more we can do.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs taking so long?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The. Nerve.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey! We‚Äôre having a special! So of course there will be a line!‚Äù I snap. The guy
                    reels back for a second, rendered speechless. He‚Äôs too shocked to be angry. Before a morti ed
                    apology can slip past my lips, Lisa sidles up to my side, taking control of things. She shoots me a
                    concerned look and says a few things that I can‚Äôt make out. The fact that Lisa needs to save me
                    pisses me o even more.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I stalk back to the kitchen. Pine for the art exhibition. I pretend I‚Äôm there right
                    now&mdash;me with other patrons. Whenever I‚Äôm at a museum, seeing the work of geniuses before me, I
                    imagine a cloud of quiet reverence settling over me. In the room, there‚Äôs a bunch of people looking
                    to art for answers, who examine pieces just to <i class="calibre5">feel</i> something.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">One day, I want to be that artist who sees this, who knows that what she created
                    made them feel completely content, lling a void they didn‚Äôt know they were seeking.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I want to be there‚Ä¶</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-42" class="calibre12">‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm here. The ticket machine pushing out food orders at
                    crank speed yanks me back into my reality. Its chirping will stay in my nightmares forever. From the
                    dining room, Vietnamese, English, Spanish, and other languages and laughter swell up, crashing into
                    me like a tsunami wave. The back room now feels like a sauna.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCon?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom pops her head out when she realizes no one‚Äôs picked up the three bowls of
                    ph·ªü she just placed at the window.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI just need some air,‚Äù I say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJust one minute!‚Äù I say. Using my whole body, I push through the back door, my
                    mom‚Äôs question chasing after me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I duck into the alley. I don‚Äôt care that it smells like sh and sewage or that the
                    ground might be dirty; it‚Äôs the best sanctuary I can nd in the moment. I slide down, bring my legs
                    to my chest, and rest my forehead on my knees. <i class="calibre5">Breathe, Linh. Breathe.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm not sure how long I sit there. At least I‚Äôm alone. At least no one‚Äôs here to
                    see me fall apart like Jenga pieces.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUm, hey.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I peer down at the scu ed edges of red Converse.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh no.</i></p>
