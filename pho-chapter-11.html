                <h3>Chapter 11</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">“Infestation.” The word is usually negative, referring to bugs or something else
                    that causes illnesses, but it accurately describes how thoughts of Linh swarm my mind lately.
                    Yesterday after school, as I was wiping down tables, my thoughts drifted to Linh and last week’s
                    encounter. Then, noticing I wasn’t doing any work, Mẹ whacked me good on the head, propelling the
                    image of Linh&mdash;hair tied up like that night and that damned smile&mdash;from me. Việt laughed,
                    watching me recover. He knew what was distracting me because I’d already given him a recap in our
                    forensic science class together, waiting for our teacher to get here.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Linh Mai.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You talked to Linh Mai.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Linh&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Okay, you can stop saying her name like that.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s just hard to believe. You actually helped the enemy.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Do <i class="calibre5">you</i> see her as an enemy?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yes, but that’s what I know your mom would want me to say.” A slow smirk began to
                    form on his face. “The question is: Do <i class="calibre5">you</i> see Linh as the enemy?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I never did,” I answered quickly, almost marveling at the truth of it. Việt arched
                    an eyebrow, which I’d never seen him do.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I still can’t believe you actually talked to her. I never thought that’d happen. I
                    mean, way to go!” I was somewhat amazed and bolstered by his enthusiastic reaction… like he was
                    cheering me on.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-62" class="calibre12">“You’re strangely happy about this. Meanwhile, I’m dead if my
                    mom ever</p>
                <p class="calibre15">nds out about this.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I don’t know. It’s just… you’re taking a risk. Going out of your comfort zone. And
                    you don’t usually do that.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">All of this was true, but it was something I’d never heard coming from my best
                    friend.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now, I’m debating the possibility that my school schedule is conspiring to keep me
                    and Linh separated. When I do “see” her, it’s just the usual ash of her hair as she turns the
                    corner. I can never seem to nd her during passing time or lunchtime.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A nagging thought comes to mind: What if Linh’s actually dodging me? Did something
                    happen after I left her? Maybe her mother <i class="calibre5">did</i> see us and told her o . Maybe
                    Linh agreed not to speak to me because of that. It’s not hard to imagine what she’s heard about me
                    and my family over the years.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A few minutes before sixth period&mdash;journalism class&mdash;I reach into my
                    locker to exchange books. Allison basically said she was “a bit” disappointed by the quality of our
                    recent articles, so there’s going to be a long lesson on how to write. Is Rowan ever going to step
                    up and remind Allison that she’s still a student? I mentally and emotionally prepare myself, when I
                    sense someone next to me. I close my locker.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My day hasn’t completely gone to shit. “Linh. Hey.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh leans her shoulder against the lockers. “Here.” She hands me a carton of
                    chocolate milk.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her hair’s down past her shoulders, longer than I remember, and she looks like the
                    Linh post-Phở Day instead of the one I’d checked in on in that alley. My throat feels dry. “What’s
                    this for?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I didn’t get to it at lunch but didn’t want to throw it away. Consider it a small
                    token for helping me out last week.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You really know the way to a guy’s heart.” <i class="calibre5">Okay, Bảo, okay!
                        That was smooth… maybe?</i> We start walking. I try to remember if I’m actually going the right
                    way. “How’s it going?” That’s the question I ask after a WEEK of thinking about her?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-63" class="calibre12">“Good, I’m glad it’s almost over. I feel like it’s been one
                    assignment after another.” Linh then grimaces. “APs especially.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How many do you have?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Three.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My stomach clenches. Three? And she’s still alive?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Plus I have to work tonight.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I do too. Maybe we’ll see each other?” I say this as casually as possible, not
                    wanting to seem like I’m suggesting anything other than, well, just seeing each other.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sure, maybe I can help out this time,” she says conspiratorially, adding a smile.
                    I’m feeling the effects of it&mdash;maybe it’s because she’s so much clearer under the lights&mdash;a
                    nice faintness that I’ve only felt after waking from a long, good nap.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“There’s no chance we can get away with that again,” I say weakly, half as a joke,
                    until it registers that isn’t a joke. It’s the truth. Things just worked out over at Linh’s, but he
                    can’t ever expect that to repeat.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Some of the laughter leaves Linh’s eyes, and we walk in quiet silence, our bodies
                    remembering to feel unaccustomed to each other’s company. That feeling, back when I thought she’d
                    rejected my help, takes over again, until she says, so quietly that I might have imagined it:</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That’s sad to think about… because we worked great together. Like we were meant to
                    be partners.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Partners.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Yeah, it sounds right to me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Eager to just keep talking until we can’t anymore, I ask more about her classes.
                    She asks if Allison is <i class="calibre5">still</i> attending our classes instead of using her
                    study hall time to go home. She seems to talk about Allison with a teasing smile, so I don’t tell
                    her that I’m truly terri ed of her in certain moments.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We make it to journalism class, where&mdash;no surprise&mdash;Allison sits in
                    Rowan’s seat, next to her the biggest Blue Bottle cup of iced co ee I’ve ever seen. In a
                    disorienting move, she smiles at Linh. She looks different when she does that.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hey, lady!” Her eyes fall to me, then icker over to Linh. If possible, her lips
                    widen. “Didn’t think I’d see you two together.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre12">Linh clears her throat. “Ali, I told you about how he helped
                    me out last week? Right?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Rightttt.</i> That was sweet of him. Well, good timing that
                    you’re here. Because I have an idea.” <i class="calibre5">Ali</i> spins in her chair before rising
                    like a villain who finally settled on a plan for world domination.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh no,” Linh says, earning a glance that is both withering and playful from Ali.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So, in one of my classes, some girls were complaining that their boyfriends are
                    taking them to all the wrong places. Boring vibe. Expensive, etcetera, etcetera. So what if we
                    created a whole new beat for the newspaper? Assign a reporter to visit new places that any high
                    school student can go to <i class="calibre5">and</i> actually a ord, and tell the real deal about
                    it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Will restaurants let us do that?” We’re not exactly the <i class="calibre5">Los
                        Angeles Times</i>. Who cares about what someone from La Quinta says about their establishment?
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m sure I can spin something,” she tells me confidently. “It’s basically free
                    publicity for the restaurants.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Okay, yeah, it’s not a bad idea,” Linh says. “Do you have someone in mind?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Good question.” She points both fingers at me. “Bảo, I’d want you on this beat.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">In what way does any of this sound good or helpful to the newspaper? Me who’s been
                    delegated to proofreading duties. Me who consistently gets Bs on his English Lit essays.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why me?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Because you’re better than you think you are, as much as it pains me to say.” Ali
                    watches me closely; there’s a gleam in her eyes telling me she likes that she can shock&mdash;and
                    disturb&mdash;me with her compliments. “And Linh, you can help, too.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her eyes shift to me. “Um…”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hear me out: Bảo puts words to the scene, rates the food, describes it. Since he
                    grew up in restaurants like you and knows food, he should <i class="calibre5">hypothetically</i> be
                    capable of doing this&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hey!” I interject.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre12">“&mdash;and you can sketch the environment. Or paint it. I’ve
                    watched you sketch for years, Linh. You’d be perfect for this. The newspaper desperately needs your
                    talent. It needs something entirely new.” Her voice has taken on a tone I’ve never heard from Ali
                    before&mdash;something more earnest. She’s turning a bit softer, gifting me a glimpse of her normal
                    self, and of their friendship.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh looks away, deep in thought. She said she was taking three APs just earlier,
                    not to mention juggling after-school work at the restaurant. I’m brought back to last week, seeing
                    her in that alley alone, looking overwhelmed, looking lost. Something inside had pulled me toward
                    her then. I just knew I needed to see if she was all right.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">That feeling rises again, and the words are out before I can stop them. “I’ll do
                    it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The girls look at me&mdash;Ali, triumphantly and maybe even a little approvingly;
                    Linh just confused.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I know there’s a lot against me. It’ll take away some of my weekends, most likely.
                    But as long as my parents don’t nd out <i class="calibre5">who</i> I’m working with, this project
                    might work. “And for what it’s worth, Linh, I know you’d be awesome for this, too.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I don’t know if I can do this. It’s not just the workload&mdash;it’s the fact that
                    I haven’t done something like this, let alone had my work published in a newspaper. What if I just
                    <i class="calibre5">think</i> I’m good and it turns out I’m not?” Her question comes out quietly,
                    laced with uncertainty.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, no,” Ali counters immediately. “I don’t think anyone could think that. I’ve
                    seen what you’ve done ever since we were twelve.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“And the flyers. They’re great!” I interject. “If anything, it’s another chance to
                    show just how good you are.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Linh,” Ali says. “You have two people here saying you can do this!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How&mdash;” She pauses. She’s aiming that half-said question at me. I read her
                    mind like that night. We’re part of a long history; we might not be directly involved like our
                    parents, but nothing can change the fact that our families and our restaurants are considered
                    rivals.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">So I keep my answer simple. “We can make it work.” We have <i
                        class="calibre5">worked</i> together and it turned out great. Because it wasn’t anyone’s family
                    against someone. It was just me and Linh then. I want to believe that can happen again.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre12">After a few beats, Linh looks away. “Let me think about it
                    some more.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That’s not a no, so yay!” Ali claps her hands together and hugs her, then turns to
                    do the same to me before remembering herself. Linh still appears unsure, maybe a bit exhausted in
                    her thoughts, but she still musters a smile.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">When we’re alone, Linh says, “Ali only asks for help when she absolutely needs it.
                    So you’ve earned some Ali points.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That’s good, because I was in the negative for a while.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh heads o to her art class. When the last of my classmates walks in, Ali closes
                    the door, game face on. The lights dim abruptly, freaking some kids out, but it’s only Rowan being
                    complicit in whatever torture Allison has cooked up for today. Turns out I don’t really care about
                    that. Linh and I might get to be partners.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I open the chocolate milk carton and sip from it. <i class="calibre5">Partners.</i>
