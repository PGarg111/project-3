                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">“Maybe I just won’t take the SATs again. Maybe I’ll just drop out right now and
                    become the next best American novelist.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I give my best friend, Allison, my <i class="calibre5">You’re annoying me again</i>
                    look, since this is the third time she’s interrupted me as I worked on my latest sketch. “C’mon.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, really. What’s the point of the SATs? There’s no real-life application that we
                    can get here.” She twirls her curly hazel hair with a finger. Her foot kicks my left ankle. “And your
                    legs are in my space again.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I fold them just a bit more, but there’s not much I can do in this booth. “You’re
                    going to do ne. They were ne the rst time around. So what if your math scores aren’t perfect?
                    They’re still great. And you’ll ace the writing part, Ms. Editor in Chief. I know it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“And you’re going to ace all of it. Because you’re Linh fucking Mai,” Ali says. She
                    pretends to take an angry slurp of her <i class="calibre5">cà phê sữa đá</i>, condensation leaving a
                    puddle next to her. Since middle school we’ve always had iced co ee to get us through the mountain
                    of homework we have. Senior year just started but I already feel as if I’m buried.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Some of my co ee spills onto the table, soaks the edges of my cream-colored sketch
                    pad. I don’t clean it up. Ms. Yamamoto is in my head, saying, <i class="calibre5">If you want to be
                        an artist, you’ll need to get messy.</i> I focus on my sketch.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Downtime at the restaurant is actually a nice time to draw. The empty seat next to
                    me to balances my Prismacolors. My eraser, an ugly blend of all the colors I’ve been using, sits
                    beside them. The sketch isn’t going that bad. The assignment: <i class="calibre5">Draw your
                        memories</i>. Instructions: <i class="calibre5">Why the hell should I tell</i> you <i
                        class="calibre5">what to do</i>? Or at least that’s what Yamamoto always says to our art class.
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-13" class="calibre12">I’m drawing a beach scene, remembering the time Ba taught me
                    how to oat on my back, and where Mẹ taught me how to “cook” with sand&mdash;or play make-believe as
                    I dug concave dents in the sand, poured water in them to make <i class="calibre5">bánh bèo ngọt</i>,
                    a sweet steamed treat you can hold in the palm of your hand and eat.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My older sister, Evelyn, stayed under the shade of our umbrella, reading&mdash;of
                    all things&mdash;a book about the human skeleton. Guess who’s now majoring in biology at UC Davis?
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">The tip of my colored pencil breaks as I shade an area under my beach umbrella.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What is it?” Ali says, reaches over her SAT book to touch the picture&mdash;but I
                    quickly slap her hand away. “<i class="calibre5">Jesus</i>, you’re a beast when you’re drawing, you
                    know that?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I pull back my sketch pad. “It’s not ready yet.” And it won’t be if I keep losing
                    focus, or let Ali distract me with her talking.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">And that’s what she does best.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Luckily, I’m used to it. Ali is a fixture in the restaurant after school, and for
                    years, it was me, Evie, and Ali, and nothing really changed, unless you count the fact that now Ali
                    steals the last egg roll, always shooting me an impish grin.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">There was a time for a year when her parents were going through a divorce, and as
                    strong as she was, home was more like a battle eld. The divorce eventually happened, and
                    everything’s more stable now. She’s back to being the Ali who likes my artwork so much that she
                    always has to take a peek at it. She says that one day we’re going to dominate the world&mdash;her
                    as a writer, me as an artist.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What’s with your dad today?” Ali tips her chin toward the front of the restaurant,
                    where Ba takes up his own booth. The light from the front windows streams in, turning his normally
                    salt-and-pepper hair a blinding white. He’s writing the checks for the week, but keeps looking up at
                    the Nguyễns’ restaurant. Best guess is that he’s keeping an eye on the Nguyễns. Ba’s weird like
                    that.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I dunno.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The Nguyễns can’t <i class="calibre5">not</i> see him. My dad isn’t the most
                    discreet person or the stealthiest; every part of him&mdash;his walk, his breathing&mdash;makes
                    noise. My mom, though, is the opposite. She slips in and out of any social gathering, from any room,
                    any conversation, like a ghost. But she’s loudest when she’s cooking; the spices and flavors in her
                    phở, <i class="calibre5">bún bò</i>, and <i class="calibre5">bún riêu</i> are her way of announcing,
                    <i class="calibre5">I’m here</i>.
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-14" class="calibre12">Our plan to do a two-for-one deal combines Ba’s talent for
                    advertising and Mẹ’s cooking, or so Ba claims. But I’m already dreading the ood of people who’ll
                    come. We’re understaffed as it is; we had to say goodbye to three servers who were seniors o to
                    college. We hired replacements, but only one of them seems like they’ll last.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Before I realize it, Ba appears at our table. He sets down a plate of hot, crispy
                    egg rolls that Mẹ sent out from the kitchen. Ali literally <i class="calibre5">ooh</i>s, like she
                    hasn’t eaten a gazillion in the lifetime we’ve known each other.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Cảm ơn</i>, Ba.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He reaches for my sketch, appraises it. “<i class="calibre5">Con vẻ này hả?</i>” he
                    asks evenly. I nod and he dips his chin in acknowledgment. I know he sees I can draw. He wouldn’t
                    have asked me to make the flyers if he didn’t at least approve of my work. “Did you do your homework
                    already?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Dạ</i>, Ba.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba nods, satisfied, and walks back into the kitchen.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">There used to be a time where I brought home every single art project in elementary
                    school and middle school, and they would take it, hang it up. A picture of flowers in a vase still
                    hangs in the kitchen by the in-and-out door. I knew they were proud.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But high school is different. In my freshman year, regulars would come in daily,
                    updating my parents on their kid who went to Harvard, or won a prestigious award, or graduated with
                    honors, or bought them a house. That was when my parents really started paying attention to my
                    grades&mdash;the ones that actually mattered and could get me into a good school.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Toward the end of junior year, I’d brought home a physics exam that I aced and it
                    was only because I studied without sleeping, abandoning an art project I had at the time. The test
                    was worth too much. Mẹ had mentioned it to a regular customer who mentioned a niece who was good at
                    physics and now works as an engineer. Somehow that idea has stuck, and my parents have been pushing
                    engineering as a path for me ever since.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-15" class="calibre12">I’d never seen them look so eager.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Have you told them yet?” Ali pulls me from my thoughts. She is watching me. She’s
                    one of the few who can guess my moods, read me instantly.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“About co ee with Quyền Thành? No, it’s pretty much all set. I can’t back out now.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">My parents don’t usually ask for favors from regulars or their friends. Here’s how
                    it goes: If something is broken in the restaurant and a friend o ers to x it, they protest. That
                    same friend shows up with a toolbox anyway, and my parents grudgingly let them in. When all things
                    are xed, my parents o er to pay them, but their friend protests and argues all the way to the door.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">In that case, an envelope of money might mysteriously end up under their doormat,
                    or in a pocket of their jacket they might hang up inside the restaurant.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But my parents had pulled in a favor when Evie was deciding among schools, and
                    called a few friends of friends to help weigh in. This time they used up another favor, arranging a
                    co ee meeting with that niece who was an engineer. They tell me it’s a chance to ask questions and
                    learn more about “my future.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">How can I say no?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Con,” Ba calls for me. He’s halfway into the kitchen but he gestures to the front
                    where a family of four are waiting to be seated. I slip into my role as waitress, something I’ve
                    done since freshman year&mdash;and even before that. When we’d just opened the restaurant, I
                    remember tagging along with other servers, armed with my own notepad and pen&mdash;or was it a
                    crayon?&mdash;the customers indulging me with smiles.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Table for four? No problem. Just follow me.” I lead the family to one of the
                    center tables, until Jonathan, the most competent of our new hires, easily swoops in.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I slip back into my booth with Ali. She’s chewing on the end of her pencil, stuck
                    with an article she’s writing.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It kills my parents, even now, to have Evie a day trip away instead of at home.
                    Evie was the better server out of us, calm and cool under service. Orderly. Mẹ never had to tell
                    Evie to ll up the napkin dispensers or the bottles holding <i class="calibre5">tương phở</i>,
                    because they were probably already lled.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-16" class="calibre12">And she’s deffnitely more charismatic, like Ali, with the other
                    customers. It’s unsaid, but I know, in the way they ask after Evie, that some longtime customers
                    must be disappointed to have me replace her&mdash;me who would much rather be in my head or in front
                    of a canvas. They tell my parents how proud they should be of her.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“She’ll be a doctor in no time,” these customers say fondly. Then they look significantly at me. “And maybe you can be the same.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Perhaps in other families it would have worked out. I mean, me and Evie are only
                    two years apart, but if anyone didn’t know better, we might as well have been raised under two
                    separate households.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mentioning that I want to major in anything remotely creative? Impossible. Back in
                    freshman year, when the idea of doing something with art just came into mind, we had a regular who
                    had one daughter who couldn’t be more perfect. Straight As, active in everything in her life, her
                    hair always in a perfect bun. She was also one of the best seniors on the dance team and naturally
                    decided to major in dance at college. Supposedly, the dad was more lenient, hence why she was even
                    allowed to, I don’t know, <i class="calibre5">live</i> after announcing her decision. Her mother’s
                    reaction, though, stays with me: “I want to die sometimes! She’ll be poor her entire life. It’ll
                    never work out.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">And my mom just consoled her as if she had lost a child, agreeing with every word.
                    The woman and her daughter used to be close; now the girl’s a choreographer and rarely comes home.
                    Whenever her mom drops by the restaurant, loneliness comes o her in waves.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now I glance around the restaurant, my eyes landing on the familiar parts that make
                    up a place that’s been like a second home for years: our red shrine greeting customers; our private
                    shrine in the back room, where the ceiling is black with soot after so many years of joss sticks lit
                    for worship; the people who come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, people from way back, like
                    Mẹ and Ba’s refugee camp days, who apparently remember everything about me as a child, even if I
                    don’t remember them. I mix them up half the time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Nothing is bad. Nothing is <i class="calibre5">wrong</i>, really.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But it doesn’t feel enough. There’s something urging me to go a bit farther than
                    here. Am I just being sel sh?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-17" class="calibre12">Ali has gotten up to stretch her legs. She stands by the
                    window with Ba and has started talking to him. Leave it to her to talk to someone who doesn’t like
                    to talk unless he has reason to. O -and-on charisma. Ali laughs at something, but Ba looks serious.
                    I leave my sketch and join them, curious.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I can always sneak in, you know. Pose as a customer and steal some recipes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba doesn’t answer right away. It even looks like he’s considering. I roll my eyes.
                    “Ba, no way.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Anything the Nguyễns do, we have to do better. They knock down their <i
                        class="calibre5">chả giò</i> price to four dollars for two rolls, we have to do three dollars
                    and fty cents for the same number of egg rolls. They have ve flavors of <i class="calibre5">sinh
                        tố</i>; we have six</p>
                <p class="calibre15">flavors. I’m never sure who’s winning.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My parents are still trying to catch up to the others in the area, like the
                    Nguyễns, still cognizant of how hard it was to open a new restaurant in the place of one that had,
                    for all purposes, looked successful.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I remember Bác Xuân, the previous owner, coming over to our old San Jose apartment
                    whenever he had a free weekend&mdash;stopping by after seeing his only daughter and his four
                    grandchildren. The oldest, Fay, is getting married later this fall. I remember the slow way he’d shu
                    ed inside and given a satis ed sigh as he sunk into our only comfortable La-Z-Boy chair. He told my
                    parents he wanted to retire and that his daughter, a coworker of my mom’s from a nail salon where
                    she used to work, would rave about my mom’s phở.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">If you make good phở, you can open this restaurant</i>, he’d
                    said.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Things happened so quickly after that. We moved. I transferred schools. The
                    restaurant opened… and suddenly I was only a few feet away from that boy who’d asked me to draw him
                    a Spider-Man. It would have been a good coincidence, and I could have made a friend&mdash;if only it
                    wasn’t made clear that I should never step near their place.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">“Gia đình đó thì dữ lẳm, lại rất là xấu.”</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But how are they mean?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“They don’t pay their sta anything. They owe their suppliers too much money.
                    They&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Just don’t ever associate with them.” My mom had cut my dad o , rarely doing so.
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-18" class="calibre12">I know Vietnamese people like to judge one person based on the
                    whole family, and to my parents, the Nguyễns are the worst, but Bảo is a mystery to me. There, but
                    not. In four years of high school, with more than 2,500 students, we haven’t had one class together.
                    As if our school administrators know of the rivalry and have conspired to keep us apart.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">And high school will be over before I know it and we’ll lead even more disparate
                    lives.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mr. Mai,” Ali says in a mockingly grave tone, “I am more than happy to spy on our
                    enemy if it helps the restaurant biz. Just tell me when.” She goes back to the booth to pack up.
                    “Think I’m about to head home now. I’m on deadline.” She puts on her backpack, groaning at the
                    weight of her books. She stops by the pass-through shelf and pops her head in. “Can I take home some
                    broth, Mrs. Phạm?” Pro tip to getting on my mom’s side: Address her by her maiden name, which she
                    kept instead of taking Ba’s. “My mom’s <i class="calibre5">dying</i> for her next phở x.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Perfect pronunciation, thanks to me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">It’s like you’re confused and asking, “Huh?” except there’s
                        an</i> f.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh. Yeah, I get it. In the pitch that kind of loops around,
                        right? But it’s also like if you’re swearing and saying, “Fu</i>&mdash;<i class="calibre5">”</i>
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Okay, yeah, you got it.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">In Vietnamese, my dad mutters in awe and confusion about how he’s never seen a <i
                        class="calibre5">mỹ trắng</i>&mdash;a white person&mdash;eat phở so many times a week.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I hear my mom’s pleased smile in her voice. “Of course!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her hair tied in a loose bun&mdash;with a pencil, which I can’t ever figure out how
                    to do&mdash;Mẹ appears from the back, wipes a hand on her apron. She o ers Ali a plastic cylinder
                    lled with our signature homemade chicken and beef bone broth.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ali beams at her. “Awesome. Thanks so much, Mrs. Phạm!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We both watch Ali leave the restaurant until Mẹ gushes, “Allison is so <i
                        class="calibre5">dễ thương</i>!” She’s proud that I have a friend who likes her cooking.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba shakes his head. “<i class="calibre5">Con đó khùng</i>.” I laugh. According to
                    my parents Ali can only be cute or a bit weird. I’ll take my dad’s side this time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re not eating?” She points to the egg rolls.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-19" class="calibre12">If I say I don’t have the stomach for it now, she’ll be
                    worried. “Yeah, working on it.” Remembering Ba’s reaction to my sketch, I close my pad and stash it
                    in my backpack, rustling the paper tucked inside.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ms. Yamamoto gave me that yer two days ago. It’s for an exhibition at the Asian Art
                    Museum that will only be there for one night and morning. Chang Dai-Chien’s piece will be displayed,
                    donated by his living family members. He’d been one of the rst to elevate ink painting and traveled
                    all around the world before focusing on perfecting the art of Buddhist paintings. Yamamoto thought
                    I’d be interested. She’s always telling me how it seems I like capturing memories &mdash;rather than
                    something posed&mdash;in my artwork.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Just check it out,” she said, as class was letting out. I was already late for
                    work and ran out the door after grabbing the yer with a quick thanks. But as I looked at it on the
                    walk from La Quinta, I knew I couldn’t miss out on it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ disappears, then returns from the kitchen with her own bowl of phở. She likes to
                    eat before the dinner rush. My insides sigh at the smell: star anise, cinnamon, the earthy tones of
                    chicken and beef bones. She dresses it with shredded thai basil and fresh bean sprouts, a spritz of
                    lime here and there, and</p>
                <p class="calibre4">finishes it with a generous swirl of hoisin sauce, glossy under our lights. A work</p>
                <p class="calibre1">of art.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Beautiful, isn’t it?” She inhales, a small smile on her face. Mẹ’s loud when she’s
                    cooking&mdash;and she’s happiest when she’s eating. And I love her for it. I always want her to stay
                    this way.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She gets sad sometimes&mdash;mornings when she doesn’t let the sun in, leaving the
                    window shades closed so that only slivers of yellow peek through. She buries her head in her pillow,
                    both temples dotted with dabs of <i class="calibre5">dàu xanh</i> to soothe her headache. I hate the
                    smell. It reminds me of sickness and tummy aches, because that’s what they used on me as a kid. Ba
                    cooks on these days. Dinner is always a simple <i class="calibre5">canh sườn bí</i>, which always
                    has less salt than it should, and never measures up to Mẹ’s cooking.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It’s worst whenever it hits the anniversary of her escape in 1983 or when a
                    relative’s death anniversary is just around the corner. Mẹ’s story about her boat escape to the
                    Philippines is the stu of nightmares. I grew up listening to these tales. I’m not sure why&mdash;a
                    lesson, maybe? Like in a <i class="calibre5">hey, listen to the hell I went through so you can have
                        a good life</i> kind of way. But should an eight-year-old have dreams about a pitch-black sea
                    and a boat packed with thirty-nine people, including crying, starving babies?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-20" class="calibre12">It’s not depression, I don’t think. Sometimes, she checks out.
                    That’s all. Like she’s remembering something and can’t get it out of her mind.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It helps when she calls my aunt, her older sister by six years, the one who stayed
                    behind in Vietnam. She’d planned to escape with my mom in tow, along with their older cousins. But
                    the officials had gotten to her, so she pushed my mom ahead, trusting their cousins from there on.
                    They eventually made it to a camp in Palawan, Phillipines. My aunt wasn’t held back in Vietnam for
                    long, and might have bribed her way out.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But she understood then that she wouldn’t be as lucky the second time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ says I remind her of Dì Vàng because we both like to draw and sketch. My aunt
                    had visited us when we lived in San Jose. I was ve. I remember thinking she was like a colorful
                    painting come to life, and when I saw a Kandinsky painting in my sophomore-year art theory
                    class&mdash;one of his <i class="calibre5">Compositions&mdash;</i>I thought: <i
                        class="calibre5">This is her</i>. Kandinsky had always talked about a connection between himself
                    and the viewer, how the role of the artist was to not only excite the senses but trigger the
                    viewer’s soul. Colors and soul&mdash;I saw that in my aunt.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">When my mom and my aunt get on the phone, I know things will be okay. They took
                    care of each other back in Vietnam&mdash;since my grandparents had passed away when my mom was
                    eleven&mdash;and they still take care of each other now. The almost nine thousand miles between them
                    is insignificant.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ smiles as a young couple comes in&mdash;Vietnamese, by the way she greets them.
                    Ba shows them to a table. Charisma on. He’s already pushing the upcoming phở deal by handing out my
                    yer along with the menu. Dad’s latest marketing scheme might work, but it’s going to be hell working
                    during those nights. It will track in a bunch of other Vietnamese people, who were trained by their
                    chopstick-wielding mothers to eat what’s in front of them, <i class="calibre5">then</i> eat some
                    more even if they’re full.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The sight of the yer tickles something in the back of my mind.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“When is it again?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hmm?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-21" class="calibre12">“Phở Day.” <i class="calibre5">Or whatever you call it.</i>
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“September thirtieth, remember? We’ll need your help that day.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Until three weeks ago, we were down three waiters and waitresses. Julia, Kingston,
                    and Huy were a grade above me and left for college. But to say that the new workers were making
                    things easier would be a complete lie. Jonathan was just okay. Lisa, the hostess, gets flustered too
                    easily. And Tài has slippery</p>
                <p class="calibre15">fingers.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I lean back in my chair. Some of the air in the padding squeezes out.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Of course it’s September thirtieth. The same day as the exhibition.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Is Evie coming back to help?” My sister texted the other day and sent me a long
                    string of pictures of her dorm room, a sel e with her new roommate, and a sunrise view of the campus
                    after a morning run.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Maybe if she comes back, she can help out like she used to and I can sneak out.…
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom frowns. “Con, you know your sister is busy with school.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">What about me? I’m busy. I have other things to do. I have a
                        life.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">But I can’t say those things. “Yeah, right, I remember now.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ sighs as she mixes up her phở. “I know this is not the best situation. I know
                    this isn’t how you want to spend your time.” I try protesting, but she only adds, “You are not so
                    hard to read. Your face always tells me everything. I just know.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But we want this to go well. We need it to go well. Or else your father will be
                    grumpy for days.” She glances over at Ba, who’s taking a couple’s orders to the kitchen.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">There’s no way I’ll be able to see the exhibition. No way at all.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. I bite into my egg roll. Soggy.</p>
