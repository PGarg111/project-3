                    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Hoisin sauce is not paint.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We need a sign that says that, because our customers don‚Äôt get it. Today‚Äôs
                        latest work is a misshapen star on the wall. A ve out of ten, if you ask me. The kid‚Äôs parent
                        probably did a double take, snatched the bottle away, then paid the check and left before M·∫π
                        could notice. To be honest, it‚Äôs not like the sauce makes our wall look worse; it‚Äôs just hard to
                        wipe o when it dries. But I try, I really do &mdash;sometimes. Maybe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Various relatives from both sides of my family judge me from their
                        water-stained portraits that hang around the restaurant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I sit down and look ahead at the ve booths I still need to wipe clean, but this
                        heat‚Äôs unbearable and the main fan, the good fan, died last week. Break time. I brush o grains
                        of rice that cling to my apron. Later, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll nd a few that somehow end up under my socks
                        at the end of each shift. On the opposite side, my best friend, Vi·ªát, goes at the same pace as
                        me. His ears are plugged up, probably to block out the <i class="calibre5">Paris by
                            Night</i>&ndash;like soundtrack blasting from the back room, songs on repeat about the
                        Vietnam War, love, war, poverty, war.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát is the most chaotic neutral person I know. On any other day he wastes time
                        by raving about the latest criminal-investigation show he‚Äôs gotten hooked on. I consider that a
                        trade-o ; he‚Äôs the one who su ers through my fascination with strange words. Once I was wiping
                        down a front window from the inside, unknowingly overriding his work and adding more streaks
                        than there were to begin with. I‚Äôd been mentioning the word ‚Äúdefenestrate,‚Äù which made him
                        calmly threaten me with that very word.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre12">Ba stands behind the counter, punching in numbers at the
                        cash register, then piercing receipts onto a spindle. I think he nds the routine satisfying.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The front door opens, the bell shattering the slowness in the restaurant,
                        ushering in more sticky hot air. My mom‚Äôs voice whips two other lingering, taskless waiters to
                        attention, and I snatch up the towel and wipe o bean sprouts, lea ess stems of herbs, and straw
                        wrappers shaped as tiny accordions. M·∫π charges across the room. She drops her plastic shopping
                        bags in the path toward the kitchen, a storm on her face. Everyone clears the way for her; they
                        know M·∫π‚Äôs mood. But Ba‚Äôs expression is as indifferent as his look in their wedding pictures from
                        the 2000s: Stone. Cold.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom slaps down a crumpled piece of paper before him. ‚ÄúAnh, do you know what
                        they‚Äôre doing across the street?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Without looking up, speaking to his calculator, he asks, ‚ÄúDid you get more
                        sriracha sauce?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOn my way back, I saw these ugly posters all over the place.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere was a sale. Did you get them on sale?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs always like this, their conversation misaligned, a <i class="calibre5">not
                            much</i> to a <i class="calibre5">how are you</i> question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLampposts, windows all over Bolsa Avenue!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Glass shatters in the back kitchen. The line cooks start blaming each other,
                        Spanish and Vietnamese mingling together. My guess: B√¨nh did it. That guy sucks at his job more
                        than
                        me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π ignores the noise. ‚ÄúTwo-for-one. Two-for-one bowl of ph·ªü. <i
                            class="calibre5">Tr·ªùi ∆°i</i>.‚Äù Only one family can get her riled up like this. She pauses.
                        ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to steal all our customers. Why isn‚Äôt Anh worried?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba snorts. ‚ÄúTheir ph·ªü is not good. They never have enough salt.‚Äù Now <i
                            class="calibre5">that</i> I can‚Äôt verify. I‚Äôve never stepped foot into the Mais‚Äô restaurant.
                        Because what happens? Apparently my mom will cut my legs o .</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Maybe they had one of the waiters pose as a customer.‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π nods, dialing back her worry. After a moment, she says, ‚ÄúTwo-for-one ph·ªü.
                        Who
                        wants to have ph·ªü <i class="calibre5">l·∫°t</i>?‚Äù She laughs at her own joke about their ph·ªü‚Äôs
                        blandness. Ba joins, too.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre12">Lately their preoccupation with the Mais has ratcheted,
                        probably because they keep hearing about the changes the other family‚Äôs been making, changes
                        that
                        seem to be in direct response to our adjustments. We‚Äôd recently added new wood grain blinds that
                        block out the sun&mdash;just because it looks like they replaced their blinds, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom zeroes in on me. <i class="calibre5">‚ÄúCon ƒëang l√†m g√¨ ƒë√≥?‚Äù</i> She
                        side-eyes
                        my tables. ‚ÄúWhy are the tables still dirty?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not finished yet.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy not? He‚Äôs done.‚Äù M·∫π points to the opposite side.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look across the room at Vi·ªát&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And blink. The tables are shining, and the mirrors are ngerprint-less
                        and&mdash;
                        yes&mdash;hoisin-less. Kid‚Äôs like an Asian Flash. ‚ÄúOh, c‚Äômon,‚Äù I mutter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Gi·ªèi qu√°!</i>‚Äù she says to the traitor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">C·∫£m ∆°n</i>,‚Äù Vi·ªát answers without a trace of an accent
                        even
                        though he was born here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom turns back to me. ‚ÄúHurry up!‚Äù She jabs a finger at me. ‚ÄúAnd x your hair!
                        It‚Äôs
                        so messy.‚Äù I can‚Äôt help it; my hair has a mind of its own.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The poster that M·∫π showed my dad oats to the ground in her wake. Curious, I
                        pick it
                        up, passing by Vi·ªát. Making sure my mom‚Äôs a good distance away, I elbow him. ‚ÄúSuck-up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát lands a punch to my stomach. ‚ÄúLazy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I pretend not to die; he‚Äôs always been stronger than me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát goes into the back room. I look down at the yer. I‚Äôm not sure how anything
                        like this can be considered ugly. It‚Äôs awesome. There‚Äôs no other word for it. Just really
                        cool&mdash;some kind of collage of old and modern Vietnam: a woman wearing a traditional silk
                        white
                        dress and rice hat winking at a camera. You can see the sun and beachline&mdash;reminding me of
                        Nha
                        Trang, my parents‚Äô hometown&mdash;blazing behind her. An airplane ying above the woman spells
                        out in
                        the clouds <span class="calibre13">OH MAI MAI PH·ªû: TWO-FOR-ONE DEAL</span>. With this kind of
                        advertising from the Mai family, my parents should be worrying about <i class="calibre5">our</i>
                        advertising. We don‚Äôt have a Linh on our team.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I glance out the window. As if this poster summons her, Linh appears from
                        Larkin
                        Street‚Äôs direction. She rushes into the restaurant, her flyaway hair alive, her large canvas
                        bag,
                        which she hauls everywhere, hitting her long legs. Over the entrance and below a pagoda-style
                        eave
                        hangs a South Vi·ªát ag just like ours&mdash; yellow with three red stripes&mdash;and it utters in
                        greeting to Linh. She‚Äôs always a colorful blur&mdash;going to class, dashing down La Quinta‚Äôs
                        hallways when the bell lets out, running into the restaurant at 3:30 p.m.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre12">I see her, but I know close to nothing about her. Maybe
                        it‚Äôs a
                        good thing she‚Äôs constantly moving, because if she ever stopped, we might have to talk to each
                        other. And we haven‚Äôt done that since we were kids.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Hypothetically, a Buddhist temple is not a place for insults or threats or a
                        potential bloodbath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôve gone to temple sporadically throughout my life, but the day I met Linh is
                        the
                        most memorable, for many reasons, aside from running into the rest of the Mais and being <i
                            class="calibre5">thiiis</i> close to seeing bloodshed before √îng Ph·∫≠t.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Before meeting Linh, I‚Äôd never seen another seven-year-old kid stab paper with
                        a
                        crayon. Repeatedly. We were in the kids‚Äô room where the <i class="calibre5">ch√πa</i>‚Äôs
                        volunteers
                        babysat kids as the parents went to worship or at least get a moment of silence. Mine were
                        catching
                        up with friends upstairs. There were tables with</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">finger paint, macaroni, glue, and paper, and another table with crayons and</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">markers. I‚Äôm not sure why&mdash;maybe because it was less work&mdash;I went for
                        the
                        crayons.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The other kids sat so far away from Linh because they were afraid she might
                        turn on
                        them. But the look on her face was calm and concentrated&mdash;satisfied, even&mdash;and when
                        she
                        made sure all of the crayons were completely dull, she raised her white paper in triumph. I was
                        closest to her, so she showed it to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The dots formed a complete picture: green grass, a yellow sun, and a
                        red-and-blue
                        swing set.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWow,‚Äù I said, like any six-to-eight-year-old Asian kid with a bowl cut would
                        say.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the playground at my school,‚Äù she answered proudly.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre12">‚ÄúCan you draw Spider-Man?‚Äù Because back then, that was the
                        only
                        thing that mattered to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe. I can‚Äôt remember what he looks like. I need something to look at.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI have one! I can get it!‚Äù I‚Äôd brought along my Spider-Man backpack, but it
                        was
                        upstairs in a cubby with our shoes. We raced out of the room, escaping the volunteers, who
                        didn‚Äôt
                        really try to catch us. Up on the main oor, the temple membership was serving bowls of ph·ªü <i
                            class="calibre5">chay</i> and a white-haired lady waved us over for a bowl of vegetarian
                        soup.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh took her bowl with everything that my family always taught me to use:
                        hoisin
                        sauce, thai basil, and bean sprouts. That told me she knew ph·ªü; she <i class="calibre5">came</i>
                        from ph·ªü. It was confirmed when we both tried the ph·ªü at the same time and said, ‚ÄúBLECH.‚Äù Salty
                        as
                        hell. We left our bowls, quick, then moved on to our destination.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Running, that‚Äôs what I remember. I was chasing a girl I barely knew, but I
                        really
                        wanted that Spider-Man drawing. Before we could get to my backpack, though, M·∫π‚Äôs sharp voice
                        rang
                        out. The one that still summons centuries‚Äô worth of furious Vietnamese mothers. I froze. Our
                        families stood on opposite sides of the room, where Buddha was at the center, accepting gifts
                        and
                        praise from the visitors. Linh and I were caught in between. I waited for Buddha to come alive,
                        chime in, like a referee, and bellow&mdash;while the ground vibrates forcibly &mdash;‚ÄúReady,
                        set,
                        FIGHTTT!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But nothing like that happened.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs mom took one step forward, like she was marking her territory. Her
                        eldest
                        daughter and husband were just behind her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">ƒê·∫øn ƒë√¢y</i>,‚Äù my mom said to me. I thought she was angry
                        at me
                        for running in a temple. I couldn‚Äôt say no and when I was with her again, she gripped my hand
                        tight.
                        Ba hung back, and I remember being confused by the fury barely contained on his face, so
                        different
                        from his usual passivity.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">After that, they all but dragged me and Linh away from each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúYou still haven‚Äôt finished your tables.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre12">Ba‚Äôs voice from the front desk snaps me out of my
                        memories.
                        I‚Äôm still standing by the windows, but I notice the sky is a bit darker and the lampposts are
                        starting to turn on. The din of inside chatter lls my ears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy do you have that yer?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI was thinking of how ugly it looked. M·∫π‚Äôs right.‚Äù I walk to
                        the
                        nearest trash can, hand poised over it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The story of me and Linh at the temple could have been kept as a carefree
                        memory,
                        lost and dusty like an old book in the basement. And I did actually forget about it; she was
                        just
                        one of many kids I‚Äôd run around with and never saw again&mdash;best friends for an hour or two,
                        instead of forever.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then Linh‚Äôs family opened their restaurant across from us ve years ago, and I
                        knew
                        it was her. I knew she still drew, because she carried her portfolio with her everywhere, the
                        size
                        of it almost as big as her body.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I also knew that I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere near her without risking my mom‚Äôs
                        wrath.
                        Disdain was clear in my mom‚Äôs voice whenever she talked about <i class="calibre5">that</i>
                        restaurant, as if it were a person.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">I heard that restaurant underpays its staff.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">That restaurant is connected to a gang; they just moved
                            from
                            San Jose, after all.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">That restaurant blackmailed B√°c Xu√¢n, pushed him out of his
                            business.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That last reason might be why the neighbors didn‚Äôt accept them so easily at</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">rst. B√°c Xu√¢n had basically helped the area flourish, connecting fellow business
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">owners with the right people. Beloved, you can say. I don‚Äôt think my mom‚Äôs
                        circle of
                        friends made it any easier for <i class="calibre5">that restaurant&mdash;</i>social wolves who
                        ran
                        various businesses in the area: like Lien Hoa BBQ Deli, nail and hair salons, and even one
                        travel
                        agency. Back then advertising wasn‚Äôt really a thing, so the good word of one of these women?
                        Certified. You either get a <i class="calibre5">d·ªü ·∫πc</i> or a <i class="calibre5">c≈©ng
                            ƒë∆∞·ª£c</i>, the
                        latter being as close to great as you can get in terms of Vietnamese praise. Their group is led
                        by
                        Nhi Tr∆∞ng, an older woman who constantly liked to brag that her name bears a similarity to one
                        of
                        the female military leaders to rebel against the Chinese domination centuries ago&mdash;as I
                        discovered on Wikipedia. As if that was supposed to impress people these days. I think of her as
                        the
                        General, though the real-life Nhi Tr∆∞ng was the general‚Äôs daughter.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre12">She had a special reason for hating the Mais; she‚Äôd always
                        liked B√°c Xu√¢n‚Äôs spot and said it‚Äôd gotten the most tra c. I bet she was planning to go for it
                        right
                        when the rst opportunity came up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Luckily gossip changes and some attention spans are short. Now the Mais‚Äô
                        restaurant
                        has become a fixture just like ours. But that doesn‚Äôt stop my mom‚Äôs competitive streak.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My parents&mdash;my mom, really&mdash;have now perfected the art of
                        non-encounters,
                        knowing their schedule right down to when they close and when they leave. In a way, their
                        schedule
                        has become ours. We‚Äôre background characters in each other‚Äôs stories.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">As I look at the poster in my hands, though, I wonder if it‚Äôs possible for us
                        to
                        change up our scripts. What would happen if our families came face-to-face with each other like
                        that
                        time at the temple? What would me and Linh say to each other?</p>

                        years, it was me, Evie, and Ali, and nothing really changed, unless you count the fact that now
                        Ali
                        steals the last egg roll, always shooting me an impish grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">There was a time for a year when her parents were going through a divorce, and
                        as
                        strong as she was, home was more like a battle eld. The divorce eventually happened, and
                        everything‚Äôs more stable now. She‚Äôs back to being the Ali who likes my artwork so much that she
                        always has to take a peek at it. She says that one day we‚Äôre going to dominate the
                        world&mdash;her
                        as a writer, me as an artist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with your dad today?‚Äù Ali tips her chin toward the front of the
                        restaurant,
                        where Ba takes up his own booth. The light from the front windows streams in, turning his
                        normally
                        salt-and-pepper hair a blinding white. He‚Äôs writing the checks for the week, but keeps looking
                        up at
                        the Nguy·ªÖns‚Äô restaurant. Best guess is that he‚Äôs keeping an eye on the Nguy·ªÖns. Ba‚Äôs weird like
                        that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The Nguy·ªÖns can‚Äôt <i class="calibre5">not</i> see him. My dad isn‚Äôt the most
                        discreet person or the stealthiest; every part of him&mdash;his walk, his breathing&mdash;makes
                        noise. My mom, though, is the opposite. She slips in and out of any social gathering, from any
                        room,
                        any conversation, like a ghost. But she‚Äôs loudest when she‚Äôs cooking; the spices and flavors in
                        her
                        ph·ªü, <i class="calibre5">b√∫n b√≤</i>, and <i class="calibre5">b√∫n ri√™u</i> are her way of
                        announcing,
                        <i class="calibre5">I‚Äôm here</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-14" class="calibre12">Our plan to do a two-for-one deal combines Ba‚Äôs talent for
                        advertising and M·∫π‚Äôs cooking, or so Ba claims. But I‚Äôm already dreading the ood of people who‚Äôll
                        come. We‚Äôre understaffed as it is; we had to say goodbye to three servers who were seniors o to
                        college. We hired replacements, but only one of them seems like they‚Äôll last.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Before I realize it, Ba appears at our table. He sets down a plate of hot,
                        crispy
                        egg rolls that M·∫π sent out from the kitchen. Ali literally <i class="calibre5">ooh</i>s, like
                        she
                        hasn‚Äôt eaten a gazillion in the lifetime we‚Äôve known each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">C·∫£m ∆°n</i>, Ba.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He reaches for my sketch, appraises it. ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Con v·∫ª n√†y
                            h·∫£?</i>‚Äù he
                        asks evenly. I nod and he dips his chin in acknowledgment. I know he sees I can draw. He
                        wouldn‚Äôt
                        have asked me to make the flyers if he didn‚Äôt at least approve of my work. ‚ÄúDid you do your
                        homework
                        already?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">D·∫°</i>, Ba.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba nods, satisfied, and walks back into the kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">There used to be a time where I brought home every single art project in
                        elementary
                        school and middle school, and they would take it, hang it up. A picture of flowers in a vase
                        still
                        hangs in the kitchen by the in-and-out door. I knew they were proud.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But high school is different. In my freshman year, regulars would come in
                        daily,
                        updating my parents on their kid who went to Harvard, or won a prestigious award, or graduated
                        with
                        honors, or bought them a house. That was when my parents really started paying attention to my
                        grades&mdash;the ones that actually mattered and could get me into a good school.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Toward the end of junior year, I‚Äôd brought home a physics exam that I aced and
                        it
                        was only because I studied without sleeping, abandoning an art project I had at the time. The
                        test
                        was worth too much. M·∫π had mentioned it to a regular customer who mentioned a niece who was good
                        at
                        physics and now works as an engineer. Somehow that idea has stuck, and my parents have been
                        pushing
                        engineering as a path for me ever since.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-15" class="calibre12">I‚Äôd never seen them look so eager.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHave you told them yet?‚Äù Ali pulls me from my thoughts. She is watching me.
                        She‚Äôs
                        one of the few who can guess my moods, read me instantly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAbout co ee with Quy·ªÅn Th√†nh? No, it‚Äôs pretty much all set. I can‚Äôt back out
                        now.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My parents don‚Äôt usually ask for favors from regulars or their friends. Here‚Äôs
                        how
                        it goes: If something is broken in the restaurant and a friend o ers to x it, they protest. That
                        same friend shows up with a toolbox anyway, and my parents grudgingly let them in. When all
                        things
                        are xed, my parents o er to pay them, but their friend protests and argues all the way to the
                        door.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In that case, an envelope of money might mysteriously end up under their
                        doormat,
                        or in a pocket of their jacket they might hang up inside the restaurant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But my parents had pulled in a favor when Evie was deciding among schools, and
                        called a few friends of friends to help weigh in. This time they used up another favor,
                        arranging a
                        co ee meeting with that niece who was an engineer. They tell me it‚Äôs a chance to ask questions
                        and
                        learn more about ‚Äúmy future.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">How can I say no?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCon,‚Äù Ba calls for me. He‚Äôs halfway into the kitchen but he gestures to the
                        front
                        where a family of four are waiting to be seated. I slip into my role as waitress, something I‚Äôve
                        done since freshman year&mdash;and even before that. When we‚Äôd just opened the restaurant, I
                        remember tagging along with other servers, armed with my own notepad and pen&mdash;or was it a
                        crayon?&mdash;the customers indulging me with smiles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTable for four? No problem. Just follow me.‚Äù I lead the family to one of the
                        center tables, until Jonathan, the most competent of our new hires, easily swoops in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I slip back into my booth with Ali. She‚Äôs chewing on the end of her pencil,
                        stuck
                        with an article she‚Äôs writing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It kills my parents, even now, to have Evie a day trip away instead of at home.
                        Evie was the better server out of us, calm and cool under service. Orderly. M·∫π never had to tell
                        Evie to ll up the napkin dispensers or the bottles holding <i class="calibre5">t∆∞∆°ng ph·ªü</i>,
                        because they were probably already lled.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-16" class="calibre12">And she‚Äôs deffnitely more charismatic, like Ali, with the
                        other
                        customers. It‚Äôs unsaid, but I know, in the way they ask after Evie, that some longtime customers
                        must be disappointed to have me replace her&mdash;me who would much rather be in my head or in
                        front
                        of a canvas. They tell my parents how proud they should be of her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be a doctor in no time,‚Äù these customers say fondly. Then they look
                        significantly at me. ‚ÄúAnd maybe you can be the same.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Perhaps in other families it would have worked out. I mean, me and Evie are
                        only
                        two years apart, but if anyone didn‚Äôt know better, we might as well have been raised under two
                        separate households.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Mentioning that I want to major in anything remotely creative? Impossible. Back
                        in
                        freshman year, when the idea of doing something with art just came into mind, we had a regular
                        who
                        had one daughter who couldn‚Äôt be more perfect. Straight As, active in everything in her life,
                        her
                        hair always in a perfect bun. She was also one of the best seniors on the dance team and
                        naturally
                        decided to major in dance at college. Supposedly, the dad was more lenient, hence why she was
                        even
                        allowed to, I don‚Äôt know, <i class="calibre5">live</i> after announcing her decision. Her
                        mother‚Äôs
                        reaction, though, stays with me: ‚ÄúI want to die sometimes! She‚Äôll be poor her entire life. It‚Äôll
                        never work out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And my mom just consoled her as if she had lost a child, agreeing with every
                        word.
                        The woman and her daughter used to be close; now the girl‚Äôs a choreographer and rarely comes
                        home.
                        Whenever her mom drops by the restaurant, loneliness comes o her in waves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now I glance around the restaurant, my eyes landing on the familiar parts that
                        make
                        up a place that‚Äôs been like a second home for years: our red shrine greeting customers; our
                        private
                        shrine in the back room, where the ceiling is black with soot after so many years of joss sticks
                        lit
                        for worship; the people who come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, people from way back,
                        like
                        M·∫π and Ba‚Äôs refugee camp days, who apparently remember everything about me as a child, even if I
                        don‚Äôt remember them. I mix them up half the time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Nothing is bad. Nothing is <i class="calibre5">wrong</i>, really.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But it doesn‚Äôt feel enough. There‚Äôs something urging me to go a bit farther
                        than
                        here. Am I just being sel sh?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-17" class="calibre12">Ali has gotten up to stretch her legs. She stands by the
                        window with Ba and has started talking to him. Leave it to her to talk to someone who doesn‚Äôt
                        like
                        to talk unless he has reason to. O -and-on charisma. Ali laughs at something, but Ba looks
                        serious.
                        I leave my sketch and join them, curious.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI can always sneak in, you know. Pose as a customer and steal some recipes.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba doesn‚Äôt answer right away. It even looks like he‚Äôs considering. I roll my
                        eyes.
                        ‚ÄúBa, no way.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Anything the Nguy·ªÖns do, we have to do better. They knock down their <i
                            class="calibre5">ch·∫£ gi√≤</i> price to four dollars for two rolls, we have to do three
                        dollars
                        and fty cents for the same number of egg rolls. They have ve flavors of <i class="calibre5">sinh

                    <p class="calibre15">flavors. I‚Äôm never sure who‚Äôs winning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My parents are still trying to catch up to the others in the area, like the
                        Nguy·ªÖns, still cognizant of how hard it was to open a new restaurant in the place of one that
                        had,
                        for all purposes, looked successful.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I remember B√°c Xu√¢n, the previous owner, coming over to our old San Jose
                        apartment
                        whenever he had a free weekend&mdash;stopping by after seeing his only daughter and his four
                        grandchildren. The oldest, Fay, is getting married later this fall. I remember the slow way he‚Äôd
                        shu
                        ed inside and given a satis ed sigh as he sunk into our only comfortable La-Z-Boy chair. He told
                        my
                        parents he wanted to retire and that his daughter, a coworker of my mom‚Äôs from a nail salon
                        where
                        she used to work, would rave about my mom‚Äôs ph·ªü.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">If you make good ph·ªü, you can open this restaurant</i>,
                        he‚Äôd
                        said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Things happened so quickly after that. We moved. I transferred schools. The
                        restaurant opened‚Ä¶ and suddenly I was only a few feet away from that boy who‚Äôd asked me to draw
                        him
                        a Spider-Man. It would have been a good coincidence, and I could have made a friend&mdash;if
                        only it
                        wasn‚Äôt made clear that I should never step near their place.</p>

                        but
                        not. In four years of high school, with more than 2,500 students, we haven‚Äôt had one class
                        together.
                        As if our school administrators know of the rivalry and have conspired to keep us apart.</p>

                        it
                        in my backpack, rustling the paper tucked inside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ms. Yamamoto gave me that yer two days ago. It‚Äôs for an exhibition at the Asian
                        Art
                        Museum that will only be there for one night and morning. Chang Dai-Chien‚Äôs piece will be
                        displayed,
                        donated by his living family members. He‚Äôd been one of the rst to elevate ink painting and
                        traveled
                        all around the world before focusing on perfecting the art of Buddhist paintings. Yamamoto
                        thought
                        I‚Äôd be interested. She‚Äôs always telling me how it seems I like capturing memories &mdash;rather
                        than
                        something posed&mdash;in my artwork.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJust check it out,‚Äù she said, as class was letting out. I was already late for
                        work and ran out the door after grabbing the yer with a quick thanks. But as I looked at it on
                        the
                        walk from La Quinta, I knew I couldn‚Äôt miss out on it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π disappears, then returns from the kitchen with her own bowl of ph·ªü. She
                        likes to
                        eat before the dinner rush. My insides sigh at the smell: star anise, cinnamon, the earthy tones
                        of
                        chicken and beef bones. She dresses it with shredded thai basil and fresh bean sprouts, a spritz
                        of
                        lime here and there, and</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">finishes it with a generous swirl of hoisin sauce, glossy under our lights. A
                        work</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">of art.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBeautiful, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She inhales, a small smile on her face. M·∫π‚Äôs loud when
                        she‚Äôs
                        cooking&mdash;and she‚Äôs happiest when she‚Äôs eating. And I love her for it. I always want her to
                        stay
                        this way.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She gets sad sometimes&mdash;mornings when she doesn‚Äôt let the sun in, leaving
                        the
                        window shades closed so that only slivers of yellow peek through. She buries her head in her
                        pillow,
                        both temples dotted with dabs of <i class="calibre5">d√†u xanh</i> to soothe her headache. I hate
                        the
                        smell. It reminds me of sickness and tummy aches, because that‚Äôs what they used on me as a kid.
                        Ba
                        cooks on these days. Dinner is always a simple <i class="calibre5">canh s∆∞·ªùn b√≠</i>, which
                        always
                        has less salt than it should, and never measures up to M·∫π‚Äôs cooking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs worst whenever it hits the anniversary of her escape in 1983 or when a
                        relative‚Äôs death anniversary is just around the corner. M·∫π‚Äôs story about her boat escape to the
                        Philippines is the stu of nightmares. I grew up listening to these tales. I‚Äôm not sure
                        why&mdash;a
                        lesson, maybe? Like in a <i class="calibre5">hey, listen to the hell I went through so you can
                            have
                            a good life</i> kind of way. But should an eight-year-old have dreams about a pitch-black
                        sea
                        and a boat packed with thirty-nine people, including crying, starving babies?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-20" class="calibre12">It‚Äôs not depression, I don‚Äôt think. Sometimes, she checks
                        out.
                        That‚Äôs all. Like she‚Äôs remembering something and can‚Äôt get it out of her mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It helps when she calls my aunt, her older sister by six years, the one who
                        stayed
                        behind in Vietnam. She‚Äôd planned to escape with my mom in tow, along with their older cousins.
                        But
                        the officials had gotten to her, so she pushed my mom ahead, trusting their cousins from there
                        on.
                        They eventually made it to a camp in Palawan, Phillipines. My aunt wasn‚Äôt held back in Vietnam
                        for
                        long, and might have bribed her way out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But she understood then that she wouldn‚Äôt be as lucky the second time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π says I remind her of D√¨ V√†ng because we both like to draw and sketch. My
                        aunt
                        had visited us when we lived in San Jose. I was ve. I remember thinking she was like a colorful
                        painting come to life, and when I saw a Kandinsky painting in my sophomore-year art theory
                        class&mdash;one of his <i class="calibre5">Compositions&mdash;</i>I thought: <i
                            class="calibre5">This is her</i>. Kandinsky had always talked about a connection between
                        himself
                        and the viewer, how the role of the artist was to not only excite the senses but trigger the
                        viewer‚Äôs soul. Colors and soul&mdash;I saw that in my aunt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When my mom and my aunt get on the phone, I know things will be okay. They took
                        care of each other back in Vietnam&mdash;since my grandparents had passed away when my mom was
                        eleven&mdash;and they still take care of each other now. The almost nine thousand miles between
                        them
                        is insignificant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π smiles as a young couple comes in&mdash;Vietnamese, by the way she greets
                        them.
                        Ba shows them to a table. Charisma on. He‚Äôs already pushing the upcoming ph·ªü deal by handing out
                        my
                        yer along with the menu. Dad‚Äôs latest marketing scheme might work, but it‚Äôs going to be hell
                        working
                        during those nights. It will track in a bunch of other Vietnamese people, who were trained by
                        their
                        chopstick-wielding mothers to eat what‚Äôs in front of them, <i class="calibre5">then</i> eat some
                        more even if they‚Äôre full.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The sight of the yer tickles something in the back of my mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhen is it again?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">Until three weeks ago, we were down three waiters and waitresses. Julia,
                        Kingston,
                        and Huy were a grade above me and left for college. But to say that the new workers were making
                        things easier would be a complete lie. Jonathan was just okay. Lisa, the hostess, gets flustered
                        too
                        easily. And T√†i has slippery</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">fingers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I lean back in my chair. Some of the air in the padding squeezes out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Of course it‚Äôs September thirtieth. The same day as the exhibition.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIs Evie coming back to help?‚Äù My sister texted the other day and sent me a

                        string of pictures of her dorm room, a sel e with her new roommate, and a sunrise view of the
                        campus
                        after a morning run.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Maybe if she comes back, she can help out like she used to and I can sneak
                        out.‚Ä¶

                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π sighs as she mixes up her ph·ªü. ‚ÄúI know this is not the best situation. I

                        Astronomy, the easiest class any senior can take, was already filled up. Vi·ªát was lucky enough
                        to get

                        but doesn‚Äôt. Even though this is our rst journalism class, Allison‚Äôs already expecting us to
                        chase
                        news stories from things like the chess team embezzling money from their joint fundraiser with
                        the
                        checkers team&mdash;how Allison sni ed that lead out, I‚Äôm not even sure.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The adviser, Ben Rowan, should step in more often, but he seems more like a
                        glorified babysitter. Rowan lets Allison run everything on the newspaper. He‚Äôs the kind of guy
                        who looks
                        like he says ‚Äúsorry‚Äù a lot.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre at the tail end of our editorial meeting about assignment statuses. I
                        take
                        the back seat at this meeting and try not to fall asleep, since it‚Äôs the end of the school day.
                        But
                        a part of me is still recovering from being accosted by theater nerds at the club fair during
                        lunch
                        period. Traumatic. They were demonstrating some circle game in the quad, but to me, it looked
                        like
                        they were trying to summon demons. Other clubs were less intimidating. Apparently there‚Äôs a new
                        TikTok club? I even managed to dodge the Vietnamese Student Association.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre12">The president, Kelly Tran, still hasn‚Äôt forgiven me for
                        oversleeping and missing one Saturday service day during sophomore year. Actually, it was three.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The newspaper room used to be an art room, so the walls have posters about
                        journalism ethics and one blow-up portrait of a younger Woodward and Bernstein posing
                        together&mdash;not sure where that came from&mdash;but also a deep sink with an annoying drip
                        and
                        leftover jugs of neon green and yellow paint from last semester. Macs surround the perimeter of
                        the
                        room, all asleep. I‚Äôm basically silent because I don‚Äôt have anything to show. I forgot my
                        article
                        about upcoming school eld trips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Kind of.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The truth is, I started to write it. I really did. I‚Äôd talked to the people
                        Allison
                        told me to seek out: the bus drivers, the teachers, and some random students that she found
                        somewhere, and I jotted down everything they had to say&mdash; nothing interesting, of course.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But the moment I started to type them out during the last class, my words
                        stopped
                        making sense. I remember thinking in that moment: <i class="calibre5">What‚Äôs the</i> point<i
                            class="calibre5">? Will anyone read this?</i> Then my words and sentences froze onscreen
                        until
                        nothing was coming out, and I was stuck trying to nd a way to string them together into
                        something
                        remotely reasonable.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Meanwhile, everyone around me was zoned in, typing without pause, putting their
                        stories into those ‚Äúpyramids‚Äù or whatever that Rowan had taught us when we rst started classes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So I say that I ‚Äúforgot‚Äù my article, and Rowan just sighs&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Did he just write</i> Loser <i class="calibre5">on his
                            pad?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Honestly, I don‚Äôt know where Allison gets her energy from. What does she eat?
                        What
                        did her parents <i class="calibre5">do</i> to her? She stands at the center of the desks, which
                        are
                        ush against each other in a perfect square. She‚Äôs more like a lion at the zoo looking out at
                        gawkers. Her hair is in a braid. I think of Katniss Everdeen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She squints at me. Of course she knows that I lied, that I actually hate
                        writing.
                        Why isn‚Äôt she saying anything? I squirm. I see her at school with Linh in the hallways. What if
                        Linh
                        talks about me or my family&mdash;and what stories has she heard? Maybe she and the rest of the
                        Mais
                        throw darts at pictures of us. That could explain why Allison looks like she‚Äôs devising a way to
                        meticulously murder me and stash my body.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre12">‚ÄúFine. Since you don‚Äôt have anything to write about, I‚Äôm
                        putting you on proofreading duty. Do you have an <i class="calibre5">AP Stylebook</i>?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shake my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Smack</i>. Allison tosses me a tome that lands on my desk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Fingerprints smear the glossy front cover. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I mumble. Awesome. All
                        I‚Äôve
                        ever edited was our restaurant menu where the letter <i class="calibre5">s</i> mysteriously
                        dropped
                        from plural nouns. I just added them back in if I thought they looked weird.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Finally, Allison‚Äôs focus shifts to another kid named Ernie, who smells like
                        wintergreen gum even though he never chews gum. He fiddles with his round glasses that are down
                        to his
                        nose. Looking at him makes me feel anxious.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúErnie, you‚Äôre two days late with the article on the recycling scandal. Where
                        is
                        it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMr. Allen hasn‚Äôt gotten back to me.‚Äù From what I remember, Mr. Allen, the
                        marine
                        biology teacher, was caught putting trash into his recycling bin&mdash;by Allison herself.
                        That‚Äôs a
                        ‚Äúscandal,‚Äù apparently.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Allison sighs. ‚ÄúDid you talk to him?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI e-mailed him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI want you to chase him, okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúO-okay,‚Äù he stutters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWait for his class to let out. Show him that I have proof that he broke the
                        rules.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHang on, Allison, you saved the contents of a <i class="calibre5">recycling
                            bin</i>?‚Äù Rowan interjects.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She looks confused. ‚ÄúYes, why?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Is she for real?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Rowan starts laughing but he hides it behind a cough. ‚ÄúGood. A journalist
                        always
                        needs to back up their claims.‚Äù He shakes his sleeve up to show his wristwatch. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we
                        finish
                        the meeting now and get right into it? B·∫£o, here‚Äôs something for you to start proofreading. Try
                        to
                        nish it.‚Äù He o ers me a manila folder, which I get up and take.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-25" class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Try?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Asshole.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We still have more than a half hour left and Rowan doesn‚Äôt think I can get
                        through
                        a ve-hundred-word article. Oblivious to the insult, he retreats into his o ce abutting the
                        newsroom.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Allison pushes away a desk with her hip, creating an exit. She pulls aside
                        Luigi,
                        the managing editor, so she can come up with a way to ll what used to be the comics section.
                        Apparently the comics artist showed up to one class, was given an assignment by Allison, and
                        then
                        switched over to graphic design class.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I dive into Allison‚Äôs article about bullying issues and how our statistics
                        compare
                        to nationwide statistics. She knows how to write, knows when she‚Äôs said enough, knows when to
                        punch
                        the details. She‚Äôs good. She quotes Hal, the janitor who‚Äôs one of the main advocates for
                        stronger
                        anti-bullying policies because he sees it happening all the time in the hallways, and Allison
                        writes
                        him so well that it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs right there in the room, leaning against his mop, a watchful eye
                        on
                        bullies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I only x a few commas and start a new paragraph when one of them looks too
                        long. At
                        the last sentence, though, I stop. I read the sentence over and over again and it just feels‚Ä¶
                        weird
                        to me. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, so I let my pen linger there, a red dot bleeding through the
                        page.
                        But still, it‚Äôs one word. One word won‚Äôt ruin a piece. And Allison‚Äôs probably not going to like
                        the
                        fact that I‚Äôm questioning&mdash;even if it‚Äôs a small bit&mdash;her article.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The hallway bell dismisses us, thankfully. Allison is yelling out the next
                        deadline
                        for articles. When she walks past me, I hand back her article.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really good.‚Äù Then I‚Äôm free, but not really, since I have work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWait.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I turn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying.‚Äù She peers at the paper‚Ä¶ at the red dot that I left. ‚ÄúYou
                        hesitated
                        here. Why?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs unnerving to see a girl my age use the same withering glance as my mom.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat do you mean, you don‚Äôt know?‚Äù she demands.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-26" class="calibre12">Now she‚Äôs annoying me. I snatch the paper back and stab at
                        the
                        paper. ‚ÄúMaybe cut this word and replace it with an adjective. I just think you need a stronger
                        one.
                        Plus the word is repeated earlier in the article.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A long pause falls between us. I swear I hear the clock ticking. <i
                            class="calibre5">Did I just say that?</i> ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Allison says. She looks like she‚Äôs
                        trying
                        not to grimace.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I grab my things. My adrenaline‚Äôs pumping, like I just nished a mile. I feel
                        good&mdash;being right about something for once.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm the only one left in the room, so I leave‚Ä¶ before running into someone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù a girl says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, no that‚Äôs ne.‚Äù My mouth feels numb. I can‚Äôt nd any other words to say
                        because
                        of the way she‚Äôs looking at me, wide-eyed, indecisive&mdash;everything that I‚Äôm probably feeling
                        right now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I do the only thing I can think of:</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúHey, what are you doing here?‚Äù Ali asks as she leaves room 436 with her
                        backpack.
                        Strands of her hair have escaped her braid, but she hurriedly brushes them aside. I didn‚Äôt
                        expect to
                        see her because I knew she had study hall; she should be home right now, which makes me jealous
                        even
                        thinking about it. I would have given anything to have a break before going to work. A time
                        where I
                        can just think and not be around people, like I am all day.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGrabbing paint for Yamamoto,‚Äù I tell Ali. When I‚Äôd gotten to the studio
                        upstairs,
                        she shouted from the back, asking me to drop by the old art room downstairs because she left
                        behind
                        a few things during the move.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Thinking everyone had emptied from the room by now, I walk through the door‚Ä¶
                        until
                        I collide with B·∫£o. His eyes widen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Why do I sound like a squeaky rst grader? He‚Äôs a head taller than me, which
                        shouldn‚Äôt surprise me&mdash;puberty and all&mdash;but having always seen him across the street
                        from
                        the restaurant, I never noticed his height.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, no that‚Äôs ne.‚Äù He slips past me, then nearly bolts down the hallway, away
                        from
                        us. Away from me. Which shouldn‚Äôt bother me so much, since I would probably do the same in his
                        shoes, but it does. I glance at Allison to see if she noticed the weird exchange&mdash;she
                        usually
                        does with things like this&mdash;but surprisingly, she‚Äôs watching B·∫£o, looking like she has
                        something to say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I like that kid.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB·∫£o?‚Äù I spot the canary-yellow paint by the sink and grab it while Allison
                        talks

                        give a

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, wow, he found a <i class="calibre5">mistake</i>,‚Äù I say mockingly. We walk
                        down the hall together, toward the art room. With school letting out at the end of the day, it‚Äôs
                        chaotic. Elbows and shoulders crash against me, and the smells of Axe, sweat, and sweet
                        Victoria‚Äôs
                        Secret perfume hit me all at once. Loud rap and pop music</p>

                        the feud in general, how it doesn‚Äôt really make sense and all that, but I‚Äôve never really
                        mentioned
                        B·∫£o. Or our time at the temple together. Some things aren‚Äôt worth mentioning; they sound and

                        I smile. I knew it; even if she didn‚Äôt react in the moment, of course she‚Äôd catch that. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs
                        a

                    <p class="calibre12">Good? She doesn‚Äôt explain why. ‚ÄúOne minute you say you hate him&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúObviously you‚Äôre not listening. I said I don‚Äôt <i class="calibre5">know</i> if
                        I

                    <p class="calibre1">Yamamoto‚Äôs room is a forest of easels, with white canvases of all sizes, their
                        pictures all works-in-progress. This side of the school gets the best lighting, not only for
                        drawing, but also for feeding the hanging plants by the windows. Yamamoto is closer to the back
                        and
                        sits cross-legged on a stool, yet manages to look completely relaxed. Her nose practically
                        touching
                        the canvas, she dabs whatever she‚Äôs working on with a wet sponge. She has a streak of
                        forest-green
                        paint on her cheek.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-29" class="calibre12">A tattooed Asian wasn‚Äôt a familiar concept growing up, so
                        meeting someone like her was so cool. She‚Äôs not posing, either; the tattoos t her. She can say
                        the
                        word ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù in a classroom without a problem.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHere you go,‚Äù I say, handing her the jug.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAh, perfect. Canary yellow, just what I need.‚Äù She sets it down on the ground.
                        ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs my old lair lookin‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWeird to see all the computers there. And the room looks smaller.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I think too. You know, even though I complained a lot last
                        semester,
                        the move was actually a good thing. Look at all the space!‚Äù She opens her arms wide. I laugh
                        because
                        I love it when she smiles. Not that she‚Äôs so serious in class, even if she has the authority to
                        be.
                        But when it‚Äôs just us, she acts like an older sister&mdash;sans the weird, unnecessary
                        biological
                        facts Evie likes to point out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She claps her hands together. ‚ÄúOkay. Give it here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I let her see my homework assignment again. I ended up finishing it after work,
                        at
                        midnight. That‚Äôs when I usually do my art&mdash;with a desk lamp as my only light source and
                        bass-heavy electronica thrumming in my ears. It makes me feel peaceful and zoned in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo are you going to the exhibition?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Left turn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She sets down my sketchpad and I follow the movement. Suddenly the conversation
                        is
                        turning to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAt the museum I mentioned. It‚Äôd be good for you. You should really go.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUm, yeah. I think I will.‚Äù I bite my lip at the lie.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour parents don‚Äôt know, do they.‚Äù A statement, not a question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The yer that I made oats back into my mind, September thirtieth haunting me. I
                        sigh. ‚ÄúNo. I still haven‚Äôt asked my parents.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Yamamoto knows a bit about my family and what it‚Äôs like to work at a
                        restaurant,
                        since she‚Äôs lived some of it. Her mother owned a Japanese fusion restaurant for half of her
                        childhood before retiring. But because her parents were also artists on the side, she can‚Äôt
                        truly
                        relate to my dilemma.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-30" class="calibre12">I lean in on my elbows, listening as she continues with
                        her
                        critique. Yamamoto shares the same language as me. No one else in my life can teach me about
                        light
                        and shadow and how they fall on objects. Ba‚Äôs unlikely to sit still long enough to watch
                        shadows.
                        He‚Äôd only think of it as wasting time. <i class="calibre5">‚ÄúBa kh√¥ng c√≥ th√¨ gi·ªù!‚Äù</i> Which is
                        actually his usual excuse for things he‚Äôd rather avoid doing, like xing something broken at home
                        or
                        running errands for the restaurant. My mom <i class="calibre5">loves</i> that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And the few times I‚Äôve talked about art class with my mom, there‚Äôs some words
                        and
                        feelings that I can‚Äôt translate into Vietnamese. Like, orange is <i class="calibre5">m√†u
                            cam</i>,
                        but then there‚Äôs also burnt orange and cider orange. Direct translations don‚Äôt work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My phone vibrates in my pocket, bursting the bubble ensconcing me and Yamamoto.
                        ‚ÄúUgh, sorry, I‚Äôm late for work.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, but wait.‚Äù Yamamoto crosses the room to her desk and removes a packet
                        from
                        her drawer. ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôve mentioned this before, but I wanted to make sure you don‚Äôt forget about
                        it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The Scholastic Awards. Each year, high school students submit their best works
                        in
                        art and writing. There are local awards, then there are national ones called Gold Keys, judged
                        by
                        the best in the business, and the winner gets recognition at Carnegie Hall in New York, and even
                        some scholarships.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you. Keep your eye on this. You have a chance.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">Yamamoto smiles. ‚ÄúAbsolutely. And, hey, maybe it‚Äôll help your parents see the
                        value
                        in what you‚Äôre doing. They can‚Äôt say no to money. But rst step: Just make sure you check out the
                        exhibition, okay? I know you have a lot of things riding on you, but I don‚Äôt want you to forget
                        about yourself. About what <i class="calibre5">you</i> want. This is <i

                        each
                        ticket failed to yield winning numbers, they placed it in a pile that goes into the ‚Äúeverything

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π, that‚Äôs, like, a year away.‚Äù</p>

                        made
                        Allison shut up for once. I haven‚Äôt felt this way before.</p>

                        stares at him reproachfully, probably hoping he‚Äôll say something more inspiring.</p>

                        though it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue with him. The kid doesn‚Äôt study and has probably never studied,

                    <p class="calibre12">I duck my head, eating the last bit of <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>, and
                        feeling like the biggest asshole. But low blow, using her escape story. I can‚Äôt really say
                        anything
                        in response to that. How can I, when she mentioned everything she‚Äôd lost? Her home, plenty of
                        relatives&mdash;including her older brother, who attempted escape before her, but died during
                        the
                        passage.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-34" class="calibre12">In rare moments, she would say that I look like him, like
                        C·∫≠u
                        Cam. We have the same hair, she says. I can tell how much it hurts her to mention him because
                        she
                        either goes silent or quickly moves on to mention something else. I never know what to say when
                        that
                        happens.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Before my mom goes on to talk about her night of the escape&mdash;the last
                        recitation having been one hour and forty minutes long&mdash;I relent with an ‚ÄúOkay. Okay. I
                        promise
                        I‚Äôll focus.‚Äù I breathe in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do better.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π brightens and shares a look with Ba, her guilt trip a success. It‚Äôs like I
                        solved all her worries&mdash;past, present, and future. ‚ÄúYou can be anything!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe a doctor,‚Äù my dad o ers, nally edging a word in.</p>

                            class="calibre5">No? Why? It wasn‚Äôt good enough?</i> I relent and tell her maybe a few
                        pieces of

                        morning to receive Vi·ªát‚Äôs parents‚Äô delivery, so the alarm needs to be set. Ba tells her to stop
                        reminding him: <i class="calibre5">B√† n√≥i ƒëi·∫øc l·ªó tai</i>. Which only means she‚Äôll continue to
                        pester him to purposefully get on his nerves. Her type of revenge.

                    <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">One of my earliest memories of learning Vietnamese at home and at the temple
                        with
                        other kids has to do with a traditional folk poem. If I close my eyes, I‚Äôm back in that basement
                        room, surrounded by our teacher‚Äôs singsong voice, loud over the overhead ceiling fans fighting o
                        a
                        July heat: <i class="calibre5">C√¥ng cha nh∆∞ n√∫i Th√°i S∆°n / Nghƒ©a m·∫π nh∆∞ n∆∞·ªõc trong ngu·ªïn ch·∫£y
                            ra‚Ä¶</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I was more enthralled by the image that went with the folk poem: a towering,
                        majestic mountain wrapped inside a delicate fog. Father. A pool of glistening water gushing from
                        the
                        same mountain. Mother. The next lines talked of honoring their labor and love; the lesson was
                        clear
                        enough: Everything I do is in their reflection.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now alone in my bedroom, I lie at on my back, staring at the ceiling fan
                        turning at
                        the slowest speed possible no matter how far right I turn the knob. I thought the room would
                        feel
                        more spacious since I wasn‚Äôt sharing with Evie anymore, as I‚Äôve done for sixteen years. That I
                        can
                        decorate however I want, make it however messy I want. But my body became used to another person
                        in
                        the room, and any desire to rearrange things is forgotten.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Anyone walking in would see two distinct personalities&mdash;one wall
                        immaculately
                        decorated with cute thrift-shop nds&mdash;Evie can sni out discounts like no one else‚Äôs
                        business. My
                        side, while it might be just as clean, holds years of my artwork, no rhyme or reason to the
                        colors,
                        from drawings showing my childhood obsession with goats and llamas, to my more recent work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">On my Picasso desk calendar, I marked the thirtieth but somehow didn‚Äôt mark Ph·ªü
                        Day. I trace it with my finger&mdash;it‚Äôs not the end of the world if I don‚Äôt go. I know that.
                        But am
                        I giving something up? Missing out?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-36" class="calibre12">I sit up quickly and my vision spins. Sometimes when I
                        think
                        too much, I make myself sadder, which doesn‚Äôt help at all. I nd refuge in art, escaping thoughts
                        like this, to regain control when life throws another obstacle my way. When I work, magic
                        happens;
                        for a few hours at a time, the world just slips away. I don‚Äôt have to listen to customers
                        comparing
                        me to Evie. Any worries about upcoming tests or working a shift at the restaurant&mdash;that all
                        takes second place in my mind. My attention fixates on an image or an idea that doesn‚Äôt exist
                        just
                        yet, and can‚Äôt exist without me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I rst saw art in action when my family and I took a trip to Huntington Beach.
                        We
                        were walking along the boardwalk; I was still young, because I remember holding my mom‚Äôs hand
                        when
                        <i class="calibre5">it</i> happened. A small crowd had formed, a sketch artist ensconced inside,
                        his
                        canvas before him. His muse, a little boy, sat in a chair, feet dangling. The boy tried and
                        failed
                        to look serious as the artist captured his likeness on the canvas. He kept grinning at his
                        parents.
                        It was only ve bucks for a portrait, yet the artist treated him like the most important being in
                        the
                        world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I stayed there the entire time, counting the artist‚Äôs deliberate strokes. My
                        mom
                        waited alongside me, half interested and half ready to move. We would have if only we hadn‚Äôt
                        reached
                        the end of the boardwalk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The artist‚Äôs still there these days, though his hands look more shriveled and
                        sun-spotted than they did over a decade ago.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I breathe out, letting go of my memories, replacing my thoughts with a nicer
                        reality: <i class="calibre5">Maybe no one will show up and I won‚Äôt need to work that night.
                            Maybe my
                            parents will be in such a good mood that they‚Äôll let me go.</i> Their moods are always good
                        indicators of whether or not I can do anything. <i class="calibre5">This is your year</i>,
                        Yamamoto‚Äôs voice says in my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm choosing to believe that can be true.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Our home has only one oor, with a long hallway connected to each room. I pad
                        lightly
                        across the tiled oor to the opposite end, where M·∫π and Ba‚Äôs room sits.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre12">At the door, I hear only whispers. I‚Äôm seven again,
                        eavesdropping on my parents like I used to with Evie. Evie would be right across from me,
                        mouthing,
                        <i class="calibre5">What are they saying?</i> because she was never the stealthy type, didn‚Äôt
                        have
                        good hearing, and completely sucked at reading lips. Through the slit of the door, I see my
                        father
                        lying prone, shirt o . In the morning, he‚Äôs usually half naked, baring his stomach, and wakes up
                        before everyone else, then shu es through each room, lifting up all the window blinds.
                    </p>

                        him
                        in Vietnamese. I lean back against the wall, out of view.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHmm? One of our cooks? They can barely lift anything. I‚Äôm the only one who
                        lifts
                        things back there.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe only one,‚Äù M·∫π repeats sarcastically. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba, ever the stubborn one, answers, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He hisses as she slathers Bengay on
                        his
                        back. She then tells him calmly that if he keeps complaining, she‚Äôll actually break his back. I
                        hide
                        a smile even if I don‚Äôt have to. Ba stems his protests and M·∫π takes o her gloves. I hear her go
                        into
                        the bathroom, the creak of the mirror as she puts back the Bengay.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWill we need to hire someone for the day?‚Äù Her voice echoes. ‚ÄúI can ask
                        Duy-Loan‚Äôs
                        cousin to work.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He doesn‚Äôt answer right away, as if he‚Äôs waiting for her words to subside. ‚ÄúWe
                        have
                        Linh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He says my name like I‚Äôm the solution. A ash of anger courses through me. Why
                        do I
                        always have to be the solution?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou know we can‚Äôt a ord more people,‚Äù Ba continues. ‚ÄúI think it will be</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">ne. I can still help.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Wait. What does he mean?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIf you say so.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">They haven‚Äôt told me about any financial problems. My stomach drops as I
                        remember how
                        anxious my mom looked yesterday, the hope in her voice that the special will work. Of course.
                        But
                        then I remember they wouldn‚Äôt have told me something like this. They don‚Äôt want me to worry
                        about
                        things that <i class="calibre5">they‚Äôre</i> supposed to be worried about. Typical.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-38" class="calibre12">Later, sitting down for dinner at the kitchen table, I
                        smell
                        the Bengay, but Ba doesn‚Äôt complain, only winces as he slowly sits down at the head of the
                        table. I
                        slide over our bowls, which M·∫π just filled with rice&mdash;mine full to the brim, while hers is
                        half.
                        She eats the side dishes more than the rice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">M·ªùi Ba ƒÉn c∆°m. M·ªùi M·∫π ƒÉn c∆°m</i>,‚Äù I say before we start
                        eating.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We don‚Äôt immediately talk, each of us lost in our thoughts. Our chopsticks ding
                        the
                        sides of our bowls. The waves of steam from the <i class="calibre5">canh chua</i> rise up,
                        swirled
                        away by the ceiling fan. It‚Äôs one of my favorite dishes&mdash;sour soup, but not the kind sold
                        in
                        Asian restaurants. It‚Äôs made sweet from pineapple chunks, and balanced out with simmering
                        tomatoes
                        and tamarind. M·∫π asks if I want more cat sh. I shake my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I swallow a clump of rice and muster as much eagerness into my voice as I can.
                        ‚ÄúPh·ªü
                        Day will be fun.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">By Saturday, Ba‚Äôs back problems are worse, and now he can barely move. M·∫π and I
                        leave around noon to start prepping for the rush, but before we do, M·∫π reminds Ba not to do
                        anything
                        too strenuous. Ba lies across the living room couch, TV remote in hand, which is his preferred
                        state
                        whenever he has time o , but he wants to work tonight. As much pain as he‚Äôs in, he‚Äôs still
                        thinking
                        about the restaurant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Mom‚Äôs having none of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He continues his protest in Vietnamese. ‚ÄúNo, you need me tonight. Who‚Äôs working
                        the
                        stand?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLisa.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba snorts. ‚ÄúLisa! She doesn‚Äôt know how to do anything!‚Äù Lisa‚Äôs been working for
                        us
                        for three weeks, a replacement for the outgoing seniors.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π answers, ‚ÄúBa say that about her all the time. And Jonathan&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúEveryone, basically,‚Äù I mumble. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre the one who hired them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba just glares. He lies back down, staring at the ceiling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut what if something goes wrong?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre12">My entire morning was spent alone in my room, preparing
                        myself
                        for tonight‚Äôs rush. I was so tense that I couldn‚Äôt concentrate, couldn‚Äôt even sketch in my note
                        pad
                        or pick up a brush. Ba complaining throughout the house didn‚Äôt help things.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Yet now, I hear the genuine worry in his voice, the worry that everything he
                        had
                        masterminded would undo itself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π pats his head as she passes by, keys in hand. <i class="calibre5">‚Äúƒê·ª´ng
                            lo.‚Äù</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The simple truth is that he can‚Äôt get up; all three of us know this. He falls
                        silent. Or more accurately, M·∫π silences him by shutting out any response with the front door.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">One thing that people forget when they‚Äôre yelling at waiters or complaining
                        about
                        meal prices is the realities of how much prep goes into the menu. It‚Äôs hours. I learned that the
                        hard way when I was young, hanging out in the kitchen, waiting for M·∫π to be done because she
                        said
                        she was ‚Äúonly doing prep.‚Äù <i class="calibre5">Only doing</i>. No. That meant watching the
                        outside
                        go from incandescent yellow to midnight blue with specks of white from the street lamps. But it
                        was
                        fun back then. I always had my crayons with me. The waiters and line cooks took their turns
                        watching
                        after me or cooking up something sweet&mdash;caramelized plantains sort of became my drug. Evie
                        took
                        it upon herself to re ll all of the hoisin bottles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now in the kitchen, my mom has two large pots cooking on the stovetop, all
                        containing the broth for tonight. Four small pots sit on the prep table, ready to be reheated
                        once
                        the orders come through. M·∫π strides with purpose in the kitchen while the other line cooks chop
                        green onions, limes, and jalape√±o peppers, and wash bean sprouts and Thai basil that makes the
                        anise
                        in the ph·ªü broth pop even more. It‚Äôs all a rhythm; they follow the beat set by M·∫π because
                        they‚Äôve
                        done this for forever. She‚Äôs the most methodical in the kitchen, though whatever method she uses
                        here can‚Äôt be replicated or measured. It‚Äôs instinctive. My art and her cooking are kind of the
                        same,
                        when I think about it. Our hands move before our brains. But I never say this out loud, because
                        the
                        retort would be: ‚ÄúBut will it support you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-40" class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everyone on the outside?‚Äù she asks when she notices
                        me
                        watching by the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I double-knot my apron strings, then sweep my hair into a high ponytail. ‚ÄúGood.
                        Everything‚Äôs in place.‚Äù Servers are setting out the soup spoons, chopsticks, and sauces.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π wipes her forehead with the back of her gloved hands. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she repeats. I
                        wonder if she‚Äôs trying to make herself feel better about tonight. Like I am.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The rst wave of customers are young college students. Lisa greets them,
                        clumsily
                        grabbing the menus. I hope she can pull it together before the real challenge begins.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Within a half hour, our tables are booked and a line has formed, a sight that
                        would
                        make Ba giddy&mdash;as giddy as he can get, at least. Instead, my body pings with a sense of
                        foreboding. As I move to table six with plates of egg rolls, a chatty group of three passes by,
                        Jonathan leading the way. He mouths, <i class="calibre5">Help!</i> before plastering on a fake
                        smile
                        to the group, who seat themselves at table eight&mdash; which I‚Äôm sure is reserved.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I make a beeline toward the booth and sort through the table management system.
                        I‚Äôm
                        right. Lisa comes back from seating another group, playing with her hands. She does this when
                        she‚Äôs
                        nervous. ‚ÄúLisa, did you check the system just now?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTable eight. Someone had a reservation and we were going to seat them there.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Lisa glances down and blanches. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm <i class="calibre5">so</i> sorry, I didn‚Äôt
                        see
                        it!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I tamp down my instinct to shout, like Ba would. ‚ÄúJust nd a way to x it.‚Äù I
                        turn
                        sharply and control my breathing. It‚Äôs not my usual job to greet the guests, only serve them.
                        Lisa
                        will need to do it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Passing by table four, I see a little kid, age six or seven, reach for a bottle
                        of
                        hoisin while his mother chats with a friend. I summon the Mai and Ph·∫°m women‚Äôs stare&mdash;<i
                            class="calibre5">M√†y ƒëang l√†m g√¨?</i>&mdash;and the kid retracts his hand. As he should.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-41" class="calibre12">The sound of pots and pans from the kitchen grates on my
                        nerves, threatening to send a headache my way. But there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop it, so I
                        hand in
                        my orders, then circle back to the stand to make sure Lisa hasn‚Äôt messed up again&mdash;I can‚Äôt
                        help
                        it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">If possible, the line outside has gotten longer. More college students.
                        Families.
                        Couples. They stare back at me as I pop my head out, a sea of eyes reminding me of a surrealist
                        painting.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, excuse me, miss,‚Äù a guy wearing cargo shorts asks. He‚Äôs third in line.
                        ‚ÄúHow
                        long will it be until we‚Äôre seated?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAbout a half hour.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHalf hour, whoa.‚Äù He sends a look to his friend who stands behind him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I tamp down my annoyance as best I can. ‚ÄúAs you can see, it‚Äôs quite busy now.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThis is ridiculous,‚Äù he mutters to his friend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe apologize for the wait, but there‚Äôs nothing more we can do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs taking so long?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The. Nerve.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey! We‚Äôre having a special! So of course there will be a line!‚Äù I snap. The
                        guy
                        reels back for a second, rendered speechless. He‚Äôs too shocked to be angry. Before a mortified
                        apology can slip past my lips, Lisa sidles up to my side, taking control of things. She shoots
                        me a
                        concerned look and says a few things that I can‚Äôt make out. The fact that Lisa needs to save me
                        pisses me o even more.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I stalk back to the kitchen. Pine for the art exhibition. I pretend I‚Äôm there
                        right
                        now&mdash;me with other patrons. Whenever I‚Äôm at a museum, seeing the work of geniuses before
                        me, I
                        imagine a cloud of quiet reverence settling over me. In the room, there‚Äôs a bunch of people
                        looking
                        to art for answers, who examine pieces just to <i class="calibre5">feel</i> something.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">One day, I want to be that artist who sees this, who knows that what she
                        created
                        made them feel completely content, filling a void they didn‚Äôt know they were seeking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I want to be there‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-42" class="calibre12">‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm here. The ticket machine pushing out food orders
                        at
                        crank speed yanks me back into my reality. Its chirping will stay in my nightmares forever. From
                        the
                        dining room, Vietnamese, English, Spanish, and other languages and laughter swell up, crashing
                        into
                        me like a tsunami wave. The back room now feels like a sauna.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCon?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom pops her head out when she realizes no one‚Äôs picked up the three bowls
                        of

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJust one minute!‚Äù I say. Using my whole body, I push through the back door, my

                        ground might be dirty; it‚Äôs the best sanctuary I can nd in the moment. I slide down, bring my
                        legs
                        to my chest, and rest my forehead on my knees. <i class="calibre5">Breathe, Linh. Breathe.</i>

                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs always hard to work when your best friend is summarizing a rerun episode of
                        <i class="calibre5">Law &amp; Order: SVU.</i> Even when we‚Äôre not in the same area, Vi·ªát‚Äôs
                        shouting
                        across the room.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou always know it‚Äôs the good-looking celebrity guy who‚Äôs the perp.‚Äù He uses
                        the
                        term like he‚Äôs a well-seasoned cop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI just wish that for <i class="calibre5">one</i> episode, the perp would be
                        the
                        ugly one. You know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI mean, the <i class="calibre5">moment</i> John Stamos came on screen, I was
                        like&mdash;<i class="calibre5">hello</i>, it‚Äôs him. The bad guy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre running through our checklist of things to do at closing at ten, only a
                        few
                        minutes away. Cold items in the fridge. Cutting boards washed down, then turned over. Each
                        bottle of
                        hoisin and sriracha sauce filled. Eduardo, one of the line cooks, st-bumps me on his way out.
                        He‚Äôs
                        usually the last one to go and rst to show up every morning, on the dot. He sends me a rictus of
                        pity, having been on the receiving end of Vi·ªát‚Äôs recap before.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát has his quirks&mdash;his obsession with all the weirdest police procedural
                        or
                        forensic science shows and his near-perfect ability to quote the dialogue from them&mdash;but I
                        can‚Äôt imagine Vi·ªát without them. He‚Äôs been in my life for that long. His parents and mine would
                        get
                        together at the restaurant&mdash;mostly after the shift ended, or when Vi·ªát‚Äôs parents were done
                        delivering supplies to various restaurants&mdash;to unwind or rant about other store owners in
                        the
                        area. Heineken would come in at some point. While the adults talked, we‚Äôd sit underneath the
                        tables
                        trading imaginary stories&mdash;playing cops and robbers&mdash;sharing toys with each other.
                        Sometimes we didn‚Äôt even need to talk.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-44" class="calibre12">I thought him joining the cross-country team in freshman
                        year
                        would be the end of Vi·ªát and B·∫£o. That he would nd more coordinated friends who didn‚Äôt wheeze
                        after
                        running a quarter of a mile. But I was still his best friend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And as Vi·ªát launches into another recap, I think: <i class="calibre5">For
                            better or
                            for worse</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The night passed easily, the two of us having already established a rhythm with
                        the
                        other servers. M·∫π had put a line cook‚Äôs mom, Tr·∫ßn‚Äôs, in charge of the kitchen so she didn‚Äôt have
                        to
                        come in. It‚Äôs different with the server situation, though. She‚Äôs pairing me up with Vi·ªát because
                        we
                        know each other and make decent partners. She trusts Vi·ªát to do his job, as well as make sure I
                        do
                        mine. The concept‚Äôs not perfect: We‚Äôre the same age, and letting him watch over me makes as much
                        sense as letting a horse and a pony run the show. But somehow it works.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Tr·∫ßn‚Äôs mom leaves before us. I make sure the front is locked from the inside.
                        As
                        I‚Äôm closing the blinds, I see Linh‚Äôs place is packed with customers at ten. Just for today, for
                        that
                        special, it‚Äôs staying open for two more hours. A line wraps around the corner. Something that
                        I‚Äôm
                        sure our place has never seen before. I‚Äôm glad M·∫π is home tonight or else she‚Äôd come and just
                        sit
                        here and spy on people coming and going, scaring not only their customers but our own.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát joins me to peer through the blinds. ‚ÄúWhat people do for specials.‚Äù He
                        shakes
                        his head. ‚ÄúWe gotta one-up them, man.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúPut something special on the menu.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat else should we make?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát shrugs. ‚ÄúMom‚Äôs always telling me your mom makes the best <i
                            class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>&mdash; why not work with that? Like an
                        anything-you-want-in-your-crepe kind of deal. I mean, my mom has talked multiple times of
                        poisoning
                        her to get the recipe. Which could be effective, if you think about it, since your mom needs to
                        taste
                        a lot of things in the kitchen.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I glance over at my best friend. His mom‚Äôs known for being hawk-eyed and
                        competitive. She didn‚Äôt get to be one of the most sought-after suppliers by doing any favors.
                        But
                        poison?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát backtracks. ‚ÄúBut she won‚Äôt&mdash;you know, poison her. It was a joke.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-45" class="calibre12">I can‚Äôt ever imagine his mother&mdash;or his
                        father&mdash;joking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs appreciated,‚Äù I reply dryly. I almost drop my blinds. Then a blur
                        bursts
                        from the back door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh. She escapes into the alley. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù The customers waiting in
                        line
                        watch her go before facing frontward again&mdash;shrugging or just shaking their heads. I glance
                        back at Vi·ªát, who‚Äôd already gone back to the kitchen. He notices no one had thought to restock
                        the
                        fridge with beverages yet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat was probably Tr·∫ßn‚Äôs fault,‚Äù I say, still distracted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">That alley‚Äôs one-way. Where could she possibly go? And why
                            was
                            she running?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Vi·ªát sco s, the sound distant, before reemerging with a carton of
                        Arrowhead and kicking along another one half full of different sodas. He crouches down to start
                        filling
                        up the fridge‚Äôs compartments. My attention alternates between him and the alley. ‚ÄúYou gonna make
                        me
                        do all the work here?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Linh‚Äôs been out there for a while now. Three minutes?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôve never worked so fast. We recycle the leftover boxes, turn o the lights,
                        then
                        go outside to lock up. As Vi·ªát pulls down the doors over the storefront, I turn toward the
                        alley,
                        imagining Linh there, no one knowing where she‚Äôd gone. What made her run away?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">An unnamable feeling washes over me&mdash;similar to when I was looking at
                        Ali‚Äôs
                        article, knowing, <i class="calibre5">just knowing</i>, there was a piece that did not t. I‚Äôd
                        tried
                        to pass it over without xing it, until Ali confronted me, forcing it out of me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This time, though, maybe I can x what‚Äôs wrong‚Ä¶ whatever that is.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Right on the dot, I get the ten o‚Äôclock text from Ba&mdash;but really from
                        M·∫π&mdash; asking if I was finally on my way home. My thumbs hover over the keypad, my vertical
                        bar
                        blinking slowly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTake the long route home,‚Äù I tell Vi·ªát.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, why?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm going to need to buy some more time, and I don‚Äôt want my mom
                        wondering
                        why I‚Äôm late getting home.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy are you going to be late?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really say.‚Äù Because even I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-46" class="calibre12">Vi·ªát regards me in silence and I imagine that he gets the
                        intensity of his stare from his mother. He‚Äôs not going to do it. He‚Äôs going to ask why and what
                        I‚Äôm
                        doing, and Linh‚Äôs never going to get out of that alley.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTell her you stopped by my house to get a copy of a homework assignment. I‚Äôll
                        cover for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I blink. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He shrugs. I‚Äôve never been more thankful for his laissez-faire
                        attitude.
                        ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre gonna have to tell me later what‚Äôs up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">With a small wave, he‚Äôs o . I quickly type out my excuse to Ba, who answers
                        with a
                        simple ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù And I know it‚Äôs really Ba, because his answers are always short and right to the
                        point.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Just before I hit the opposite street, I think about turning around again. <i
                            class="calibre5">What am I doing? Maybe this is a bad idea to come over here.</i> It feels
                        like
                        I‚Äôve just walked past enemy lines and might step on a mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But now a few feet away from the alley, I hear her whispering, ‚ÄúKeep it
                        together,
                        Linh! It‚Äôs not the end of the world.‚Äù She‚Äôs crouching, breathing deeply, forehead to her knees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I clear my throat when I‚Äôm in front of her. ‚ÄúUm, hey. Are you okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUm, yeah.‚Äù She sounds like she‚Äôs about to cry. I shu e my feet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to bother you. I‚Äôm B·∫£o, from across the street. I don‚Äôt know if
                        you
                        remember me, but we met that one time&mdash;‚Äù I stop. It was ages ago; she wouldn‚Äôt remember. I
                        was
                        just a blip in her childhood.‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI remember you,‚Äù she says slowly, blinking a few times. The question of why
                        I‚Äôm
                        here sits heavy between us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù I ask, my voice catching slightly. Why do I sound like that guy
                        in
                        about every romantic comedy? Next thing I‚Äôm going to ask is <i class="calibre5">Wanna talk about
                            it</i>? ‚ÄúI mean, it seems like things are busy over here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh sighs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just hectic in there. My dad hurt his back, so we‚Äôre short
                        one
                        person. I couldn‚Äôt breathe for a moment, and totally just ran out on the customers.‚Äù She adds,
                        almost to herself, ‚ÄúI feel so useless right now.‚Äù She sounds miserable. I don‚Äôt have to know her
                        to
                        know that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I crouch down to her level. Linh inches away instinctively, but she doesn‚Äôt
                        leave.
                        I try to nd the right words to help her, to make her feel better, but who am I to do that? I‚Äôm
                        mostly a stranger to her. Before I can get a word out, Linh inhales deeply.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-47" class="calibre12">‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù She furiously wipes away her tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll
                        have
                        to go back inside.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Back when we were kids at the temple, I could have gone to any other table, sat
                        with any other kid. Instead, I ended up with her. I wonder if it wasn‚Äôt just the crafts that
                        drew me
                        in, and if it was also her, Linh Mai, in the zone, in her natural habitat. So sure of herself,
                        while
                        other kids were only fooling around and passing time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This isn‚Äôt the Linh I remember.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look at the alleyway door, imagining that it would lead us into a kitchen. I
                        assume her mother is in the kitchen, cooking, delegating tasks to the other cooks &mdash;just
                        like
                        mine would. That‚Äôs her domain and unless an issue manifests, she usually stays there during
                        serving
                        time. Linh‚Äôs mom wouldn‚Äôt have a reason to go up front. A plan starts to form in my head. An
                        impossible one that I hesitate to even voice. ‚ÄúI can help?‚Äù I clear my throat. ‚ÄúI mean, I can
                        help
                        you. You know, with customers and stu . Just for tonight.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut your restaurant&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúClosed a few minutes ago.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if my mom&mdash;‚Äù She pauses, though I know what she‚Äôs
                        suggesting. ‚ÄúI
                        just don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a win-win. I won‚Äôt need to be trained,‚Äù I try to joke.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She cracks a smile, but it disappears. ‚ÄúIf my mom or my dad were hearing this,
                        they‚Äôd think you‚Äôre just trying to spy on us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That type of thinking echoes what my mom would say. It‚Äôs the same kind of
                        gossip
                        that‚Äôs passed around by my mom, the General, and her Vietnamese watch group. The truth of it
                        pierces
                        the bubble enveloping us; the noise from inside the restaurant intrudes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm instigating some sort of plan that Linh clearly doesn‚Äôt want to take part
                        in. I
                        shouldn‚Äôt have even come. Annoyance runs through me&mdash;at Linh for bringing up this confusing
                        feud when I was only trying to help; at me for thoughtlessly running into this whole situation
                        that
                        had nothing to do with me &mdash;for reasons I‚Äôm not capable of understanding right now. I
                        should
                        just go back, return to our separate stories as background characters in each other‚Äôs small
                        worlds.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-48" class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to spy. And I‚Äôm not my mom <i
                            class="calibre5">or</i> my dad. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ B·∫£o.‚Äù I back away, shoving my hands in my pockets.
                        ‚ÄúYou know what, it‚Äôs okay. Sorry for bothering you and for butting in. Good luck.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Tomorrow, when Vi·ªát asks where I‚Äôd gone, I‚Äôll make up a shitty excuse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Tomorrow, everything will be back to normal, this encounter between us erased
                        from
                        our minds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB·∫£o, wait.‚Äù I pivot at my name. ‚ÄúAre you really serious? About helping me?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The despondence already clouding my mind eases just slightly. She still sounds
                        distrustful, but there‚Äôs a note in her voice pulling me back. I retrace my steps, standing in
                        front
                        of her just like before, and I o er my hand&mdash;my sweaty hand. ‚ÄúTonight I‚Äôm B·∫£o Nguy·ªÖn, some
                        guy
                        just trying to help out on what‚Äôs clearly a stressful night.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She stares at my hand, shaking her head slightly, realizing how ridiculous it
                        is
                        for me to do this in some alley. Still, her hand, showing traces of washed-out paint, accepts
                        mine&mdash;and releases.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh wipes her hand on her jeans.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Great.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù she asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI can serve in the dining area. Your mom‚Äôs probably cooking in the back,
                        right?
                        She won‚Äôt even see me. And the waiters&mdash;‚Äù I stop. <i class="calibre5">Shit. I haven‚Äôt
                            thought
                            of that.</i> At our restaurant, B√¨nh and the others have suffered hours of my mom‚Äôs
                        rants&mdash;about them, about customers, and especially about the Mais. They‚Äôve been
                        indoctrinated.
                        So it‚Äôs likely that Linh‚Äôs fellow servers have gone through the same thing. They <i
                            class="calibre5">could</i> recognize me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe have new waiters,‚Äù she adds quietly. ‚ÄúWhich might work in our favor.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She looks away for a second. Then she pulls back her hair. I‚Äôm shocked by how
                        long
                        it is as she hurriedly ties it all up, not caring that some strands have escaped. As the
                        moonlight
                        hits her, as I see the tightness of her jaw set in determination, the erceness in her eyes that
                        makes me breathless for a second, I realize&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The Linh from the temple is here.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre12">She draws back her shoulders, looking like she‚Äôs ready for
                        battle. Which I guess is accurate. ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs do this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre doing it. We‚Äôre really doing this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Please work out</i>, I think, as I follow Linh inside.
                    <p class="calibre1">The smell of ph·ªü is ubiquitous. If I close my eyes, I‚Äôm back inside my family‚Äôs
                        restaurant. We‚Äôre in a narrow hallway where employees store their bags and jackets. To the right
                        is
                        the kitchen, bustling with the clang of pots and pans, water running, shouts from the line
                        cooks.
                        Linh gestures for me to crouch as we get to the serving window. A woman‚Äôs voice calls her name.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Without warning, Linh shoves me back and I backpedal into the alley.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù I mutter as I regain my footing. Is everyone stronger than me? I need
                        to
                        work out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">D·∫°</i>, M·∫π! I‚Äôm good. Sorry, things were just‚Ä¶‚Äù The door
                        cuts
                        me o .</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A pause. For one frightening moment, I imagine her mom emerging from the
                        kitchen,
                        kicking the door open&mdash;as my mom would do&mdash;and seeing me, recognizing me on sight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Brandishing a pair of chopsticks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I know what Vietnamese mothers are capable of doing with chopsticks. And my
                        butt
                        cheeks definitely remember ‚Äô10 when I drank ginger ale for dessert without asking M·∫π and Ba rst.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A few seconds later, Linh pulls me back in by the hand. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she whispers.
                        I
                        nod numbly, my mind suddenly still, feeling her hand in mine again. She looks down, then
                        snatches
                        her hand away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Trying to push past the awkwardness, I say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready. Just tell me what needs
                        to
                        be done.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFollow me. Act normal.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I crouch-walk past the window again. The moment I walk into the dining room, I
                        regret every step that I‚Äôd taken to get here. Though the front-of-house sta might not recognize
                        me
                        as the enemy‚Äôs son, they‚Äôre going to notice a new guy miraculously starting on the job when they
                        needed the help the most.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-50" class="calibre12">But I‚Äôm wrong. They‚Äôre busy with their tables; one guy
                        shoots
                        past us, muttering that he‚Äôd forgotten the drinks. Linh brings me to the reservation system to
                        teach
                        me the layout. We use the same system, I realize, and my mind zones in, keyed to the language
                        we‚Äôve
                        grown up with just a street apart from each other. It‚Äôs not as hard as I thought it would be,
                        the
                        restaurant practically being a mirror of ours.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Unbidden, Linh‚Äôs earlier insinuation and my mom‚Äôs accusing voice come through:
                        <i class="calibre5">They spied on us to learn our ways!</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shake away that thought. Not helping. Unlike our restaurant, though, whose
                        walls
                        and floors have seen better days, this one has a grand statement wall with mirrors and art that
                        might
                        have been done by Linh. I feel a icker of jealousy before Linh pulls me back to reality.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôll stick around in the back of the room to keep an eye on the food coming
                        out.
                        Just look for me&mdash;if you don‚Äôt see me, I‚Äôm at the window and will probably need to get
                        dishes
                        out. But if you hear the bell and I‚Äôm not there to grab whatever‚Äôs ready, just come nd me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I freeze, not turning for a second. A girl our age steps in front of the stand.
                        She‚Äôs wringing her hands, eyes beseeching Linh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about earlier. I should have
                        remembered to check the reservation, but now everything‚Äôs ne, I think.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ne. Mistakes happen, but thanks for xing it, Lisa,‚Äù Linh answers quickly,
                        already grabbing my arm, but the movement catches Lisa‚Äôs eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWait&mdash;have you been working this whole time?‚Äù Lisa asks, more curious
                        than
                        suspicious.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, I was‚Ä¶ prepping in the back.‚Äù I glance at Linh, who gives me the barest
                        of
                        nods. ‚ÄúBut her mom noticed things were getting hectic, so I‚Äôm just jumping in.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, thank God.‚Äù The girl smiles like I just saved her life.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A customer steps up to ask for a table, allowing me and Linh to escape.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNice!‚Äù she whispers. I hold back a smile as she points me to table four by the
                        statement wall, a couple looking to order dessert.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre12">Working at a restaurant over the years, the customers
                        themselves become a pattern, types with issues and demands you learn to manage. I always spot
                        the
                        let‚Äôs-do-something-different-tonight crowd&mdash;the moms who think they‚Äôre being adventurous by
                        deviating from ladies‚Äô night at Olive Garden. They‚Äôre always asking for our opinion: What‚Äôs the
                        crowd favorite? What do <i class="calibre5">you</i> suggest? What‚Äôs the most <i
                            class="calibre5">authentic</i>? Ignorance is the same no matter where you eat. When I do
                        bother
                        to give answers, they don‚Äôt even take my suggestions.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">There are assholes who come in as a party of eight and expect to be seated
                        within
                        ve minutes; Vietnamese women dressed up way too fancy for this type of restaurant, like B√† An
                        who
                        comes on Tuesdays<i class="calibre5">&mdash;‚ÄúB√† ngu,‚Äù</i> my mom spits out whenever she comes
                        in&mdash;and people who didn‚Äôt learn how to use chopsticks at a pliable age, but make a valiant
                        e
                        ort, only to search helplessly for a server so they can ag down forks and spoons.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then, there are customers who don‚Äôt even need to order; they walk right
                        in&mdash;
                        or at least shu e in&mdash;a tide of gray and salt-and-pepper heads, and my parents know
                        immediately
                        what they need. Most of the time, these people and my parents go way back, some even from the
                        refugee days. It‚Äôs all easier for us; they‚Äôre the least fussy of the customers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Tonight, I‚Äôm not spotting any here, maybe because they‚Äôd know to avoid this
                        huge
                        crowd.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">If I have an order in there, Linh slides it down to me to grab. I‚Äôm an hour in
                        and
                        I swing to the back to get my next order. Linh‚Äôs there, elbows on the order table, speaking to
                        someone in the window. She spots me and her eyes widen, which tells me to hide, and I step back

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThird!‚Äù Her mom sounds delighted. She addresses one of the cooks, joking,

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing awesome, M·∫π!‚Äù Linh answers, catching my eye again.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">In my section, I eld questions about the menu, but that‚Äôs no big deal since we
                        sell

                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh shit.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFrank,‚Äù I breathe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Frank‚Äôs ve years older than me. His mom used to work at the nail salon on the
                        same
                        strip as us and we‚Äôd suffered through hours of their lunchtime gossip by playing games on his
                        Nintendo DS, which I‚Äôd never owned. But they‚Äôd moved somewhere else and I hadn‚Äôt seen Frank in
                        years.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre at a standstill, lost for excuses as to why we‚Äôre both in a competitor‚Äôs
                        restaurant. We start speaking over each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm just helping out a friend&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell your mom I&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs no big&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI just wanted some <i class="calibre5">ch·∫£ gi√≤</i>!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We blink at each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My shoulders relax when I see Frank looking sheepish. His group of friends
                        watch
                        the exchange, amused. ‚ÄúLook, I know your mom would have my ass if she knew I was here. Well, rst
                        my
                        mom would. And I‚Äôm not sure what <i class="calibre5">you‚Äôre</i> doing here, but I won‚Äôt tell if
                        you
                        won‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In any other situation, I‚Äôd laugh at the idea that a grown-ass man is still
                        terri
                        ed of getting in trouble with two Vietnamese mothers. But now‚Äôs not the time. ‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThank God. I‚Äôve been craving these egg rolls. They‚Äôre the best in the
                        area&mdash;
                        er, I mean, no offense to your mom.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Good decision.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Apparently Linh was watching us, and as soon as we pass each other, she leans
                        in, a
                        hand on my elbow. ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù This is the third time she‚Äôs touching me, and I‚Äôm finding
                        that I
                        don‚Äôt mind at all. I was lucky and partly thankful that my mom has the skills to intimidate
                        people
                        even if they don‚Äôt live in the area anymore.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Time passes quickly. Customers have finished and left at a steady pace, allowing
                        the
                        line to grow shorter and shorter. The deal has probably given the place a pro t. I remember my
                        mom‚Äôs
                        snide comments about the Mais‚Äô ph·ªü, how it‚Äôs all too bland, but from the smiles on the
                        customers‚Äô
                        faces as they leave, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not the case.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We have ve tickets left at this point. The restaurant closes soon, at midnight,
                        and
                        my time here will end. Maybe we‚Äôll never see each other again after tonight. Maybe this will
                        just be
                        a uke incident. But I don‚Äôt think anyone can deny that we made a good team.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">From across the room, over a sea of heads and laughter, I catch Linh‚Äôs eye.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We got this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I sneak out once the servers have said goodbye to the last customers. Linh
                        gestures
                        that she will follow in a few minutes. I wait by the alley while cleanup happens. The back door
                        opens now and again as some of the bus boys dump the trash or empty boxes. They see me, but just
                        nod
                        indifferently, not caring that some weird guy is just waiting there in near-darkness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh appears at the alley‚Äôs opening having gone through the front. She‚Äôs
                        carrying
                        her messenger bag. ‚ÄúMy mom‚Äôs just cleaning up a few things. You‚Äôre safe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Out by the curb, some feet to the right of the restaurant‚Äôs facade, we
                        wordlessly
                        sit down. I watch her shoulders move as she breathes, until I realize I‚Äôve timed my breathing
                        with
                        hers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She speaks rst. ‚ÄúTonight was‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She trails o , a smile playing on her lips. My brain has gone to mush. More
                        strands
                        have fallen out of her ponytail and I get the urge to move them out of her face, behind her ear.
                        They shine, like the hair of a violin bow just polished.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My hand rises of its own accord. Linh freezes; her body stills, then my brain
                        yells, <i class="calibre5">WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</i> And my hand goes o course and before I
                        realize
                        it‚Ä¶</p>

                        see her smiling. We lose it, our laughs echoing down the street, vibrating with the other

                    <p class="calibre1">Okay, so that pat on the shoulder was weird, but I forget it soon enough.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat was intense!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o laughs, a deep, husky kind of laugh&mdash;God, what a nice sound.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI thought I was finished when your mom called you&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd Lisa came by&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThen that guy Frank who I did <i class="calibre5">not</i> expect to see there

                        all!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre like little kids full of sugar. Or like the kids we were back at temple.
                        This
                        time we didn‚Äôt get caught. ‚ÄúNever thought that would work,‚Äù I say after calming down. The smell
                        of
                        rain is faint in the air. Couples stroll past us, their shoes squeaking. Cars crawl by. ‚ÄúBut we
                        did
                        an awesome job.‚Äù I register the parts of us that are touching&mdash;our thighs and shoulders.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôd shut down his o er before and watched him close up and turn his back on me.
                        Waves of regret overcome me, not only because of what I said about him spying on us, but because
                        I
                        was ashamed that he was only trying to reach out to help and I denied him. He didn‚Äôt have to
                        check
                        on me. He could have gone home just like every other week. But he didn‚Äôt turn <i
                            class="calibre5">his</i> back on <i class="calibre5">me</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I sneak a look at him now. B·∫£o stares the opposite way, resting his forearms on
                        his
                        knees. He‚Äôs, well, <i class="calibre5">hot</i>. He doesn‚Äôt have a bowl cut anymore. There‚Äôs
                        quietness to him as well, reminding me of my mom when she‚Äôs concentrating on a new
                        recipe&mdash;the
                        opposite of the energy around Ba or Ali. I shift, discomforted by these unexpected emotions
                        warring
                        inside me. We don‚Äôt know each other. <i class="calibre5">We can‚Äôt</i>.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt just that.‚Äù I exhale. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this exhibition I wanted to go to. I
                        just
                        found out about it recently, but then remembered it fell on the same day as this whole thing.‚Äù

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I‚Äôm rubbing my thumb against the bump on my middle finger&mdash; made
                        callused after years of resting my pencil against it&mdash;not understanding why I want to
                        explain
                        everything to him in the moment, or if he wants to hear it. ‚ÄúI was going to ask my parents if I
                        could have the night o . But my dad hurt his back, and like I said before, we‚Äôre short-sta ed.‚Äù

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow do you feel now?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôd wanted to run far away. I‚Äôd wanted to be anywhere but in that restaurant.
                        Then
                        B·∫£o reached out to me, looking so solid, so earnest, and just one touch shocked me so much that
                        I
                        had to pull away. It seems silly to think about it now‚Ä¶ but he was real! He was right there, and
                        now
                        right here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay,‚Äù I answer honestly. ‚ÄúNow, at least.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o nods. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good. I mean, tonight was challenging, and you survived it.
                        And
                        there will always be another exhibition.‚Äù He pauses. ‚ÄúWas it some kind of avant-garde
                        exhibition?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAvant-garde?‚Äù I say teasingly. ‚ÄúWow, most people default to cubism. Picasso.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry, who?‚Äù Then he smiles and shrugs one shoulder. I forget what I‚Äôm
                        thinking
                        about for a breath. ‚ÄúI know nothing about art. I just thought ‚Äòavant-garde‚Äô sounded smart.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou <i class="calibre5">almost</i> convinced me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We smile at each other, not knowing what to say next, which I guess is

                        not wait another six years, though.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And he‚Äôs gone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The door rings as it opens. M·∫π is behind me, locking the doors.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSomeone was just asking for directions.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π smiles. She looks younger than I‚Äôve ever seen her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Any other day, she would have pestered me about who I was talking to, but she‚Äôs
                        too
                        elated. She lifts a bulging plastic bag. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bringing home <i class="calibre5">ch√® Th√°i</i>.
                        Three
                        for all of us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNice.‚Äù I stand up and snuggle under her arm when she gestures for me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She presses her nose against my cheek and squeezes me tight, like she used to
                        when
                        I was younger. She‚Äôd say she ‚Äújust wanted to eat me up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Today went well. I want to paint us just like this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúC‚Äômon,‚Äù my mom says. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if Ba is still alive at home.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Ba forgets about his back pain the moment we unlock the door. The television
                        shuts o
                        . My mom dangles the bag of desserts before him like she‚Äôs a baiting dog and he shoots her a
                        mock
                        expression of anger before taking it and undoing the knot. This isn‚Äôt the rst time we‚Äôve had
                        dessert
                        at midnight. When me and Evie were younger&mdash;and probably still too young to stay home by
                        ourselves&mdash;we would fall asleep on the couch, curled up against one another, waiting for
                        them
                        to finish at the restaurant. They‚Äôd bring us leftovers&mdash;always something sweet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre missing one person now, but we still move in unison toward the kitchen.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDid it work?‚Äù Ba asks almost warily. Playing with his hesitation even more, my
                        mom
                        ignores him. She digs into the drawer for spoons, closing it with her right hip, grabs ice from
                        the
                        freezer, and crushes it in a ziplock bag with a pestle. She pours the ice into three cups, then
                        spoons the <i class="calibre5">ch√®</i> over it: coconut milk, sweet, plump longan pieces, cubes
                        of
                        grass jelly that snap under your teeth, red-dyed tapioca pearls made from water chestnuts. It‚Äôs
                        one
                        of my favorite summer desserts&mdash;and one of the best late-night desserts to have without
                        feeling
                        so guilty.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-60" class="calibre12">She‚Äôs taking too long for Ba. ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">B√†

                        tonight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Finally, M·∫π gives in. ‚ÄúIt was perfect.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba accepts the spoon handed to him. Then he just nods. He tries to hide it, but
                        I
                        can tell by the way he‚Äôs straightened his posture that he‚Äôs glad to hear it. ‚ÄúOf course it
                        worked.
                        It‚Äôs all because of me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom smacks him on the shoulder. ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">√îng qu·ª∑</i>, this
                        wouldn‚Äôt
                        be possible if the food wasn‚Äôt good, and that‚Äôs because of me.‚Äù She sends me a shining look.
                        ‚ÄúNot to
                        mention Linh, who took care of the front and the customers.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course. This is Linh we‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I smile weakly. If they were able to read my thoughts, review all the events
                        from

                        tonight. How I wanted to give up. And of course I can‚Äôt do that, shouldn‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôll ruin

                        about everything.</p>

                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúInfestation.‚Äù The word is usually negative, referring to bugs or something else
                        that causes illnesses, but it accurately describes how thoughts of Linh swarm my mind lately.
                        Yesterday after school, as I was wiping down tables, my thoughts drifted to Linh and last week‚Äôs
                        encounter. Then, noticing I wasn‚Äôt doing any work, M·∫π whacked me good on the head, propelling
                        the
                        image of Linh&mdash;hair tied up like that night and that damned smile&mdash;from me. Vi·ªát
                        laughed,
                        watching me recover. He knew what was distracting me because I‚Äôd already given him a recap in
                        our
                        forensic science class together, waiting for our teacher to get here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh Mai.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou talked to Linh Mai.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, you can stop saying her name like that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just hard to believe. You actually helped the enemy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo <i class="calibre5">you</i> see her as an enemy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, but that‚Äôs what I know your mom would want me to say.‚Äù A slow smirk began
                        to
                        form on his face. ‚ÄúThe question is: Do <i class="calibre5">you</i> see Linh as the enemy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI never did,‚Äù I answered quickly, almost marveling at the truth of it. Vi·ªát
                        arched
                        an eyebrow, which I‚Äôd never seen him do.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe you actually talked to her. I never thought that‚Äôd
                        happen. I
                        mean, way to go!‚Äù I was somewhat amazed and bolstered by his enthusiastic reaction‚Ä¶ like he was
                        cheering me on.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-62" class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre strangely happy about this. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm dead if
                        my
                        mom ever</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">nds out about this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre taking a risk. Going out of your comfort zone.
                        And
                        you don‚Äôt usually do that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">All of this was true, but it was something I‚Äôd never heard coming from my best
                        friend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now, I‚Äôm debating the possibility that my school schedule is conspiring to keep
                        me
                        and Linh separated. When I do ‚Äúsee‚Äù her, it‚Äôs just the usual ash of her hair as she turns the
                        corner. I can never seem to nd her during passing time or lunchtime.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A nagging thought comes to mind: What if Linh‚Äôs actually dodging me? Did
                        something
                        happen after I left her? Maybe her mother <i class="calibre5">did</i> see us and told her o .
                        Maybe
                        Linh agreed not to speak to me because of that. It‚Äôs not hard to imagine what she‚Äôs heard about
                        me
                        and my family over the years.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A few minutes before sixth period&mdash;journalism class&mdash;I reach into my
                        locker to exchange books. Allison basically said she was ‚Äúa bit‚Äù disappointed by the quality of
                        our
                        recent articles, so there‚Äôs going to be a long lesson on how to write. Is Rowan ever going to
                        step
                        up and remind Allison that she‚Äôs still a student? I mentally and emotionally prepare myself,
                        when I
                        sense someone next to me. I close my locker.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My day hasn‚Äôt completely gone to shit. ‚ÄúLinh. Hey.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh leans her shoulder against the lockers. ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù She hands me a carton of
                        chocolate milk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her hair‚Äôs down past her shoulders, longer than I remember, and she looks like
                        the
                        Linh post-Ph·ªü Day instead of the one I‚Äôd checked in on in that alley. My throat feels dry.
                        ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs
                        this for?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get to it at lunch but didn‚Äôt want to throw it away. Consider it a
                        small
                        token for helping me out last week.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou really know the way to a guy‚Äôs heart.‚Äù <i class="calibre5">Okay, B·∫£o,
                            okay!
                            That was smooth‚Ä¶ maybe?</i> We start walking. I try to remember if I‚Äôm actually going the
                        right
                        way. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù That‚Äôs the question I ask after a WEEK of thinking about her?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-63" class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs almost over. I feel like it‚Äôs been
                        one
                        assignment after another.‚Äù Linh then grimaces. ‚ÄúAPs especially.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow many do you have?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThree.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My stomach clenches. Three? And she‚Äôs still alive?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúPlus I have to work tonight.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI do too. Maybe we‚Äôll see each other?‚Äù I say this as casually as possible, not
                        wanting to seem like I‚Äôm suggesting anything other than, well, just seeing each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSure, maybe I can help out this time,‚Äù she says conspiratorially, adding a
                        smile.
                        I‚Äôm feeling the effects of it&mdash;maybe it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs so much clearer under the
                        lights&mdash;a
                        nice faintness that I‚Äôve only felt after waking from a long, good nap.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no chance we can get away with that again,‚Äù I say weakly, half as a
                        joke,
                        until it registers that isn‚Äôt a joke. It‚Äôs the truth. Things just worked out over at Linh‚Äôs, but
                        he
                        can‚Äôt ever expect that to repeat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Some of the laughter leaves Linh‚Äôs eyes, and we walk in quiet silence, our
                        bodies
                        remembering to feel unaccustomed to each other‚Äôs company. That feeling, back when I thought
                        she‚Äôd
                        rejected my help, takes over again, until she says, so quietly that I might have imagined it:
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sad to think about‚Ä¶ because we worked great together. Like we were
                        meant to
                        be partners.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Partners.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Yeah, it sounds right to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Eager to just keep talking until we can‚Äôt anymore, I ask more about her
                        classes.
                        She asks if Allison is <i class="calibre5">still</i> attending our classes instead of using her
                        study hall time to go home. She seems to talk about Allison with a teasing smile, so I don‚Äôt
                        tell
                        her that I‚Äôm truly terri ed of her in certain moments.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We make it to journalism class, where&mdash;no surprise&mdash;Allison sits in
                        Rowan‚Äôs seat, next to her the biggest Blue Bottle cup of iced co ee I‚Äôve ever seen. In a
                        disorienting move, she smiles at Linh. She looks different when she does that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey, lady!‚Äù Her eyes fall to me, then icker over to Linh. If possible, her
                        lips
                        widen. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see you two together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre12">Linh clears her throat. ‚ÄúAli, I told you about how he

                        rising
                        like a villain who finally settled on a plan for world domination.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù Linh says, earning a glance that is both withering and playful from
                        Ali.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo, in one of my classes, some girls were complaining that their boyfriends
                        are
                        taking them to all the wrong places. Boring vibe. Expensive, etcetera, etcetera. So what if we
                        created a whole new beat for the newspaper? Assign a reporter to visit new places that any high
                        school student can go to <i class="calibre5">and</i> actually a ord, and tell the real deal
                        about
                        it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWill restaurants let us do that?‚Äù We‚Äôre not exactly the <i
                            class="calibre5">Los
                            Angeles Times</i>. Who cares about what someone from La Quinta says about their
                        establishment?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I can spin something,‚Äù she tells me confidently. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically free
                        publicity for the restaurants.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, yeah, it‚Äôs not a bad idea,‚Äù Linh says. ‚ÄúDo you have someone in mind?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood question.‚Äù She points both fingers at me. ‚ÄúB·∫£o, I‚Äôd want you on this
                        beat.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In what way does any of this sound good or helpful to the newspaper? Me who‚Äôs
                        been
                        delegated to proofreading duties. Me who consistently gets Bs on his English Lit essays.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre better than you think you are, as much as it pains me to say.‚Äù
                        Ali
                        watches me closely; there‚Äôs a gleam in her eyes telling me she likes that she can
                        shock&mdash;and
                        disturb&mdash;me with her compliments. ‚ÄúAnd Linh, you can help, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her eyes shift to me. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHear me out: B·∫£o puts words to the scene, rates the food, describes it. Since
                        he
                        grew up in restaurants like you and knows food, he should <i class="calibre5">hypothetically</i>
                        be
                        capable of doing this&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I interject.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre12">‚Äú&mdash;and you can sketch the environment. Or paint it.
                        I‚Äôve
                        watched you sketch for years, Linh. You‚Äôd be perfect for this. The newspaper desperately needs
                        your
                        talent. It needs something entirely new.‚Äù Her voice has taken on a tone I‚Äôve never heard from
                        Ali
                        before&mdash;something more earnest. She‚Äôs turning a bit softer, gifting me a glimpse of her
                        normal
                        self, and of their friendship.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh looks away, deep in thought. She said she was taking three APs just
                        earlier,
                        not to mention juggling after-school work at the restaurant. I‚Äôm brought back to last week,
                        seeing
                        her in that alley alone, looking overwhelmed, looking lost. Something inside had pulled me
                        toward
                        her then. I just knew I needed to see if she was all right.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That feeling rises again, and the words are out before I can stop them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll
                        do
                        it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The girls look at me&mdash;Ali, triumphantly and maybe even a little
                        approvingly;
                        Linh just confused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I know there‚Äôs a lot against me. It‚Äôll take away some of my weekends, most
                        likely.
                        But as long as my parents don‚Äôt nd out <i class="calibre5">who</i> I‚Äôm working with, this
                        project
                        might work. ‚ÄúAnd for what it‚Äôs worth, Linh, I know you‚Äôd be awesome for this, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can do this. It‚Äôs not just the workload&mdash;it‚Äôs the fact
                        that
                        I haven‚Äôt done something like this, let alone had my work published in a newspaper. What if I
                        just
                        <i class="calibre5">think</i> I‚Äôm good and it turns out I‚Äôm not?‚Äù Her question comes out
                        quietly,
                        laced with uncertainty.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, no,‚Äù Ali counters immediately. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone could think that.
                        I‚Äôve
                        seen what you‚Äôve done ever since we were twelve.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd the flyers. They‚Äôre great!‚Äù I interject. ‚ÄúIf anything, it‚Äôs another chance
                        to
                        show just how good you are.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh,‚Äù Ali says. ‚ÄúYou have two people here saying you can do this!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow&mdash;‚Äù She pauses. She‚Äôs aiming that half-said question at me. I read her
                        mind like that night. We‚Äôre part of a long history; we might not be directly involved like our
                        parents, but nothing can change the fact that our families and our restaurants are considered
                        rivals.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So I keep my answer simple. ‚ÄúWe can make it work.‚Äù We have <i
                            class="calibre5">worked</i> together and it turned out great. Because it wasn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs
                        family
                        against someone. It was just me and Linh then. I want to believe that can happen again.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre12">After a few beats, Linh looks away. ‚ÄúLet me think about it
                        some more.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a no, so yay!‚Äù Ali claps her hands together and hugs her, then
                        turns to
                        do the same to me before remembering herself. Linh still appears unsure, maybe a bit exhausted
                        in
                        her thoughts, but she still musters a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When we‚Äôre alone, Linh says, ‚ÄúAli only asks for help when she absolutely needs
                        it.
                        So you‚Äôve earned some Ali points.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, because I was in the negative for a while.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh heads o to her art class. When the last of my classmates walks in, Ali
                        closes
                        the door, game face on. The lights dim abruptly, freaking some kids out, but it‚Äôs only Rowan
                        being
                        complicit in whatever torture Allison has cooked up for today. Turns out I don‚Äôt really care
                        about
                        that. Linh and I might get to be partners.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I open the chocolate milk carton and sip from it. <i

                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Of course, when I was walking with B·∫£o, I didn‚Äôt mean to give the chocolate milk
                        to
                        him. I didn‚Äôt finish it at lunch, felt guilty throwing it away&mdash;my parents‚Äô voices
                        reprimanding
                        me&mdash;so I carried it for my next class. Then I saw B·∫£o at his locker, and before I even knew
                        it,
                        my legs were carrying me across the hallway and suddenly: chocolate milk. If Ali saw that, she
                        would‚Äôve never let me live it down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I dip my brush into a jar of water, washing it of cadmium yellow. Yamamoto‚Äôs
                        voice
                        is on background as she talks to the class, weaving in between each student to check on their
                        work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o has snuck his way into my brain for the last few days. I turn into a mess
                        every
                        time I see him, which is more than I can ever remember. There‚Äôs a theory that we‚Äôve talked about
                        in
                        my psychology class called red car syndrome, where you hear or see something once, like a red
                        car,
                        and suddenly you see red cars everywhere. I don‚Äôt remember seeing B·∫£o so many times in the
                        hallway&mdash;or maybe I‚Äôve trained myself to see past him&mdash;but I‚Äôve turned a corner
                        several
                        times before pivoting in the opposite direction. Just the other day at work, while my dad was
                        passing along details on where to meet Quy·ªÅn Th√†nh, which happens to be today, I was sneaking
                        looks
                        at the window, hoping to catch sight of B·∫£o through his. My mom wondered aloud if I should dress
                        up
                        for the interview.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Could we really work together?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Had Ali planned to pair us the moment the idea came to mind, or was it after I
                        told
                        her about B·∫£o and Ph·ªü Day? I make a note to bring it up later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúLinhhhh.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre12">But the question is: <i class="calibre5">How are we ever
                            going
                            to do this?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Yamamoto is right by my ear. I yelp and my brush falls out of my hand and
                        clatters
                        on the oor. Classmates, now busy packing up, snicker. Yamamoto stands before me, arms akimbo,
                        but
                        while other teachers would be pissed o , she only appears amused, a stampede of questions
                        probably
                        in her mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôve seen you get lost inside your brain before, but never like
                        this. I
                        mean, you were <i class="calibre5">far</i> gone,‚Äù she says teasingly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Blushing, I hurriedly fold up my tarp and place my canvas on a tabletop by
                        other
                        day-old canvases. Just a bunch of fruits in baskets and flowers&mdash;beginning paint classes. I
                        wash
                        my brushes with an odorless thinner&mdash;I hate the citrus kind &mdash;before wiping them dry,
                        then
                        running them under water with some linseed soap. The usual next step is futile. I wash my hands
                        until most of the paint has disappeared. I‚Äôve stopped worrying about the rest on my fingers; it
                        all
                        eventually just fades. The bell rings and I push my way out into the hallway.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Inside my jeans pocket, my phone buzzes. I have a half hour until I have to
                        meet
                        with Quy·ªÅn Th√†nh, learn about the <i class="calibre5">fascinating</i> world of engineering.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey, lady,‚Äù my best friend says casually at my locker. But I know her better
                        and
                        read the gleam in her eyes. She wants to talk about B·∫£o. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd ever been more
                        excited
                        than after hearing me tell her about Ph·ªü Day. ‚ÄúWow, I didn‚Äôt know he had it in him,‚Äù Ali had
                        said in
                        mock surprise.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow was art class?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I roll my eyes at her. ‚ÄúIs that the question you really want to ask?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm a journalist. I have to throw out questions to warm you up. But

                    <p class="calibre4">rst question. I‚Äôll just nd restaurants that are a little farther outside the

                    <p class="calibre1">of where your parents tend to go. Aren‚Äôt you always telling me that your parents
                        or
                        people they know never eat out because your mom&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú&mdash;says she can make anything at home.‚Äù Evie and I used to beg our parents
                        to
                        take us to McDonalds for Happy Meals.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù She signs the number two. ‚ÄúSecond, I‚Äôm well aware of this feud. I
                        don‚Äôt
                        get it, but I‚Äôm not supposed to. But it‚Äôs your families who despise each other. What about you?
                        For
                        once, let‚Äôs just remove the whole family situation&mdash; if it‚Äôs just you and B·∫£o standing
                        across
                        from each other, would you say that you like him?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôd be very easy to like him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She smiles knowingly. After a few seconds of delay, my words catch up to me. My
                        face warms up. ‚ÄúSeems like you already do like him.‚Äù She pauses dramatically. ‚ÄúMaybe even more
                        than
                        that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I close my mouth, reaching out to shut my locker door that dangled between us.
                        The
                        afternoon rush around us seems more muted than it usually is, the crowd owing naturally around
                        us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Like him</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My phone buzzes again. Fifteen minutes until the meeting.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt have time for this right now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali nods in agreement, like she‚Äôs just read my mind. ‚ÄúThings like this don‚Äôt
                        really
                        wait for you to catch up. Like the way you end up drawing something you never intended to draw.
                        Just
                        think about it: When you <i class="calibre5">like</i> an art piece, how much of it is thinking
                        and
                        how much of it is feeling?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">There are artists and fans interested in artwork on an intellectual level; they
                        consider the message of the piece, the intention of the artist, the connotations of the time and
                        place of its creation. Yamamoto‚Äôs one of those artists, which makes all of her lessons
                        interesting.
                        But I‚Äôm different from that&mdash;in art that I like, in the pieces I create. It‚Äôs always a
                        memory or
                        feeling that I start with. Ali knows this by now.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre using way too many art metaphors today.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow else will I actually get through to you?‚Äù Ali nudges me by the shoulder
                        and we
                        walk outside together, heading to her car. She‚Äôd told me she would drop me o at a nearby
                        Starbucks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A jock runs by, jostling me as he tries catching up with his teammates o to
                        practice. The buses full of students depart one by one, leaving little trails of smog.
                        Everything‚Äôs
                        moving, but, somehow, inside me is still.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just feel things out?‚Äù she asks me nally as she unlocks her
                        Nissan,
                        and we slide into our seats. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much in your life that you can‚Äôt control, Linh, as much
                        as
                        I <i class="calibre5">totally</i> want things to be different for you. So maybe you can use this
                        chance to do something for yourself. Forget everyone&mdash;your family, B·∫£o&mdash;this is about
                        you.
                        No rules but your own.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I buckle my seat belt. A reminder pops up on my phone: ten minutes until my co
                        ee
                        with Quy·ªÅn. Without words I show it to Ali, who brushes the notice away, saying there‚Äôs no
                        reason to
                        worry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI thought you didn‚Äôt like B·∫£o,‚Äù I finally say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI said that I didn‚Äôt <i class="calibre5">know</i> if I liked him or disliked
                        him.
                        But he has an eye for words. I think he‚Äôs better than he realizes.‚Äù She makes a right but too
                        widely, and she needs to adjust before straightening in the lane. ‚ÄúYou know, I feel like I can
                        write
                        a whole human-interest piece about you, B·∫£o, and your families.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI strongly disapprove.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCan you imagine the headline?‚Äù To my horror, she releases her hands from the
                        steering wheel, doing what I‚Äôll now call the Banner Move. ‚ÄúTwo students from rival families and
                        restaurants? Like <i class="calibre5">Romeo and Juliet</i>&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A car honks at us and her hands snap back onto the wheel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJust drive.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">As I walk into the restaurant after an exhausting half hour with Quy·ªÅn Th√†nh, I
                        try
                        to gather enough enthusiasm to convince my parents they didn‚Äôt waste a favor on me. Even though
                        they
                        did.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-71" class="calibre12">Quy·ªÅn Th√†nh had shown up before me. She sat
                        straight-backed,
                        on a stool no less, her badge from the rm proudly pinned to her chest. She was on her laptop
                        looking
                        focused as she sent o e-mail after e-mail. She wore a gray business suit&mdash;which I won‚Äôt
                        mention
                        to my mom because then she‚Äôll despair, ‚ÄúI knew it! You should have worn one to make an
                        impression.‚Äù
                        While Quy·ªÅn was petite and smaller than me, the strength of her handshake took me by surprise.
                        Her
                        eyes, framed by black thick-rimmed glasses, were strikingly clear and I felt that she was
                        somehow
                        scanning my body for answers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I had questions that I looked up the night before, pulled o some college
                        website
                        about informational interviews. She had clear, precise, straightforward answers; I had to wonder
                        if
                        she was used to doing this type of favor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She was a mechanical engineer but she was ‚Äútold that I liked art,‚Äù and knew
                        tons of
                        friends who were ‚Äúinto that thing, but it‚Äôs not really My Thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Our meeting was interspersed with inconvenient pauses, long sips of cold co ee,
                        and
                        me finding it hard to maintain eye contact because I was afraid she‚Äôd see the truth about how
                        little
                        interest I really had in engineering.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">By the end of it, though, she smiled sympathetically. She even hugged me as I
                        thanked her for her time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know I bored you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, I&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sort of easy to read.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hate my face. But Quy·ªÅn Th√†nh just laughed. ‚ÄúTrust me: You‚Äôre not the only
                        one
                        who‚Äôs had to su er through hearing about my work. As much as I love what I do, I know it‚Äôs not
                        for
                        some people.‚Äù She was being so nice that I wish I could have pretended to feel something. But as
                        Ali
                        mentioned, that‚Äôs not the way I work&mdash;I either have to feel something‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Or I don‚Äôt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSome advice. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd enjoy this career as much as I do if it wasn‚Äôt
                        <i class="calibre5">mine.</i> And what I mean by that is it‚Äôs something I can claim as my own.
                        If
                        my parents were forcing me to be a physicist, I would not be okay. So, do you have something
                        that‚Äôs
                        <i class="calibre5">yours</i>?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt nod or answer, still hesitant to prove how I‚Äôve
                        wasted
                        her time. But maybe she saw something in me because she merely nodded, saying, ‚ÄúGood. Then
                        protect
                        it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We parted and she promised not to say anything to her parents.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Back in the restaurant, my parents don‚Äôt jump on me right away about the co ee
                        interview. Instead, M·∫π is wrangling a box free from tape. Ba is sitting in a corner booth that
                        my
                        mom banished him to. While his back is better, he‚Äôs still wearing his back brace and looks
                        completely miserable, like a dog in his ea cone. I set down my backpack and slip into M·∫π‚Äôs
                        booth,
                        inching closer for a look at what‚Äôs inside the box. It‚Äôs a flower vase, cerulean with specks the
                        color
                        of the jade bracelets she and just about every woman in my family wear. When I was younger, I
                        thought it was something every Vi·ªát woman had to wear, some rite of passage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù It‚Äôs handmade, that‚Äôs for sure. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool. Where‚Äôs it from?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúD√¨ V√†ng.‚Äù M·∫π sighs. My aunt always seems to evoke that kind of sigh from my
                        mom.
                        She hands over the vase; I weigh it, feel the slight bumps alternating with smooth curves. I
                        took a
                        pottery class once in freshman year but couldn‚Äôt control the speed of my spin, or get the clay
                        into
                        the shape that I wanted. But D√¨ V√†ng does this for a living, which is mind-boggling to think
                        about,
                        something I can only dream of.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She likes sending my mom things, and I know M·∫π likes them, as much as she
                        doesn‚Äôt
                        approve of her sister‚Äôs career choice, since she displays them everywhere: the mantel under the
                        TV,
                        the nightstand in my parents‚Äô bedroom. I have an elephant-shaped piggy bank that D√¨ V√†ng made
                        for my
                        fth birthday and hand-delivered when she was last in America.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Since the Vietnam War, and especially after the fall of Saigon, which was what
                        forced our family to scatter, most of my extended family relocated to Washington, Louisiana,
                        Florida, and Texas. It wasn‚Äôt exactly cheap to y over here, and the government has strict rules,
                        so
                        my aunt must have made the right friends to be able to visit for a little while. I imagined how
                        cool
                        it‚Äôd be for her to live permanently nearby and how she could teach me more about her art.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôd asked my mom why D√¨ V√†ng didn‚Äôt want to just move here.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre12">M·∫π just waved her hand. Her usual gesture and non-answer.
                        ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried to convince her, but she says she‚Äôs happy there.‚Äù Then my mom turned her attention
                        to
                        something seemingly more important, ignoring my question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She and Ba tell childhood stories about Vietnam all the time, but they often
                        con
                        ict with each other: the good times, when M·∫π talks about running carefree along the beach with
                        her
                        friends, the sun rising behind them, or when Ba would play soccer with American soldiers
                        stationed
                        nearby. Then there are the dark days&mdash;funerals, saying goodbye to family members, losing
                        everything on their way here. It‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt ever understand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you supposed to be working?‚Äù Ba says grumpily from his booth. M·∫π and I
                        roll
                        our eyes, then pack up the vase again ever so carefully. ‚ÄúAh, your co ee meeting!‚Äù she suddenly
                        remembers. ‚ÄúHow was it? Isn‚Äôt Quy·ªÅn Th√†nh so nice?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe was really nice. Really helpful.‚Äù I pick at the ap of the box the vase
                        came
                        in. I wonder if she can pick up on the dullness in my voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π nods approvingly. ‚ÄúPerfect. It‚Äôs all working out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Just like Ph·ªü Day. Just like anything that doesn‚Äôt make them worry too much.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">As I‚Äôm tying up my hair, readying myself for my shift, Ali‚Äôs words from earlier
                        came back to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">There‚Äôs so much in your life that you can‚Äôt control.‚Ä¶ So

                    <h3>Chapter 13</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I groan the moment I walk into work. My mom and her circle are planted in one of
                        the
                        side booths, cackling about something. The General‚Äôs telling the story, her face pink with
                        laughter.
                        I‚Äôm sure this is <i class="calibre5">after</i> she brags about her son at Stanford and her <i
                            class="calibre5">other</i> son at MIT, both of whom rarely come home.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe meats they use are never fresh! One day I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll poison their
                        customers.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt say things like that,‚Äù one of the women says while laughing, her
                        voice nasal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs true. I swear. I‚Äôm surprised <i class="calibre5">that restaurant</i>
                        is
                        still standing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Of course that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre laughing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Biting back my disgust, I quickly walk to the back, though not before
                        registering
                        my mom‚Äôs laugh, dimmed compared to the General‚Äôs. I wonder&mdash; considering how much she talks
                        shit about the restaurant to me and my dad&mdash; does she really want Linh‚Äôs family gone that
                        much?
                        Does she truly want the other restaurant to fail so badly?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I nod absentmindedly at one of the line cooks, Tr·∫ßn, who goes into a series of
                        coughs as he breaks down cardboard boxes. Eddie‚Äôs prepping vegetables, his knife-chopping at
                        warp-speed. A pile of onions takes over the prep table and newly washed aprons sit nearby for
                        the
                        taking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Before, I would have let these thoughts slide; they were normal things to hear.
                        Not
                        now, though. I remember Linh, her near breakdown in the alley, the pleasure in her mother‚Äôs
                        voice as
                        she heard how customers complimented her cooking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Maybe there‚Äôs good reason for the Mais to hate us.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-75" class="calibre12">‚ÄúGod save us,‚Äù Vi·ªát groans as he enters the kitchen,
                        backpack
                        hanging o one shoulder. ‚ÄúB√† Nhi‚Äôs voice gives me the worst headaches.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I smirk. I call her the General, but Vi·ªát calls her by the term usually
                        reserved
                        for older people. <i class="calibre5">B√† Nhi, b√† qu·ª∑</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAt least she‚Äôs going to leave soon.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow would you know that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát swipes through his phone. ‚ÄúMy mom says she heard from Tracy‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs
                        uncle
                        that B√† Nhi‚Äôs planning to get a nose job. So she has an appointment.‚Äù It takes a minute for me
                        to
                        connect the dots. ‚ÄúThe uncle at Star Nails.‚Äù Still doesn‚Äôt help, but if Vi·ªát‚Äôs mom is the
                        source,
                        I‚Äôll believe her. She‚Äôs judicious about the people around her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Tr·∫ßn, still dealing with the boxes, coughs so hard that spit ies from his
                        mouth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou okay, man?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUgh, I‚Äôve been so sick. But I can‚Äôt miss out on work. Got some bills to pay.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom comes into the kitchen. <i class="calibre5">‚ÄúM√†y b·ªánh h·∫£?‚Äù</i> she asks
                        Tr·∫ßn. She doesn‚Äôt wait for an answer. Despite the usually threatening-sounding <i
                            class="calibre5">‚Äúm√†y,‚Äù</i> she steps closer and rests the back of her hand against his
                        forehead. ‚ÄúWhy are you working? You are burning up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGo home. Sleep.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know but I kind of need the money and&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGo home. You will get the money.‚Äù She pivots on her feet and heads to the
                        stove
                        where broth simmers in two pots. ‚ÄúHere, take some of this home. It‚Äôll be good for your throat.
                        <i class="calibre5">B·ªánh m√† c√≤n ƒëi l√†m</i>.‚Äù She tsks. Then she calls him an idiot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Again he tries to protest, but M·∫π steamrolls over him. She won‚Äôt take no for an
                        answer. Giving up, Tr·∫ßn thanks my mom as he backs out of the kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A few years ago, Tr·∫ßn‚Äôs wife had had their rst daughter, but she couldn‚Äôt take
                        o
                        more work&mdash;her company didn‚Äôt have maternity leave&mdash;so on certain days, M·∫π let them
                        leave
                        the baby in the room with air-conditioning. The other servers and I would rotate shifts, poking
                        our
                        head in. Ba had worn the baby monitor on his belt like it was some fashion accessory. But my mom
                        mostly looked after her, cooed at her in a pitch I‚Äôd never heard from her.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-76" class="calibre12">I watch now as my mom gives Vi·ªát a to-do list for today,
                        her
                        voice sharp and leaving no room for arguments. This is the mom I see all the time. But she‚Äôs
                        also
                        the type of person who‚Äôd give a sick man a container of broth, who‚Äôd babysit a kid at a busy
                        restaurant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom is still a kind person, even though she hangs around the General, and
                        listens to jokes at the Mais‚Äô expense. She has to be.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000069.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs 8:00 p.m. on the dot, and I‚Äôm finishing up to go home to do homework. My
                        mom made
                        a point to let me out early even though the shop closes at ten.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I spot Linh‚Äôs door creeping open. <i class="calibre5">That‚Äôs right. She also
                            leaves
                            at this time.</i> She‚Äôs too busy stu ng something into her messenger bag to notice me at
                        rst. A
                        week ago, I‚Äôd count the seconds until she was gone. Today, though‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Risk. Once I think about it, I‚Äôve never really taken a risk. But I‚Äôm taking a
                        risk
                        today. Seized by an emotion I can‚Äôt place, I‚Äôm out my own door in a split second.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey, Linh!‚Äù I shout.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Alarmed, she looks up, then her expression melts into recognition. She says
                        something, but a beat-up sedan decides to struggle through at the exact moment, dragging away
                        her
                        words. We smile when it‚Äôs gone. I realize my parents also have a clear view of us enemies
                        fraternizing with each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Getting the same idea, Linh gestures to a spot out of window view. She‚Äôs tied
                        back
                        her hair into two small buns, exposing her face so that when she‚Äôs smiling at me, like now, her
                        left
                        dimple shows. My stomach does a dismount. I recover and smile back as best I can.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo, there‚Äôs this boba place that I love,‚Äù Linh says, as if we‚Äôre just
                        continuing a
                        conversation. ‚Äú7 Leaves.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù <i class="calibre5">Hold back, B·∫£o.</i> I clear my throat. ‚ÄúI mean,
                        I‚Äôve
                        gone there all the time.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou wanna meet there? We need to figure out some sort of plan if we‚Äôre going
                        to work
                        together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe are?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôve decided, why not have some fun?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-77" class="calibre12">My heartbeat spikes in excitement. ‚ÄúYes, a plan.‚Äù
                        Apparently I
                        can only say monosyllabic words. ‚ÄúI mean, that sounds great. Copacetic.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I wince. <i class="calibre5">I just said that, didn‚Äôt I?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Luckily Linh laughs. ‚ÄúMeet you there in an hour? Just want to change. I smell
                        like
                        sh sauce.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That gives me an hour to get ready. I probably smell like sh sauce too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I sni myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Yep.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Once Linh disappears around the corner, I bolt in the opposite direction toward
                        home.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000070.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I will be ‚Äústudying with Vi·ªát.‚Äù The normal translation is that we‚Äôd just play
                        games
                        at his house. But now that‚Äôs changed. Vi·ªát texts me that I need to pay him each time I use him
                        as my
                        cover. When I respond with a GIF of Stephen Colbert lifting a certain finger, Vi·ªát merely sends
                        back a
                        kiss emoji. But really, any activity that was Vi·ªát-related was okay in my parents‚Äô book and they
                        barely acknowledged me as I ew out of the house, M·∫π occupied with a Korean drama because she‚Äôs
                        all
                        about the drama. Ba waved me aside, more preoccupied by his bowl of warm, sugary <i

                    <p class="calibre12">Linh is outside 7 Leaves, her hair free around her shoulders, dressed in jeans
                        and
                        a white tee.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I never thought walking to the cashier would cause an internal freak-out, but
                        it
                        did. I order milk tea while Linh orders a strawberry. <i class="calibre5">Do I pay? I should
                            pay,
                            right?</i> The counter person, some twentysomething bored-as-hell guy glances between Linh
                        and
                        me, looking like he pities us. Awkward teenagers, he must be thinking. Then he sighs out loud.
                        Definitely thinking about us. Just to relieve us from his gaze, I pull out my wallet and the
                        cashier
                        nods almost approvingly, like, <i class="calibre5">Good on you, bud.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to do that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúConsider it payment for the chocolate milk the other day.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-78" class="calibre12">We get our drinks and sit down at a table sandwiched
                        between
                        two others: one table with a couple, Chinese from my guess, who act all lovey-dovey with each
                        other,
                        and another table with a grandpa sleeping on a stool&mdash;impressive&mdash; wearing a fishing
                        hat, a
                        black vest over a plaid long-sleeve shirt, and beige cargo shorts. A sherman who doesn‚Äôt sh. The
                        cashier says something, but the grandpa has zero reaction. Probably the owner or the owner‚Äôs
                        father.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The upside of meeting here is that it‚Äôs easy to see who‚Äôs here and who‚Äôs not.
                        Especially if anyone is a part of M·∫π and the General‚Äôs group.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The seat beneath me is chilly. My stomach gets jittery the moment we sit down
                        together. The quiet in the room, the hum of the fridge, accent our proximity. Our ankles touch,
                        and
                        all of my body&mdash;I mean, <i class="calibre5">all</i> of it&mdash;wakes up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs taking out a notebook and pen; she‚Äôs serious about coming up with a
                        plan,
                        and maybe that‚Äôs the only reason she suggested meeting here. To get something o her checklist. I
                        try
                        to tell myself I‚Äôd be okay if all we talked about was the new beat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Only thing is, I‚Äôd be lying.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">I glance over at her, but she has her eyes to the table, her fingers playing
                        with the

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLike spies wearing sunglasses.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Instantly, the image of my mom popping out from behind the serving counter, in
                        sunglasses and some funny hat, nearly makes me choke on my drink. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre safe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh cups her drink. ‚ÄúPart of me chose this place for that reason.‚Äù We smile
                        sympathetically at each other. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre having second thoughts, you don‚Äôt have to do this.
                        Ali
                        can be pushy sometimes, but I can let her know this isn‚Äôt your thing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThis could be my <i class="calibre5">thing</i>,‚Äù I joke. ‚ÄúIt might even be my

                    <p id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre12">Linh catches on. ‚ÄúCareful or Ali might volunteer you for

                    <p class="calibre12">I pretend to shudder. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell her.‚Äù The tension lets up and I want it to
                        stay
                        that way, so I rush through. ‚ÄúLook, I would honestly not be here if I didn‚Äôt want to be. But
                        it‚Äôs
                        sounding like you might be second-guessing all this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This time, she raises her chin, like she‚Äôs accepting a challenge. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not. Not

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve been thinking that it‚Äôs ridiculous we grew up across from each
                        other
                        and never truly met. Because the night we worked together proved that you aren‚Äôt like what I‚Äôve
                        been
                        told. Well, at least what I‚Äôve heard about your family.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">I hesitate to answer. It might cut this meeting short. ‚ÄúYou really want to

                    <p class="calibre12">I try to picture my parents as gang members&mdash;my mom might actually be a
                        believable leader&mdash;but I keep that to myself. ‚ÄúThey also said‚Ä¶ that you drove out B√°c Xu√¢n

                        his place.‚Äù Linh‚Äôs mouth drops open at that. She looks truly o ended, and I wish I could take it
                        back. ‚ÄúI mean, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve <i class="calibre5">heard</i>. I‚Äôm not saying I believe it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe would never! He was a family friend. I was there the moment he told my

                        say
                        that to you?‚Äù My face must have given me away. ‚ÄúHonestly, your mom can be brutal.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I bristle. It‚Äôs never a good feeling to hear someone you know get called out.
                        ‚ÄúYou
                        think she‚Äôs brutal? Haven‚Äôt you met Nhi Tr∆∞ng? She‚Äôs the real leader. <i

                        the worst.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Something we can agree on. A part of me is relieved the attention‚Äôs o my mom;
                        I‚Äôm
                        not sure I want to hear more about what may have been said against us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, we know about her,‚Äù Linh says. ‚ÄúShe wanted the restaurant so badly that
                        she
                        wanted to drive us out to get it. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs still trying.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre12">I shrug helplessly. I have nothing to use as a
                        counterargument, because it‚Äôs true.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I manage, worried that I‚Äôve ruined things before we could even start
                        working together. In my mind, this newspaper project is like an old rickety bridge above a
                        roaring
                        waterfall. One false move and we‚Äôll tumble over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad at you. It‚Äôs just&mdash;‚Äù She has a faraway look in her eyes. ‚ÄúI
                        wonder what else we‚Äôve been told that turns out to have been a simple rumor that grew into
                        something
                        else.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I lean forward. Careful. ‚ÄúWe can agree that our parents are both protective of
                        the
                        businesses and maybe that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre like this. I know my parents have spent everything on
                        the
                        restaurant. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times they‚Äôve worked through nights just to make ends
                        meet.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh grimaces. ‚ÄúI know. Nights when they probably left us alone more often than
                        they should have.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd when we were too young to stay home by ourselves.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the best-kept secrets in this community.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The bridge is stable again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat was it like for you, growing up in a restaurant?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúAll of my
                        childhood
                        memories seem to have taken place there.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs eyes light up. ‚ÄúLet me guess: It‚Äôs where you‚Äôve watched all segments of
                        <i class="calibre5">Paris by Night</i>? Played lava across the tiles?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes! Getting side-eyed by the regular customers whenever I took over a whole
                        booth.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDid you have a nap room, too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou mean the place where we stored our bags of rice?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It was really like parallel lives. The storage room, with all the rice and
                        nonperishable foods, was where I napped as a kid, and as weird as it was, it still brought me
                        comfort whenever I walked in to grab something. I remember it now&mdash;the hot summers when I
                        wasn‚Äôt yet in school, sleeping on a small cot while my parents were working in the kitchen. A
                        pink
                        fan near the end of its life jaggedly blowing cool air at me. A tiny dictionary that my parents
                        kept
                        there just in case they needed to look up words from the customers&mdash;I‚Äôd look through it
                        when I
                        was bored being out in the main room. A small stool for M·∫π to sit on when she fed me lunch,
                        which
                        happened after naptime.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre12">‚ÄúI guess to answer your question about growing up in the
                        business: It hasn‚Äôt been completely bad. I mean, sometimes I‚Äôd rather be drawing instead of
                        working,
                        but‚Äù&mdash;Linh shrugs&mdash;‚Äúit‚Äôs such a part of my life that I can‚Äôt separate myself from it‚Ä¶
                        as
                        much as I try to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Underneath Linh‚Äôs writing notebook, I spot a sketchbook&mdash;white with a
                        bunch of
                        doodles on it: her artwork. Ignoring her questioning look, I take it from under her arm,
                        examining
                        the drawing, which is similar in style to her family restaurant‚Äôs yer, only this time it‚Äôs of a
                        couple strolling down a brightly lit boulevard in some city. It feels like I‚Äôm there with the
                        couple.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNice. It‚Äôs cool. Looks like New York.‚Äù I slide the sketchbook back at her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been. It‚Äôs just something I pulled from Google images.‚Äù She mumbles
                        the
                        last part, as if she‚Äôs embarrassed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you want to go to New York?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, really. I feel like that‚Äôs what real artists are supposed to do,
                        and
                        I can see why. It‚Äôs probably cool to see all the skyscrapers, stand in Times Square, just seeing
                        all
                        sorts of different people and cultures. But I can‚Äôt even think about that yet. I rst have to
                        figure out
                        a way to tell my parents that I don‚Äôt want to do engineering.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I make a face. Engineering. It seems too boring for Linh. Where would her
                        colors
                        go?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo your parents are the typical Asian parents.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She nods almost morosely.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI think you should be an artist.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A short laugh escapes her and some tension leaves her face. ‚ÄúOkay, sure, that
                        solves <i class="calibre5">everything</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really serious about art. Even when I met you that day. You did some
                        damage
                        to that paper with your crayons.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou were the kid with the bowl cut and weird Spider-Man obsession,‚Äù she
                        recalls,
                        the corners of her eyes crinkling. She‚Äôs smiling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I raise my hands in defense. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you weren‚Äôt obsessed with <i
                            class="calibre5">something</i> when you were younger. Mine just happened to be Spider-Man.
                        You
                        apparently had something against art supplies. Poor crayons.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-82" class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt was a pointillist drawing!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">There‚Äôs a look that people get when they‚Äôre excited&mdash;a spark, I guess, in
                        their eyes. I see it when Vi·ªát‚Äôs face lights up, talking about the latest <i
                            class="calibre5">SVU</i> episode. In M·∫π when she‚Äôs cooking <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>.
                        In
                        Ba whenever good food is involved. Even Allison‚Äôs focused gleam as we‚Äôre in the newsroom comes
                        to
                        mind. Here, with Linh, she has that sort of light behind her eyes. Makes me want to know what
                        that‚Äôs
                        like.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCan you tell me about it? Your art&mdash;like, what it‚Äôs like when you‚Äôre
                        working
                        on something?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh sits back, chewing on a boba. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I go away from my body for a
                        second.
                        It‚Äôs not an out-of-body experience, exactly. Like, I‚Äôm not hovering over my body or anything
                        like
                        that. But I guess I‚Äôm zoned in. And nothing can distract me. Whenever I‚Äôm working on a piece, my
                        mom
                        always complains that I don‚Äôt hear her when it‚Äôs time for dinner.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then the gleam kind of disappears and she has a faraway look in her eyes. She
                        shakes her head, coming back, not telling me where she went, even though I think I know. Her
                        parents
                        probably popped into her mind. ‚ÄúWhat about you? What do you like? Are your parents bugging you
                        to do
                        something you don‚Äôt want to do?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">I shift in my seat. She thinks I‚Äôm kidding, but how do I tell her I‚Äôm not? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere must be something. Cooking?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why I‚Äôm not allowed to stay long in the kitchen.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSure, I can sing a song now, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to traumatize you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSports?‚Äù At my look, Linh sti es a laugh. ‚ÄúWell, who cares if you‚Äôre <i

                    <p id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre12">I shrug and sip my boba loudly. Nothing‚Äôs coming up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
                        not
                        bothered by mediocrity.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMediocrity has allowed me to oat by without too much pressure or judgment.
                        Being
                        mediocre at school is great. No one bothers you! No one even looks at you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying. You <i class="calibre5">so</i> care,‚Äù Linh says it
                        matter-of-factly.
                        Her aim is perfect.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow can you know that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour voice went up a pitch.‚Äù That‚Äôs a very Vi·ªát-like observation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy voice&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh takes a dainty sip of her tea but humor lights up her eyes. Her very <i
                            class="calibre5">nice</i> eyes&mdash;I‚Äôm getting distracted. ‚ÄúYup.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I remember the other night at dinner, when my parents believed in me, maybe too
                        much. I haven‚Äôt done anything so far to give them that much confidence in me. Nothing to make me
                        look
                        good to their customers who always seem to brag about their freakishly talented kids.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So I give in to Linh. Scratching the back of my neck, I admit, ‚ÄúOkay, ne. I‚Äôll
                        try
                        to explain. I look at my parents. I know what they‚Äôve done to get here. It‚Äôs never been easy.
                        And
                        lately I think I‚Äôve been failing them. I haven‚Äôt done completely great in school. And I‚Äôm not
                        breaking any records at sports like my friend Vi·ªát.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCross-country runner?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">That‚Äôs a shocker.</i> ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs him. You follow
                        sports?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh explains after grimacing, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt been forced to listen to Ali reread
                        newspaper articles to you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI would rather run a cross-country race,‚Äù I deadpan. ‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôm feeling the
                        pressure more than usual. It‚Äôs our last year and I guess‚Ä¶‚Äù I breathe out. <i
                            class="calibre5">How
                            should I say this?</i> ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve ignored all the chances around me, and now I don‚Äôt
                        have
                        much to go on.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true!‚Äù Linh says forcefully, leaning forward. ‚ÄúAli and I were
                        talking
                        earlier&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHold on, you were talking about me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Not gonna lie: My self-esteem shoots up.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe was deciding whether or not she hates you.‚Äù She
                        laughs.
                        And my self-esteem plummets. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just joking. She mentioned how you had a good eye for words.
                        Which
                        makes sense, because, you know, not a lot of guys out there say ‚Äòcopacetic.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She tries to mimic my lower voice, and we both know she fails, so we burst out
                        laughing, so loud that we wake the grandpa slumbering in the corner. He glares, then leans his
                        head
                        back again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe you just need to nd something worth writing about. Something that you‚Äôre
                        interested in‚Ä¶ Maybe this‚Äù&mdash;Linh gestures not to us but to the idea of what we‚Äôve agreed to
                        do&mdash;‚Äúis your chance to stand out.‚Äù The future. What a dampener it can be.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh reads the look on my face right away, because she laughs and drops
                        questions
                        about the future.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We finished with our drinks, and the grandpa is actually still awake, now
                        staring at
                        us through suspicious eyes. The place is closing soon. <i class="calibre5">Okay, I get the
                            hint.</i>
                        I lift my cup with the remaining boba and ask Linh, ‚ÄúSo how much should I pay you for this life
                        coaching?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh gives me <i class="calibre5">that</i> smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFree bobas would work just fine.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 14</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Once outside, the silence is comforting and warm, like a good bowl of wonton
                        soup on
                        a rainy day. I feel B·∫£o‚Äôs heat beside me, my hand a whisper away from his. During the summer,
                        with
                        tourists flooding in, this part of the neighborhood gets packed with squatting old Vietnamese
                        women,
                        dressed in countryside out ts. It‚Äôs not as heavy as Bolsa Avenue tra c, especially when the
                        night
                        market‚Äôs up, but it‚Äôs still a tourist trap. You‚Äôre likely to get bullied into buying jackfruit
                        in
                        Styrofoam trays, rambutan or longan, or&mdash;if the woman‚Äôs a <i class="calibre5">really
                            good</i>
                        seller&mdash;durian. Sometimes I wonder if they ever sell all of their items, and when that
                        doesn‚Äôt
                        happen, where they go.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The sight of B·∫£o passing under a lamplight stops me. It‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs just
                        stepped
                        into a Caravaggio painting. The light throws o shadows, darkening half of his body. The lines of
                        his
                        face seem sharper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù B·∫£o brushes his hand through his hair. ‚ÄúDo I have something on my
                        face?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNothing. The lighting. It was just perfect for a second.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou notice things like that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shrug, embarrassed that I was caught staring this time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o hops on a nearby cinder block wall, walking down the length before jumping
                        down, back at my side again. ‚ÄúRemember that bowl of ph·ªü? How bad it was? It‚Äôs probably
                        from&mdash;‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúPh·ªü B√°c H·ªì. My parents hated that place.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSame.‚Äù At least our parents seem to agree on one thing&mdash;a universal
                        distaste
                        for anything that refers to H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh in name. Reminds them too much of the war. The owners
                        made
                        some poor excuse when they opened&mdash;saying they were referring to an elderly relative. But
                        you
                        have to be so ignorant to open something like that here. It closed not long after me and B·∫£o
                        met.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut I never got to see you draw Spider-Man, did I?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause of our parents.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Something passes in his eyes that makes me shiver. ‚ÄúDid you ever think about
                        what
                        it would have been like if our restaurants weren‚Äôt competing against each other?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs a loaded question to wrap up our time together, but I answer as honestly
                        as I
                        can.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI think I thought about the idea of you, if that makes sense. But this is
                        different. I finally get a chance to know you&mdash;and you seem nice.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, the nice-guy act disappears once we meet for the fourth time.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGreat. I was really sensing asshole vibes back there.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It feels like an hour before we finally get to Ward Street, where our paths
                        diverge.
                        This is what I‚Äôll remember: his bashful wave and the shadows swallowing him up as he heads home.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When I‚Äôm inside the house, only Ba is up. Back problems, most likely. I can
                        smell
                        the Bengay emanating from him again. He sits in the dark living room, TV on, but with the cable
                        o .
                        The static from the screen lights up his sleeping face, a hypnotizing pattern.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, <i class="calibre5">con v·ªÅ r·ªìi</i>?‚Äù he asks groggily, stating the
                        obvious.
                        ‚ÄúHow was studying?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">D·∫°</i>. It went well.‚Äù The lie leaves me a bit too easily,
                        though I feel the weight of it in my stomach. But it has to be done. I take o my shoes, then
                        make my
                        way to my bedroom. ‚ÄúThe test will be easy. Now go to sleep.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAh.‚Äù I‚Äôll give him two more hours before he drags himself to bed and wakes up
                        early to start his routine again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">My mom‚Äôs knock wakes me up the next morning. My mouth‚Äôs parched, and the light
                        almost hurts my eyes. I remember that I didn‚Äôt drink any water after drinking boba. Is it
                        possible
                        to be hungover from too much boba?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre12">I hear M·∫π lightly pad across my room. Her
                        shampoo&mdash;Head
                        &amp; Shoulders, which she shares with Ba&mdash;tickles my nose. The bed sags just a bit when
                        she
                        sits by me, patting my side. This was how she‚Äôd wake me and Evie up before heading o to a long
                        day
                        at the restaurant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Con, d·∫≠y ƒëi. Ch√≠n gi·ªù r·ªìi</i>,‚Äù she whispers, her voice as
                        smooth as the glide of a brushstroke across a well-primed canvas.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I twist my head to the right and check the actual time: eight o‚Äôclock, instead
                        of
                        an hour later like she just said.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFive more minutes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π just made <i class="calibre5">b√°nh pat√™ s√¥</i>. Just hot out of the oven.
                        It‚Äôs
                        only good when it‚Äôs eaten hot.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I breathe in hints of her promise. Buttery pu pastry. Tender, flavorful chicken
                        at
                        the center. And then my ultimate favorite: earthy Vietnamese co ee just waiting to be paired o
                        with
                        sweetened condensed milk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Okay, I‚Äôm up.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π knows she has me. I hear a smile in her voice. ‚ÄúSee you soon.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Once in the kitchen, I see that it‚Äôs not just pastry or co ee that she‚Äôs made.
                        She
                        must be experimenting with recipes. Several pots are cooking on the stove, and on the outside
                        patio,
                        there are two larger pots, which tells me whatever she‚Äôs cooking there might stink up the house.
                        Various herbs are soaking in tubs of water. At last ve bottles and jars of <i
                            class="calibre5">gia
                            v·ªã</i> are opened on the kitchen table. Ever-methodical in the restaurant kitchen, she‚Äôs the
                        complete opposite in our own kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Still, I love mornings like this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The pastry is waiting just for me. I sink my teeth into it, fakes falling into
                        my
                        lap. M·∫π has me taste the co ee and milk level, then pours ice over it. As M·∫π busies herself
                        around
                        the kitchen, I FaceTime Evie, who complains that while other parents have sent their kids care
                        packages, M·∫π and Ba haven‚Äôt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCare package, what is that?‚Äù M·∫π asks&mdash;or shouts, as the blender breaks
                        down
                        some spices. Evie quickly explains the concept, to which M·∫π says that Vietnamese food, the good
                        kind, can‚Äôt ever be mailed.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre12">Meanwhile my hands are getting tired holding the phone so
                        they
                        can see each other.</p>

                        loves
                        eating pig ears. Not real pig ears, but sugary biscuits that are shaped like them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, if you want, I will make them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it if you‚Äôre too busy.‚Äù She points out that M·∫π shouldn‚Äôt be cooking
                        on
                        her day o . ‚ÄúWeekends are for fun. For people to do a hobby or something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, like gardening,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo way. Every time M·∫π tries to grow something, she kills it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSomething is wrong with our soil,‚Äù M·∫π protests lightly as she grabs something
                        from
                        the drawer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Evie and I exchange knowing looks. Makes me feel like she‚Äôs not hours away. In
                        our
                        small backyard, there‚Äôs a graveyard of plants M·∫π tried to grow: tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers.
                        The
                        only thing that has survived are herbs, though it‚Äôs only a small selection.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSure, M·∫π. Sure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Evie says she‚Äôs going on a run next and would text later. Once she‚Äôs gone, M·∫π
                        asks
                        me worriedly, ‚ÄúDoes she sound happy? Does she look thinner to you? Maybe she doesn‚Äôt have enough
                        to
                        eat.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When we moved Evie into the dorms, we had more food than anything else for her.
                        Luckily her roommate is Filipino, so she and her parents merely congratulated my parents on
                        their
                        preparedness. Then Ba told them to stop by our restaurant if they were ever in the area. That
                        was
                        when Evie decided it was time to say goodbye.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π, she‚Äôs ne. She seems really happy. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúM√† M·∫π l√† M·∫π. M·∫π ph·∫£i lo.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I get up from the table, finished with breakfast. I hug my mom from behind.
                        ‚ÄúYeah,
                        but Evie‚Äôs got this. She can take care of herself. You know how she is.‚Äù At that, M·∫π only sighs
                        deeply, and my body mimics the movement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you miss her?‚Äù she asks me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSometimes.‚Äù And that‚Äôs the truth of it. I thought it‚Äôd be much weirder to go
                        home
                        to a half-empty bedroom. But over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve gotten used to it. I think of my aunt
                        and
                        the packages she sends M·∫π. I look at her longingly staring out the window over the sink, the
                        light
                        showing that M·∫π seems to have a few more gray hairs than I remember. ‚ÄúDo you miss D√¨ V√†ng?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre12">‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù she says quietly. She doesn‚Äôt elaborate, and
                        I‚Äôm
                        wondering if she‚Äôs going into one of her moods.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I let go and ask if I can help with anything.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, there‚Äôs too much to do. I should do it myself. Why don‚Äôt you do your
                        homework
                        and if you have finished, go to your <i class="calibre5">hobby</i>,‚Äù M·∫π says, trying to mimic
                        the way
                        Evie says it, but she ends up sounding nasally.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I bite my tongue, feeling like that‚Äôs how my parents will always see painting
                        for
                        me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs just a suggestion, she probably thinks nothing of it, but the easy
                        dismissal
                        of my hobby makes the taste of <i class="calibre5">pat√™ s√¥</i> linger uncomfortably on my
                        tongue.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou really should nd something else to do, M·∫π. You work too much.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd work is good. Work makes money.‚Äù As she opens the blender to peer at its
                        contents, she says, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had a hobby since I was a teenager. Your age.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat did you like to do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A wistful look passes through her eyes. ‚ÄúTravel. When I wasn‚Äôt at school or
                        helping
                        out around the house, I‚Äôd go around Nha Trang to places I‚Äôd never been. I would travel to Saigon
                        and
                        ƒê√† L·∫°t. Oh, ƒê√† L·∫°t was so beautiful! So romantic!‚Äù She laughs. ‚ÄúAnd when we escaped, my rst wish
                        was
                        that we‚Äôd land somewhere in Europe.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHave you traveled since?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, no. Where was the money? <i class="calibre5">ƒê·ªùi s·ªëng ƒë√£ r·∫•t l√† kh√≥.</i> I
                        had
                        to work in factories, the nail salon, wherever I could get work. School wasn‚Äôt a priority since
                        we
                        needed money. Traveling was a foolish idea. An impossible idea.‚Äù She shakes her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat is why I‚Äôm happy to see Evie nd her way. She will live a life that‚Äôs not
                        <i class="calibre5">kh√≥</i>. Unlike I had. Unlike your aunt.‚Äù Her tone shifts to one of
                        disapproval. ‚ÄúAnd soon enough you will have a good life too.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">A good life.</i> A good life only comes if you have
                        security&mdash;that‚Äôs what my mom‚Äôs basically saying. Anything beyond that is just a pipe dream.

                        me consistently is M·∫π, through Ba, and if she wanted me to actually wake up, she wouldn‚Äôt be

                        Really. Because they‚Äôre weird and obsessed, and they like to bring me into their odd hobbies.
                        And
                        maybe, in an odd way, it‚Äôs their attempt to compromise. I‚Äôd always wanted to eat out:
                        McDonald‚Äôs.
                        KFC. Red Robin. When I begged and begged, my mom‚Äôs reply was always the same. That it was a

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOne of our customers mentioned it in passing,‚Äù M·∫π says. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt worry: That

                    <p class="calibre12">We pull into the parking lot of a plaza. The restaurant‚Äôs surrounded by upscale
                        jewelry stores and ‚Äúelite‚Äù nail salons, and that con rms&mdash;at least to me&mdash; that the
                        restaurant won‚Äôt be legit. It‚Äôs all too‚Ä¶ new. Too shiny. Where are the errant shopping bags
                        rolling
                        along with the breeze? Discarded rinds from clementines or lychees?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This is what happens when we step inside ‚Äúphotastic.‚Äù Purposely all lowercase.

                    <p class="calibre12">Everything in the restaurant is white: the walls, the tiles, the tables, and
                        chairs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Even the host is white, wearing a T-shirt printed with a poorly drawn <span

                        Where‚Äôs the red? And yellow? Fake flowers? The floor that‚Äôs seen better days?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúChao, Bac!‚Äù</i> says the host, missing the tones
                        completely.
                        He has the audacity to bow. ‚ÄúTable for three?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Dumbstruck, my parents nod. Even though the waiter‚Äôs annoying me, I almost
                        laugh at
                        my parents being speechless for once.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Not for long, at least.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúA white waiter?‚Äù M·∫π hisses after we get our menus. We sit in the center at a
                        round
                        table that Ba moves around to see if it‚Äôs lopsided. It‚Äôs not, which, to me, makes this place
                        even
                        more inauthentic. ‚ÄúSpeaking horrible Vietnamese, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe can always turn around,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ba says firmly and calmly, pushing a menu to me and M·∫π. ‚ÄúThis is

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We fall silent when the waiter&mdash;John, because of course&mdash;returns
                        again.
                        He asks if we‚Äôre ready to order and Ba <i class="calibre5">actually</i> pulls out a list of menu
                        items and reads them off.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">See: research.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When the confusion dawns on John‚Äôs face, my stomach drops.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sir. Can you repeat that?‚Äù John looks to me, like I‚Äôm expected to
                        translate for Ba. I look away from him, wanting to prolong his misery. We get this a lot when we
                        go
                        out to non-Vietnamese places&mdash;and maybe this is why we don‚Äôt go out often. Obviously, my
                        dad‚Äôs
                        accent gives him away. He wasn‚Äôt born here like me. But even though I understand him perfectly,
                        sometimes he gets nervous&mdash;but doesn‚Äôt want to say so&mdash;and he speaks quickly. When I
                        was a
                        kid &mdash;bowl-cut me, let‚Äôs just say&mdash;it was embarrassing. Maybe it was the look others
                        gave
                        him, or the visible discomfort in my parents.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now I‚Äôm just annoyed by people like John.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba clears his throat, sits up straighter in his seat. ‚ÄúCo ee. For the three of
                        us.‚Äù
                        He slows his words as he relays the rest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, yes, sorry.‚Äù The red in the waiter‚Äôs ears&mdash;now he‚Äôs
                        embarrassed&mdash;fades while he jots down the order.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The time waiting for our food consists of my mom and dad‚Äôs airing their
                        complaints
                        against the place. Seems like we‚Äôre the only Vietnamese family here. The lights are too bright.
                        They
                        gave us ‚Äúorganic‚Äù <i class="calibre5">c√† ph√™ s·ªØa ƒë√°</i> that was already served in a glass with
                        ice.
                        Real Vietnamese restaurants make the customers do their own work. The only concession is
                        good-looking waiters&mdash;one, as my mom points out, resembles a K-pop star.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then the food comes. Turns out, even a kid who didn‚Äôt grow up in a restaurant
                        could
                        tell this wasn‚Äôt any legit Vietnamese restaurant. General atmosphere aside, the kitchen was only
                        doing a poor imitation of the Vi·ªát food I recognize. The <i class="calibre5">c∆°m chi√™n</i>
                        doesn‚Äôt
                        have Chinese sausage&mdash;what kind of fried rice dish is this? Other crimes include
                        oversalting
                        the ph·ªü and not crisping up the</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre15">sh enough.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">D·ªü ·∫πc!</i>‚Äù my mother says, a look of disgust on her face
                        as
                        she sorts through the mushy sh. She‚Äôd already removed the bones and they slid o suspiciously
                        cleanly. If it were really done well, the bones would refuse to come o , and you‚Äôd have no
                        choice
                        but to use a hand and chopstick pair to remove them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo doubt, this restaurant will close within a few months,‚Äù Ba finally says,
                        pushing
                        away his unfinished plate. I repeat: unfinished.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs text about our rst assignment comes to mind. I ask my parents if I could
                        duck out of my shift early next week. And then the interrogation happens.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI have a newspaper assignment.‚Äù</p>

                        to

                        something.‚Äù Using my chopsticks, I stu a bite of white rice in my mouth, trying to act casual.
                        Too

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou did like reading dictionaries as a kid,‚Äù Ba concedes. Turning to my mom,
                        his

                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π catches on, her preoccupation flying away. ‚ÄúHa! Like that would happen.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFunny, guys. Funny. Girls like me!‚Äù I decide to play along. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs at least

                        liking me sends my parents laughing. Even I‚Äôm joining in. Me and Kelly, the girl who despises me
                        for
                        avoiding VSA duties like the plague?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre12">Later, I won‚Äôt be able to explain why I said what I said
                        next.
                        Maybe it‚Äôs a slip of the tongue, or because it‚Äôs a notion even more ridiculous than Kelly,
                        Fiona, or
                        Cindy having a crush on me. Right after Cindy, Linh‚Äôs name slips through my lips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A dark expression crosses my mom‚Äôs face, like clouds engulfing the sun. ‚ÄúLinh

                    <p class="calibre12">There‚Äôs a dangerous tone in her question, and I immediately retreat. ‚ÄúJust
                        kidding.

                    <p class="calibre12">Acting: not my career path. My parents continue glaring at me stonily, the
                        playful
                        mood from before gone. ‚ÄúSeriously, I‚Äôm not seeing anyone. I really am on assignment for the

                    <p class="calibre12">This causes my mother to lean back, shoulders relaxing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A different waiter has come back&mdash;mixed, Vietnamese and white, maybe. Her

                    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5">All the guys here have perfect hair.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That‚Äôs my rst observation as I walk into the restaurant that Ali had assigned
                        us.
                        The host disarms me with his bright smile as he greets me in Japanese. Average height, he‚Äôs
                        still
                        made tiny by the large wooden desk that he stands behind. The divider‚Äôs just low enough to let
                        me
                        see the waiters walking around, their polished hair&mdash;many of them with the hair of a
                        Silicon
                        Valley guy post-startup phase. Many immaculate man-buns, which the host also has. I‚Äôd look
                        ridiculous if I tried wearing my hair like that.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre12">Linh hasn‚Äôt arrived yet, and in various hand gestures, I
                        let
                        the host know that I‚Äôll wait for a few seconds. Looking up: stalactites&mdash;thin wooden
                        structures
                        jutting down from the ceiling, painted to mimic the top parts of northern Japanese hemlocks.
                        Somewhere in my research about this place, I remember seeing that the chef is from Kyushu,
                        specifically Fukuoka. Maybe this art was inspired by his home. I sneak my notepad from my back
                        jeans
                        pocket&mdash;Ali forced it on me, saying it‚Äôd make me look more ‚Äúlegit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I turn to the mirrors functioning as walls. Strands of hair still stick out no
                        matter how much gel I use. I‚Äôm so preoccupied that I don‚Äôt notice Linh sneaking up on me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She arches an eyebrow. ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ hair,‚Äù I manage to articulate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her mouth moves like she‚Äôs fighting words back. Or a smile. ‚ÄúIt looks ne.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We let the host know that we‚Äôre from La Quinta, and as Ali promised, the
                        restaurant
                        was expecting us. Ken, the host, leads us past the dividers. While the waiting room transports
                        you
                        to a different height, the main dining room brings you back to the ground, literally. The oor
                        takes
                        on the cool colors of a modern city; the walls, the outlines of high-rise buildings, adorned and
                        labeled with the sleekness of kanji. Japanese pop music brings an intimate, personal vibe that
                        calms
                        me immediately. It reminds me of seeing out the last customers for the day, of the feeling right
                        before I throw myself into bed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The other diners are mostly Asian&mdash;a good sign&mdash;and aged young. We
                        don‚Äôt
                        recognize anyone, which makes sense since it‚Äôs a city away. We get seated, and I sneak a look at
                        Linh smiling and nodding at the waitress who swooped in. Linh asks about the artwork, sparking
                        life
                        into the waitress‚Äôs eyes. Maybe she‚Äôs an artist, too. I take down parts of the conversation: her
                        uncle‚Äôs the chef and yes, he wanted the restaurant decor to be an homage to his home island.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe were just fixated on the idea that art can say so much about family
                        history.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI totally understand! I‚Äôm working on something similar.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre12">I make a note to ask about that. When the waitress leaves,
                        though, we‚Äôre alone, forced to look at each other, and suddenly my ability to speak has
                        retreated
                        somewhere else. Our time at the boba shop might as well have been a dream. I resist the urge to
                        straighten the bottle of soy sauce between us, just to do <i class="calibre5">something</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been taking notes already?‚Äù Linh nods at the notepad next to me. ‚ÄúI
                        brought
                        mine, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">From her small backpack, she pulls out her sketchbook that I saw in the boba
                        shop.
                        I watch her hands, faint paint still on her fingers. A trademark. Linh notices, glancing down,
                        and
                        tries to hide it. ‚ÄúSorry, I was trying to t in some painting time before and probably should
                        have
                        washed it o better.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs all good. It‚Äôs very‚Ä¶ you. You know, being an artist and all that.‚Äù I
                        see
                        the same expression from before, like she doesn‚Äôt quite know how to read me, so I rush to add,
                        ‚ÄúAnyway, yeah, I only took a few notes so far. I had to Google how to write a food review.
                        That‚Äôs
                        the level of confidence I have right now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh laughs, sitting back. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a tip. I‚Äôve learned in reading art reviews
                        that
                        the best reviews aren‚Äôt just about the art or whether it‚Äôs good or not. It‚Äôs also how other
                        patrons
                        will react to it. What meaning the art piece might have to others.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood to know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have any issue at all on the food part, though. I mean, we grew up
                        in
                        the business. We know good food, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her words summon into memory our rst meeting&mdash;the rst time we reviewed
                        something together in a way. I crack a smile, relaxing a bit more. We take a few minutes with
                        the
                        menu before ordering a tempura assortment, shrimp and vegetable, to share, then ordering
                        ramen&mdash;<i class="calibre5">tonkatsu</i> ramen for me and spicy miso ramen for Linh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Linh says, stitching together her fingers and leaning forward. ‚ÄúWhat kind
                        of
                        place is perfect for a date? Maybe it‚Äôd help to think about that as you review it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Of course, to contribute to my under-qualifications&mdash;add the fact that
                        I‚Äôve
                        never been on a date, either. Unless you count one lunch with a girl at Burger King during a
                        sixth-grade eld trip.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre12">Which I tell Linh, and she just laughs. She‚Äôd probably
                        gone on
                        more dates than me. Most of my classmates probably have, too. So it shocks me when she says,
                        ‚ÄúI‚Äôve
                        never been a date either. So I guess we‚Äôre even.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs comforting.‚Äù I pick up my pencil, tapping it against my notebook.
                        ‚ÄúDates
                        have to be somewhere you can actually get to know someone. Like us right now.‚Äù I wish I could
                        take
                        the words back. <i class="calibre5">Does she think that</i> I <i class="calibre5">think this is
                            a
                            date?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But Linh doesn‚Äôt seem to notice, adding, ‚ÄúThe noise level has to be just right
                        so
                        that it‚Äôs an actual conversation. Like, if someone is speaking quietly, you should still be able
                        to
                        hear that person.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDimly lit atmosphere with a noise level that‚Äôs perfect for conversations and
                        whispers,‚Äù I say aloud as I write.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I feel like she means it. We go back and forth with other requirements of a
                        ‚Äúperfect date‚Äù: a nice seating or standing arrangement; an activity that both people like and
                        could
                        talk about later. The waitress drops by with our appetizer, then disappears again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUltimately, I think both people on the date need to be comfortable, as if you
                        could literally share everything and anything. Which is why the setting matters,‚Äù Linh says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Our waitress shows up again with a bowl, her fellow waiter tagging along with
                        another bowl. I make a note about the short waiting time. I start salivating the moment the
                        aroma
                        wafts from my ramen&mdash;intense and smoky. It doesn‚Äôt disappoint. The rst spoonful of broth
                        coats
                        my tongue in a silky layer, and the noodles are still rm yet give way easily under my teeth. The
                        egg
                        is sweet and salty, soaked in umami.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRemind me to thank Ali,‚Äù Linh says into her spoon. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like most other
                        ramen, which goes overboard with the salt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood ramen doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre drowning in a bowl of salt,‚Äù I pretend to
                        write. ‚ÄúYou want to trade for a second?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We exchange bowls, keeping our utensils. Linh pauses and blows on her broth.
                        ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">ƒÇn ƒëi, con</i>,‚Äù I say, mimicking countless cousins or aunts at family
                        gatherings who are almost always chasing an impossible toddler to feed.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs now midbite but she laughs, then covers her mouth.
                        ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt! You just made me spit!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOn a date, it‚Äôs important not to sit across from anyone who spits,‚Äù I add to
                        my
                        invisible list.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh telepathically lets me know to shut up. Her ramen is pleasantly spicy, the
                        texture of the broth similar to mine, the kind that sits comfortably on the tongue, doesn‚Äôt
                        attack
                        you.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My earlier nervousness is completely gone now as we alternate the time eating,
                        describing our food, and complaining about school and balancing working at the restaurants. She
                        talks about how her parents set her up with an engineering student they know so she can ask
                        questions. Which is a good idea&mdash; and I hope my parents don‚Äôt think of it. I‚Äôm ne with
                        limiting
                        the times I disappoint someone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh takes pictures of her ramen, and she starts with her sketch of the
                        restaurant,
                        outlining the most prominent parts: the walls, tables, and chairs. ‚ÄúFor size comparison.‚Äù Her
                        pencil
                        seems to oat above the page instead of touching it and she falls silent now, locked in her
                        world. A
                        world I‚Äôm finally getting a look at.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Watching Linh‚Äôs thoughts play across her face is‚Ä¶ interesting. I remember how
                        she
                        looked that night, distress rippling across her face, the indecision as her eyes fitted between
                        me
                        and the restaurant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">For years, my parents‚Äô issues with her family were a separate, weird thing that
                        I‚Äôd
                        accepted, one of their many oddities&mdash;like their near-worship of lottery numbers, their
                        insistence with each wrong number that they were <i class="calibre5">just</i> about to give that
                        number. Or M·∫π‚Äôs tendency to use me or my dad to get a double-tasting of samples at the
                        supermarket.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow can your parents <i class="calibre5">not</i> want you to be an artist?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt mean to disrupt her, but it pulls her out of her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI guess it doesn‚Äôt feel stable to them. My parents aren‚Äôt really about making
                        tons
                        of money. It‚Äôs about making just enough to sustain themselves. They didn‚Äôt have that when they
                        came
                        over, so they wanted it for me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThey escaped too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThey escaped,‚Äù she con rms. ‚ÄúBy boat.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre12">I spoon some of my remaining broth, watching the surface
                        ripple. All my life, I thought it was normal that my mom and dad had left by sea. They‚Äôd known
                        each
                        other growing up and left in the same boat owned by the second cousin of a mutual friend. Their
                        connection to this boat owner might have been loose, but they were past caring. Trustworthiness
                        during this time was a messy ideal anyway. They just had to leave. But after hearing
                        conversations
                        from my mom‚Äôs friends, conversations with other Vi·ªát kids at school, families came another way:
                        through sponsorship, through marriage.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But I feel like it does say something about the type of people my parents are
                        &mdash;Linh‚Äôs parents, too&mdash;to put trust in the unknowable sea, in the people who navigated
                        the
                        boats to the ultimate destination. Survivors.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt tell your parents about wanting to be an artist because they
                        don‚Äôt
                        see it as a viable career.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh nods. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I have to keep it a secret. Some secrets are good. They
                        can
                        be helpful.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúStill, it‚Äôs hard to keep a secret.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">You‚Äôre</i> keeping a secret. You haven‚Äôt exactly told your
                        parents that you‚Äôre working with me on this newspaper assignment.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs not the same thing, but I can‚Äôt figure out how to say it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMe and my art&mdash;I‚Äôm not really lying. I‚Äôm downplaying it,‚Äù Linh continues.
                        She
                        fiddles with the end of a chopstick, not looking at me now. Somehow I feel as if I‚Äôve stepped
                        over an
                        invisible line. ‚ÄúOkay, I guess it‚Äôs hiding. But it‚Äôs necessary!‚Äù She directs the last line at
                        me,
                        suddenly insistent. ‚ÄúFirst of all, you‚Äôre a guy, so you probably get away with a lot of things.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I open my mouth to argue, but I remember a cousin at a gathering complaining
                        that
                        her brother had a later curfew because he was a guy. ‚ÄúOkay, I see that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut my parents are pretty much insistent that I do <i
                            class="calibre5">anything</i> but be an artist. To do this, I have to lie. There‚Äôs no other
                        way,
                        really,‚Äù Linh says, defensiveness seeping in at the edges. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not usually a liar.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not calling you a&mdash;I‚Äôm just saying.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs my fault things went a little sour. Linh‚Äôs now avoiding further
                        conversation
                        by zoning in on her sketchbook. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ne.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre12">Later, our goodbye is less hopeful than our last one the
                        night we had boba.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This isn‚Äôt a date, so why does it feel like I messed everything up?</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt know I was liar. But to hear someone else agree with
                        that?
                        It‚Äôs piercing. Especially coming from B·∫£o, because as much as I dislike the label, I know he‚Äôs
                        right. Lying to maintain stability. Lying to make sure my parents aren‚Äôt worrying about me or
                        nagging me because they already have to do that as parents. In a way, isn‚Äôt this saving my
                        parents
                        from grief? He‚Äôs doing it, too. That‚Äôs the only reason why we‚Äôre able to do this whole food

                    <p class="calibre12">I yell in frustration, glad to have the house to myself for an hour. My parents
                        are
                        still at the restaurant. My sketch from earlier tonight is beside me, nearly done. I just have
                        to
                        add more depth perception. I run my hand across its rough texture.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o can‚Äôt know the pressure. From what I can tell, his parents aren‚Äôt forcing
                        him
                        to be something&mdash;they just want him to nd his path, which he said he couldn‚Äôt see, but
                        observing him tonight, writing seems to come naturally to him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I force down the sudden spike of jealousy; his parents are clearly different
                        from
                        mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It felt normal in the beginning. If other people were looking in, we probably
                        seemed like two high school students on a real date. When I‚Äôm with Ali, I can talk about a lot
                        of
                        things, but she can‚Äôt understand being raised the way me and Evie were. We grew up differently.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I smile at the memory of watching him try to tame his hair. He didn‚Äôt know I
                        was
                        there. I can‚Äôt be sure, but I feel as if his hair is the type to grow faster than it should. I
                        like
                        it long, better than his bowl cut&mdash;for obvious reasons. It‚Äôs the kind of hair that‚Äôd be
                        easy to
                        run through with your hands.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre12">My hand. I glance down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In my reverie, I was starting to outline the shape of his head. I rub at the
                        image,
                        smudging the lines.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But of course I botched the conversation. I panicked when he pressed me about
                        lying. The moment he mentioned lying, I denied it, but I was denying the truth. I shouldn‚Äôt have
                        shut down. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if B·∫£o told Ali the next day that he can‚Äôt work the beat
                        anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôd be another lie to say that that wouldn‚Äôt hurt me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow was dinner with Ali?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Flipping over my sketchbook, even though there‚Äôs nothing to give me away, I
                        look
                        up. Right: my excuse. M·∫π had come back from work at some point. I hear Ba over in their room,
                        opening and closing drawers, getting ready for bed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood. We ate ramen.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π makes a face. She‚Äôs not a huge fan, claiming it‚Äôs too salty for her taste.
                        As
                        she comes over, I shove the sketchbook under my pillow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π missed a call from D√¨ V√†ng. Let‚Äôs see why she called.‚Äù M·∫π sits on my bed,
                        and
                        scoots back so that she‚Äôs against the wall like me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">After a few rings on Viber, my aunt appears onscreen in all of her familiar
                        late-morning, <i class="calibre5">I was sculpting all last night for fun</i> grogginess. Her
                        large
                        black-rimmed glasses sit at the end of her nose. She‚Äôs still in her pajamas, light green
                        elephants
                        printed on the sleeves. My mom has a similar set; the material is perfect for the heat here,
                        too. D√¨
                        V√†ng is in her apartment‚Äôs kitchen, a cup of <i class="calibre5">c√† ph√™ ƒëen</i> beside her. If I
                        strain enough I might be able to hear the motorcycles outside her window, some neighborhood
                        women
                        laughing, loitering on the sidewalk, or a vendor hawking sh or fresh veggies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDid you just wake up?‚Äù my mom asks. It‚Äôs eleven in the morning over there, too
                        late for M·∫π‚Äôs typical wake-up time at dawn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù <i class="calibre5">Knew it.</i> My aunt makes a show of yawning and
                        stretching. ‚ÄúWhat did you eat for dinner?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLeftovers. And you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre12">I roll my eyes. They say hi and immediately ask about
                        food?
                        My aunt points the phone downward to show her plate of <i class="calibre5">·ªëp la&mdash;</i>fried
                        eggs, the yolk runny once pierced&mdash;with <i class="calibre5">b√°nh m√¨</i>, likely fresh from

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the <i class="calibre5">x√¨ d·∫ßu</i>?‚Äù M·∫π asks almost accusingly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCh·ªã trying to diet. Less salt. It‚Äôs perfectly ne without it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou sound M·ªπ,‚Äù M·∫π says. I grin, thinking about how much my mom acts like the
                        older
                        sister even though she isn‚Äôt. My aunt knows how to take it, though, shooting back playful
                        replies.
                        Oh yes, I can see it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs happening? You don‚Äôt usually call me. It‚Äôs the other way around.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDid you get my vase?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes. You shouldn‚Äôt have sent it. It costs so much money to ship things over.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI wanted to give you something nice! But if you‚Äôre that worried about money,
                        maybe
                        I should just deliver my next one to you myself.‚Äù D√¨ V√†ng leans closer, grinning now. Her eyes
                        are
                        alive.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Does she mean‚Ä¶ ?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you coming here?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù I ask, pulling the phone from M·∫π‚Äôs hand. She snatches it back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming here, really?‚Äù she asks again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs been way too long. Twelve, thirteen years?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhen are you coming?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAround T·∫øt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre leaving around T·∫øt? But why? It‚Äôs the best holiday. Tra c will be
                        horrible.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">D√¨ V√†ng laughs. ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôre already worrying about the travel schedule!
                        Anyway, I‚Äôve seen so many T·∫øt; I live here. Plus it‚Äôs been so long! I want to see you. I want to
                        hug
                        Evie and Linh!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be the only reason.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI also might be visiting some artist friends on the West Coast.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou have friends here?‚Äù I ask, though I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. When she
                        visited
                        the last time, she managed to make conversation with everyone on the</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">oor of our old apartment building, people my parents and I never even</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">interacted with. She even met B√°c Xu√¢n when he came by, and in no time they were
                        trading hypotheticals on what he would do when he retired and moved closer to his adult children
                        and
                        their families.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre12">‚ÄúI have friends all over the place. I‚Äôm international.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre coming,‚Äù I say excitedly. It‚Äôll be two artists under

                        roof. We‚Äôll go to museums, I‚Äôll show her my work. Someone who will understand my language. And
                        support it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you have enough money to go traveling?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">D√¨ V√†ng tuts at my mom. ‚ÄúOf course I do. My business is good over here; I wish
                        you

                        missed.
                        ‚ÄúI am no longer a struggling artist, as you seem to think I will always be.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve struggled for a long time, I remember.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π holds back whatever thought she has and they move on to talking about old
                        friends, some woman they knew who‚Äôd eloped in H·ªôi An, then came back without the husband
                        recently. I
                        sit there, silent, content to listen, eyes tracking the level of my aunt‚Äôs co ee as she sips
                        away at
                        it. Then M·∫π notices my eyes closing slowly. The ramen is finally kicking in, lulling me to
                        sleep.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, <i class="calibre5">cho</i> Linh <i class="calibre5">ƒëi ng·ªß</i>.‚Äù They
                        exchange goodbyes, my aunt saying she‚Äôd circle back with more info about her visit next year.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π only sighs as she maneuvers herself o my bed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBe happy, M·∫π!‚Äù I say, holding on to my mom‚Äôs arm before she leaves, trying to
                        get
                        her not to worry already. ‚ÄúYour sister‚Äôs coming over.‚Äù I see a hint of a smile blooming on her
                        face,
                        though she stops herself, shooing away my hand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs thinking. She‚Äôs so unpredictable. And she

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWas it really that bad? D√¨ V√†ng and her sculpting business.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe‚Äôd just started it when she was seventeen right after leaving school. Then

                        My mom fiddles with the back of her phone cover. ‚ÄúMany times D√¨ V√†ng would come home without

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre12">‚ÄúLuckily, we had older aunts and uncles who would come in

                        there
                        was no time for playing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAt the camps, when M·∫π finally made it&mdash;just <i class="calibre5">m∆∞·ªùi hai

                    <p class="calibre12">My mom was fourteen by the time they left the camps and were accepted into the
                        United States with her cousins and two other refugees they‚Äôd grown close to. But she couldn‚Äôt
                        depend
                        on her cousins alone&mdash;they too were thrust into an unfamiliar place with minimal
                        English&mdash;and finding work was hard. So, when she wasn‚Äôt studying to catch up at school, she
                        was
                        working odd jobs. Some of the money went to their daily expenses. Whatever was left over she‚Äôd
                        send
                        back to Vietnam, to help my aunt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAh, <i class="calibre5">M·∫π nh·ª©c ƒë·∫ßu</i>,‚Äù she says, massaging her temples,
                        worries
                        about my aunt plaguing her mind. Then she‚Äôs o to the next room, muttering about how much she‚Äôll
                        need
                        to clean up to accommodate her sister coming over, despite us having plenty of time to prepare.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I still don‚Äôt understand. My aunt seems so happy, and she‚Äôs managed to get this
                        far, and it can‚Äôt all be because she gets some money now and then from America. She‚Äôs not
                        struggling
                        like before, so why can‚Äôt my mom see that it all turned out okay in the end? It‚Äôs like the

                        of my aunt‚Äôs struggle keep her from seeing the good sides to art.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I pull out my sketchpad from its hiding place and trace over the image of B·∫£o.

                    <h3>Chapter 17</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs not really unusual for kids who grew up in restaurants to eat in record
                        time.
                        M·∫π had to feed us before the rush hour or else there wouldn‚Äôt be another opportunity. And now,
                        working at the restaurant, when noon hits, when customers come owing in, we need to eat quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo, what, you think she‚Äôs mad at you, then?‚Äù Vi·ªát asks, scraping the last of
                        his
                        egg noodles from his Styrofoam plate. An apple sits on his left, a strawberry yogurt that he
                        won‚Äôt
                        eat to his right. He hates artificial sugar. I‚Äôd told him about the restaurant, how things had
                        started out ne. Fun, even, until Linh shut down on me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI guess so. Maybe because I basically called her a liar.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát shakes his head, like, <i class="calibre5">You poor kid.</i> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt
                        know,
                        man. It‚Äôs hypocritical. I mean, you‚Äôre lying about where you‚Äôre going and who you‚Äôre spending
                        time
                        with, too. And why‚Äôs that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I see his point now. ‚ÄúSo my parents don‚Äôt blow up on me. My mom, especially.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Vi·ªát says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it like that, though. I was just saying‚Ä¶ I wish her parents
                        could
                        see what she‚Äôs doing. Because she‚Äôs an artist. She can‚Äôt be anything else.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd you know this after only a few weeks of talking to her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Okay, he‚Äôs looking at me like I‚Äôm obsessed with her.</i>
                        ‚ÄúShut
                        up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát grins in return, biting into an apple. ‚ÄúThis is the rst time I‚Äôve heard
                        you
                        talk about a girl, let alone the daughter of your family‚Äôs worst enemy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd ever give me advice about talking to a girl.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre12">My best friend merely shrugs. ‚ÄúWhenever I take a break
                        from
                        watching <i class="calibre5">Law &amp; Order</i> or <i class="calibre5">Criminal Minds</i>, I
                        sometimes ip to <i class="calibre5">The Bachelor</i>, which tells me exactly what not to do when
                        talking to a girl you like.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Sure, very reliable.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, dude. Maybe next time you see her, try to apologize. Let her
                        deal
                        with her parents at her own pace.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When Vi·ªát‚Äôs cross-country friends join our table, our abnormal conversation
                        ends.
                        It‚Äôs a brief respite since I have my limits with their circular conversations about sprint
                        times,
                        better sprint times, and plans for another pasta party before a meet. And I‚Äôve never seen anyone
                        eat
                        as many bananas in one sitting as Steve, the team captain. Because of Vi·ªát, they tolerate my
                        complete un-athleticism, acknowledge me with a slight nod and a ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, man.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúC‚Äômon, how long has it been since you washed your uniform?‚Äù Steve asks one of
                        the
                        guys.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His friend, who has a watch tan, shrugs. ‚ÄúI dunno. A week?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát‚Äôs friends are the definition of riveting.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But as different as Vi·ªát is from his teammates, at least from what I can see,
                        it
                        makes sense to see him with them. Vi·ªát‚Äôs always been precise and stuck close to regimens, and I
                        guess that‚Äôs why he and his teammates hang out outside of practice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look around and spot Ali and her Viking braid. She‚Äôs laughing along with some
                        of
                        her friends&mdash;didn‚Äôt think she was capable of that&mdash;but I scan her table and don‚Äôt nd
                        Linh
                        anywhere.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Where‚Äôs Linh now?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Next time I see her, I‚Äôll apologize.</i> I stand up,
                        gathering
                        my things. Vi·ªát asks where I‚Äôm heading. ‚ÄúGotta finish some homework.‚Äù The strawberry yogurt that
                        he
                        set aside conjures the memory of Linh ordering her strawberry-flavored boba tea. And the
                        chocolate
                        milk she slipped into my hand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCan I grab this?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000001.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre1">A caution cone blocks o the guys‚Äô bathroom, where puddles
                        of
                        water glisten on the oor. Old, torn posters and flyers have fallen from their fastenings. Home
                        Economics is having a bake sale. The Vietnamese Student Association is having a carwash
                        fundraiser
                        in a week.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I have to make sure <i class="calibre5">not</i> to be available.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Voices volley o the walls outside the cafeteria, but the hallway itself is
                        silent,
                        absent of rustling clothes and slamming lockers. Where does Linh go during lunch?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then, of course, I know. The art room. Where else would an artist nd refuge?
                        I‚Äôm
                        there in a few minutes, standing just by the threshold, where we nearly collided a few weeks
                        back.
                        She‚Äôs crossing the room to sit on a stool by the window, dressed in paint-splattered overalls
                        that I
                        imagine she‚Äôd changed into.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I clear my throat. Linh turns. ‚ÄúOh, hi. What‚Äôs up? You‚Äôre not eating lunch?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI already did. You?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, I eat pretty quickly. Habit, I guess.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course. We‚Äôre restaurant kids.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Taking this as sign to come in, I hide the yogurt behind my back, walk into the
                        room. ‚ÄúWhat are you working on?‚Äù I‚Äôm close enough to see the canvas now, with just a few strokes
                        of
                        color, a shape yet to be determined.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know. Sometimes I come in, grab some tubes, and start mixing
                        colors
                        just because.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I reach up to touch the canvas, but her hand goes around my wrist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo touching.‚Äù Her voice is threatening, but she‚Äôs suppressing a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hold up a hand in surrender. There‚Äôs a different energy to Linh now. A more
                        protective Linh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I like it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIs this where you always go during lunch? I never see you.‚Äù Of course, I‚Äôm
                        admitting I‚Äôm a stalker&mdash;a shitty one, since I never <i class="calibre5">can</i> nd
                        her&mdash;so that‚Äôs great.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But Linh turns back, dipping her brush into a jar of water, before answering:
                        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
                        nice down here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Unable to nd other things to say, I hand over the yogurt. Her brow furrows in
                        confusion before she glances up. She accepts it, her fingers lingering against my palm. <i
                            class="calibre5">Breathe</i>.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre12">Linh says ‚ÄúHmmm‚Äù before setting it down. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this
                        for?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTo apologize.‚Äù I seize the moment. ‚ÄúOr try to. Look, when we were at the
                        restaurant, I might have asked some questions that you clearly didn‚Äôt want to answer. I didn‚Äôt
                        mean
                        to push you or accuse you. I guess I realized only after that I was being hypocritical too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd you think a yogurt‚Äôs enough to make it up to me?‚Äù She faces the canvas
                        again,
                        her tone monotonous.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh shit, should I run?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúN-no,‚Äù I stutter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs&mdash;well&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her laughter splits the air. She faces me again, and her eyes soften. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs
                        nice
                        of you to say. A part of me knows you‚Äôre right, and I don‚Äôt like it either. Lying is not who I
                        am.
                        But&mdash;‚Äù She shrugs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see another way to do this without lying.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be partners <i class="calibre5">and</i> liars.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pathetic,‚Äù Linh groans, laughing into her hands covering her face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou just realized that?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúI meant what I said, though.‚Äù I pause
                        because,
                        when Linh looks at me suddenly like that, words escape me. So I stare at the</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">oor. ‚ÄúI really wish your parents liked the idea of you as an artist. Your work,
                        it
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">has a way of drawing people in. I‚Äôm the least artistic person on earth, and I
                        just
                        wish you could feel freer to do it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, I guess I‚Äôll just leave you alone now.‚Äù I start backing away, even
                        though my
                        legs don‚Äôt want to move.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, you can stay. I don‚Äôt mind. But only if you‚Äôre quiet.‚Äù She gives me a
                        pointed
                        but playful look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I take the invitation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be over there.‚Äù I wince when the stool I pull out
                        squeaks against the oor. My backpack slams against the table. ‚ÄúI need to start on my article
                        anyway.‚Äù I remember how I shoved my notepad to the bottom of my backpack. I‚Äôll need to dig it
                        out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt started it yet?‚Äù she asks incredulously.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ no.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUse this for inspiration.‚Äù She‚Äôs right next to me now, opening up a
                        see-through
                        folder and sliding a page to me. A sketch, all inked up. I know what this is.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow did you do it so quickly?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI just did.‚Äù She shrugs. Am I cursed to surround myself with casual geniuses?
                        Vi·ªát‚Äôs tolerable, he doesn‚Äôt rub it in my face that school comes easily to him, and here‚Äôs Linh
                        basically saying, but not bragging, <i class="calibre5">I‚Äôm just naturally talented.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, come on.‚Äù I glance down at her sketch of the restaurant. It captures the
                        dimness of the room, the structures hanging down from the ceiling, the columns of Japan‚Äôs
                        cityscapes. It looks print-ready.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBetter get started on your end of the deal,‚Äù she teases me, right by my ear.
                        ‚ÄúOr
                        else you‚Äôll have to answer to Ali.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTeach me how,‚Äù I say, boldness coming from nowhere. I stay as still as
                        possible.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow to what?‚Äù she asks, a hint of amusement in her voice. Disappointing me,
                        she
                        takes a step back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTo get inside my head. Like what happens when you paint.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúClose your eyes, then.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre we going to meditate?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJust do it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A few seconds pass and soon I feel her prying my fingers open, placing
                        something
                        wooden in my palm. I feel it: It‚Äôs long and there‚Äôs rubber at the end; it‚Äôs a&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I open my eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs trying to hold back a laugh, looking down at the pencil in my hand. ‚ÄúI
                        can‚Äôt
                        teach you something like this. You have to do it yourself because writing is personal to you.
                        So‚Äù&mdash;she gestures with her fingers, her tone becoming stern &mdash;‚Äúturn around and just do

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Now</i> I see why you and Ali are friends.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she answers proudly. And she turns to walk back to her easel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And this is how I spend the rest of my lunch, hidden away, just the two of us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The cool metal under me, the hum of the air-conditioning. I listen to Linh
                        washing
                        her brush periodically in water, the brush hitting against glass, sending out a ringing sound,
                        the
                        scratch of brush bristles. And the sway of her ponytail when she tilts her head to examine her
                        work.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-112" class="calibre12">I zone in on her sketch, the colors perfectly capturing
                        the
                        decor. I can even smell salt in the ramen. I close my eyes, tight. The warm broth layers my
                        tongue
                        in flavor. The chewiness of the noodles. Linh‚Äôs laugh as she tried mine.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 18</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The next day, B·∫£o barges into the art room without any announcement, as if he‚Äôd
                        always spent his lunches here and he was running just a bit behind. His hair is windswept and
                        fashionable at the same time, like a breeze purposefully styled his hair. But it‚Äôs his gaze I
                        notice
                        the most. Last year in an art theory lesson, we were taught about the gaze&mdash;or ‚Äúthe Gaze,‚Äù
                        as
                        my art teacher wrote on the board and underlined three times. There are many definitions of a
                        gaze&mdash;it could be the spectator or the patron‚Äôs, or one person in the art piece looking at
                        another person in the same frame, or, more disconcerting, the art looking back at the spectator.
                        It‚Äôs what‚Äôs fascinated critics about <i class="calibre5">Mona Lisa</i> for centuries&mdash;how
                        her
                        outward gaze appears both superior and subdued, defiant and diminutive. That gaze, that look,
                        can
                        carry the whole artwork.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now, I can only describe B·∫£o‚Äôs gaze as shining. Vibrant. Made even more intense
                        since he‚Äôs looking straight at me. He was looking for me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I set down my brush and palette when he o ers a piece of paper to me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my
                        article,‚Äù he says in a rush. I wonder how much caffeine he‚Äôs had. ‚ÄúI worked on it last night.
                        Can you
                        read it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMe?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Hesitantly, I take his paper, which he really did write. His handwriting is
                        solid
                        and straight, nothing like the chicken scratch I‚Äôd seen from other classmates.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou <i class="calibre5">actually</i> hand-wrote this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAt first I was just jotting random things down, and then, I don‚Äôt know, it
                        turned
                        into sentences. Didn‚Äôt even realize how much I was writing.‚Äù He grins. ‚ÄúI think I actually
                        understand what you meant, when we were talking at 7 Leaves. I was outside my body.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre12">‚ÄúAli never lets me read her things,‚Äù I start saying,
                        though
                        I‚Äôm pleased that he remembers what I said. I never have an issue with what Ali writes. I just
                        know
                        she‚Äôs good. Secretly, maybe she‚Äôs always wanted a person to challenge her, nd the mistakes that
                        she
                        can‚Äôt spot herself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o looks so eager that I wouldn‚Äôt want to turn him down anyway. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Ali.
                        This
                        is me. And I want you, specifically, to read this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I say, laughter bubbling in my throat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve never written something like this. So I want you to be the rst
                        one to
                        read my rst article.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSince I‚Äôm not a writer, I‚Äôll probably just say it‚Äôs good. And even if it‚Äôs
                        bad,
                        I‚Äôll probably lie.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll know if you don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow? I <i class="calibre5">can</i> lie.‚Äù I pretend to think. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt we talk
                        about
                        this before?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAll right. Let‚Äôs test it out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Suddenly, from his seat, he hooks his foot around one leg of my stool, pulls me
                        closer so that our knees touch. His eyes are xed on me, and I want to look down, but I force my
                        gaze
                        ahead. I won‚Äôt let him win. His hands loosely hold my wrists.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you like ph·ªü?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I almost burst out in laughter. He‚Äôs being so ridiculous. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that an
                        obvious
                        answer?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm annoying?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAgain, obvious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He glances down. Strands of his hair fall into his eyes as he pauses deep in
                        thought. His knee bumps against mine. ‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm handsome?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">That</i> came out of nowhere. My eyes widen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, I see,‚Äù he says dramatically, beaming widely. ‚ÄúYour face just told me
                        everything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My heart is <i class="calibre5">racing</i>. ‚ÄúThat proved nothing. I wasn‚Äôt
                        expecting that question. And you were only making broad interpretations anyway. My reaction
                        doesn‚Äôt
                        mean that I think&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm handsome, got it,‚Äù he says cheekily. He easily ru
                        es
                        his hair, a direct attack on my nerves right now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I <i class="calibre5">have</i> to look away. I can‚Äôt deal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou want me to read your article or not?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o raises both hands in defense.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shake my head, trying not to smile, before turning my attention to his
                        review.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">As a visual person, I like his opening, his descriptive language painting the
                        scene. I remember the wooden stalactites hanging from the ceiling, the intimidating sensation of
                        gazing up at them, only to be transported to the forests they were emulating. I grin when he
                        describes the sta ‚Äôs hair as ‚Äúperfectly coi ed.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But the food is where I can understand why Ali chose him for this beat. He
                        knows
                        just the right words to describe the ramen and its broth (<i class="calibre5">full-bodied,
                            tinged
                            with enough salt just for the tip of your tongue</i>), the spiciness of my ramen (<i
                            class="calibre5">happy tears, not fiery tears</i>), and by the end I forget that I‚Äôve
                        already
                        eaten lunch. I have a craving for Japanese food again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o‚Äôs staring intently at me when I look back up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell?‚Äù he prompts me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs horrible,‚Äù I say. But he sees my face&mdash;reading it, as he said. And a
                        beautiful smile comes to life.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Ali takes offense when I tell her I let B·∫£o into the room while I was working on
                        an
                        art piece. It‚Äôs something I never let Ali do. For a good reason.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm in the newspaper room, her domain, waiting for the warning bell to signal
                        me to
                        leave. She has her curly hair tied up high in a messy bun on top of her head, a pen buried in
                        there
                        somewhere. Her feet are on the teacher‚Äôs desk, and Rowan, entering the room to disappear into
                        his o
                        ce, points at them, then to the oor. Ali does exactly that‚Ä¶ until his door closes and her feet
                        are
                        back on his desk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou barely tolerate me when I‚Äôm in the room,‚Äù she says with a fake pout.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, because you‚Äôre distracting!‚Äù I shoot back. ‚ÄúYou
                        can‚Äôt
                        sit still <i class="calibre5">and</i> you won‚Äôt stop talking. I need to concentrate.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh and B·∫£o isn‚Äôt distracting.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not, actually,‚Äù I quickly say. Then I remember him ‚Äúreading‚Äù me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs
                        really‚Ä¶ considerate.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to work with B·∫£o in the room, conscious of my
                        every
                        movement, the slouch that I‚Äôve picked up over the years, the mess of my ponytail, how
                        unattractive I
                        must look in my overalls. I felt his gaze on me at times, but when I got the nerve to look
                        around,
                        he was turned away, preoccupied with writing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then I forgot about him. I abandoned thoughts about what image I want to make.
                        Yamamoto likes to tell us that it‚Äôs not always about what we want to put on canvas, that we
                        should
                        let our brushes, pencils, or whatever utensil we use, guide us on unexpected paths. I fool
                        around
                        with colors because most of my memories come up from color. The yogurt that B·∫£o handed to me
                        brings
                        me back to the rst moment I tried strawberry cotton candy at Huntington Beach.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou like him distracting you,‚Äù Ali says mischievously. She brings her feet to
                        the
                        oor, scooting closer, but I avoid her comment, pulling out the sketch that I made for her.
                        Really, I
                        was prolonging my time here. I wanted to see her reaction when B·∫£o handed in his review. I
                        wanted
                        her to say it‚Äôs as good as I thought it was.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Anddd</i> here‚Äôs your sketch&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCome on, Linh! Tell me more&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, perfect, you‚Äôre here too.‚Äù B·∫£o‚Äôs at the threshold, one backpack strap
                        slung
                        over his shoulder. His hair is messy again; he must have been rushing over. I <i
                            class="calibre5">have</i> to stop fixating on his hair. He hands a USB stick to Ali.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere, my article. <i class="calibre5">And</i> it‚Äôs on time.‚Äù We share a look,
                        nearly laughing. I guess he took what I said to heart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHave you ever heard of e-mail?‚Äù Ali mutters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">As Ali turns to her screen, B·∫£o moves closer to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôve imagined many scenarios of how she‚Äôd react if I handed her what I handed
                        you.
                        One: She‚Äôll rip my pages to pieces.‚Äù He pauses. ‚ÄúActually, that‚Äôs the only scenario,‚Äù he admits.
                        He‚Äôs cute when he worries.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali doesn‚Äôt say anything immediately during her review. It goes on for two more
                        minutes. The dripping sound of the sink from its art room days starts irritating me. Anxiety
                        radiates from B·∫£o‚Äôs shifting stance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Ali whirls around, slowly crossing her legs. I envision her as a
                        big-shot
                        editor poised to tear apart some poor journalist‚Äôs article. ‚ÄúLinh drew this?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd you wrote this article.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She folds her hands together and twiddles her thumbs. Slowly, a smile spreads
                        on
                        her face, one I‚Äôve never seen directed at B·∫£o. ‚ÄúThis is good. No, this is <i

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this one line about not spitting at the person across from you when

                    <p class="calibre1">Fast forward to a week later.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o and I didn‚Äôt break new ground with our review and sketch. It‚Äôs not on the
                        front
                        page, either. It‚Äôs not going to change anything, and no one is treating us differently or even
                        acknowledging us as the writer and artist. But I notice that there are fewer stacks of
                        newspapers
                        around the school.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm in the quad packed with students. The temperature‚Äôs nicer today; people are
                        playing Frisbee, couples are lounging on the grass together, and some dancers are trying out new
                        moves, staying inside their exclusive circle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThis! Why can‚Äôt Alex take me to places like this?‚Äù says a girl whose name is
                        Lilly. She‚Äôs on the swim team with her brother Ben.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause he thinks getting boba is an adequate date,‚Äù her friend points out.

                    <p id="calibre_link-118" class="calibre12">Yamamoto was happy to learn I was the artist. Turns out
                        she
                        was planning to use discarded newspaper copies for her paper-mache unit&mdash;which I will
                        definitely
                        never tell Ali&mdash;then unexpectedly caught my name in the byline.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were part of the newspaper, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a favor for a friend,‚Äù I said, a bit embarrassed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI like it! And the writer. Wow, it‚Äôs a great pairing. You‚Äôre full of

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLooks like people are <i class="calibre5">actually</i> reading the newspaper,‚Äù
                        B·∫£o
                        says, now sneaking up behind me. ‚ÄúFor once.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCareful, Ali might be around.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This feeling that I have whenever I‚Äôm around him&mdash;energy zapping through
                        my
                        veins, the warmth in my cheeks, a never-ending want to watch him without being
                        obvious&mdash;doesn‚Äôt
                        seem to be going away. At the restaurant, I‚Äôm glancing more often at the window&mdash;not to
                        watch
                        him, like Ba, but just to steal another look at him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Hidden away in the art room, we‚Äôre not as jittery. It‚Äôs our sanctuary. We‚Äôve
                        fallen
                        into an unspoken pattern, me painting while B·∫£o works on an assignment for the newspaper or some
                        other homework.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali‚Äôs right. This is becoming something more, but like many things in my life,
                        it
                        can‚Äôt all happen at once. These feelings, this crush, whatever you call it, they‚Äôre something to
                        keep to myself. To contain before it gets reckless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We nd Ali eating her own lunch, a neatly cut egg salad sandwich. There‚Äôs a
                        stack of
                        newspapers next to her. Leave it to her to pass around newspapers during her break.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLook!‚Äù she squeals.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs great. Just what you hoped for, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI <i class="calibre5">knew</i> the front-page article would be a hit.‚Äù From
                        what I
                        recall, the front page is about the school‚Äôs lack of cybersecurity, authored by my indomitably
                        spirited best friend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o gives me a look before throwing his bag onto the ground. We won‚Äôt ruin her
                        joy.
                        He stretches onto his back and lies there for a moment, the sun shining strong down on him,
                        highlighting the lines of his face again. What <i class="calibre5">is</i> it with his face and
                        light? It‚Äôs just too perfect. I sit on my hands to stop myself from sketching him‚Ä¶ again.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre12">Another part of me itches to join him, lie right next to
                        him
                        and take in the sun. I settle for sitting, stretching out my legs so that my shoes are just by
                        his
                        ear. Just one touch away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o‚Äôs best friend, Vi·ªát, nds us a few moments later, and introduces himself to
                        me
                        and Ali. Ali‚Äôs already trying to recruit him to be a reviewer after hearing that he‚Äôs obsessed
                        with
                        dark, gritty television shows.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThink about it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf you start now, you can be the next Roger
                        Ebert.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really a writer. I can‚Äôt write like B·∫£o,‚Äù Vi·ªát answers simply.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o, now sitting, looks genuinely shocked to hear the comment, but Vi·ªát doesn‚Äôt
                        seem to notice. ‚ÄúThanks, man.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúKnew all those words you collect would pay o someday.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I can tell from Ali‚Äôs expression that she‚Äôs not done trying to recruit Vi·ªát.
                        She
                        means well; she just wants to leave a mark when she graduates, but some people don‚Äôt see that as
                        easily and might stay clear of her. A wave of sympathy washes over me until I remember what B·∫£o
                        said
                        about Vi·ªát. He‚Äôs cool and collected and seems to do his own thing. Maybe he‚Äôll be the rst one to
                        really handle Ali‚Äôs assertiveness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The four of us are a little weird together, but somehow‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt ask for a
                        better
                        group to eat lunch with today.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, great!‚Äù Ali‚Äôs staring at her phone. ‚ÄúWe already have our next restaurant.
                        Are
                        you two ready?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Instantly, I look to B·∫£o, and I know his answer, because it‚Äôs mine, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúReady.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Days later, I get home and see another set of shoes by the door. A guest? It‚Äôs a
                        weird time, and usually if people come over, they come over at night. I sni the air, picking up
                        a
                        familiar scent: oil, so food‚Äôs being fried, and as I follow the scent, it clicks: M·∫π‚Äôs making
                        egg
                        rolls. As I walk closer, I recognize the guest‚Äôs voice.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-120" class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π, I don‚Äôt <i class="calibre5">need</i> another set of
                        dishes. Where can I put them? I don‚Äôt even have a kitchen.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou have a communal kitchen, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù my mom asks in Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, but other people in my dorm are shitty and they‚Äôll probably steal all my
                        things.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π and Evie, wearing a UC Davis hoodie, sit at the round table, spooning meat
                        into
                        defrosted egg roll wrappers while my dad carefully peels each of them away. Seeing me, he
                        beckons
                        me, probably wanting me to take his place, but I ignore him for now&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúEvie!‚Äù I squeal, going in for a hug.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My big sister laughs as we nearly fall over. She hugs me without her hands
                        touching
                        me. ‚ÄúPlease rescue me. M·∫π‚Äôs forcing me to take <i class="calibre5">all</i> of this back with
                        me.‚Äù
                        She points to the kitchen counter filled with Costco-size food and pots and pans. Probably from
                        the
                        basement, where she keeps so many on-sale things, saying that one day we‚Äôll need them. The
                        Bounty
                        rolls I can understand, but four types of wooden chopping boards?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were coming home.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only so many text messages from M·∫π that my phone can hold. <i

                        mimic
                        our mom.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">M·∫π nh·ªõ con</i>,‚Äù our mom says defensively.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, I know you miss me, but can you miss me less?‚Äù my sister says, jokingly
                        rolling her eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou should have told me, or else I wouldn‚Äôt have stayed so long at school,‚Äù I
                        say,
                        taking a seat.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh is always staying late,‚Äù Ba chimes in. ‚ÄúToo many times, I think, for her
                        art
                        classes. You have to think about school, not art. Good grades will get you into school, not
                        art.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I lean back into my chair, stomach dropping. Not again. Across the table, Evie
                        gives me a sympathetic look. It hits me then how much I miss her. She‚Äôs usually the one saying,
                        ‚ÄúArt
                        isn‚Äôt always painting and drawing. It has a lot to do with creative thinking and not a lot of
                        people
                        can think that way, think like Linh.‚Äù She always had a way of explaining things to make them
                        sound
                        so much easier, sound like it could work in an ideal world.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-121" class="calibre12">Like now: ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs cool that Linh does this. And she‚Äôs
                        good. And there‚Äôs <i class="calibre5">tons</i> of people who do art in college.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, but have you met one with a job?‚Äù M·∫π asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, but that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt hang out with&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSee!‚Äù Ba interrupts her. ‚ÄúSee, artists don‚Äôt get jobs.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou <i class="calibre5">can</i> get a job,‚Äù I finally say, my voice loud. ‚ÄúIt
                        might
                        take a while, but it‚Äôs not impossible.‚Äù My parents glance at me at the same time. Something
                        behind
                        my dad‚Äôs eyes makes me bite my tongue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúArt is fun,‚Äù he says shortly. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs just it: It can only be fun. It can
                        never support you. Con, M·∫π and Ba have worked so hard so that you can have a better life.‚Äù My
                        sister
                        and I exchange suffering looks, knowing where our parents are going. Ba catches the exchange and
                        merely tsks, though it might be because the layer he‚Äôs trying to peel isn‚Äôt complying. ‚ÄúEvelyn
                        is on
                        the right track, so we don‚Äôt have to worry as much about her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe texts from M·∫π about my eating habits prove otherwise,‚Äù Evie mutters.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs your turn,‚Äù Ba finishes. He gestures for me to start filling the
                        wrappers.
                        The key is to put a modest spoonful of meat inside, then roll up tight enough and seal it with
                        egg
                        wash so that it doesn‚Äôt uncurl when the roll hits oil, which happens too many times to mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFirst batch is out!‚Äù M·∫π emerges, shows us a batch of crispy, golden egg rolls
                        in a
                        sieve, layered with a paper towel to catch excess oil. ‚ÄúTry one.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My sister bites into one, then beams at M·∫π. ‚ÄúJust what I needed.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We fall into a familiar pattern as we work together. Evie regales us with tales
                        of
                        college so far. I try not to laugh whenever her recollection gets interrupted by M·∫π and Ba as
                        they
                        ask about her friends, about their nationality, if they‚Äôre <i class="calibre5">m·∫≠p hay ·ªëm</i>,
                        where
                        they live, what their parents are like. But my sister answers each question patiently, already
                        anticipating their questions. I make a note to do background checks when I get to college.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I stay quiet, still stung by my parents‚Äô tone when they said I could never make
                        a
                        living from my art. They don‚Äôt get it.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-122" class="calibre4"><img src="images/000005.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" />
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">That feeling of missing having my sister around? Disappears in not even two
                        hours,
                        especially since Evie‚Äôs back to sharing a room with me for the weekend. She‚Äôs already dismayed
                        by
                        how messy I‚Äôve made it. ‚ÄúIf I nd one thing missing, I‚Äôll kill you,‚Äù she says casually as she
                        searches her drawer for something. I actually think she‚Äôs taking inventory until she pulls out
                        Q-tips. She just emerged from the shower and has her long hair wrapped up in a towel turban.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Evie bends over to examine a sketch of mine. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs great. Did you just
                        draw
                        it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYep.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how you can do things like this. See something, then put it
                        on
                        paper. I can barely do stick drawings.‚Äù She‚Äôs only teasing me; she‚Äôs remembering the kitchen
                        table
                        conversation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTell that to M·∫π and Ba.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She sits down on the edge of my bed. ‚ÄúThey told me about your interview with
                        that
                        engineer. I almost didn‚Äôt believe it. How‚Äôd it go?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHorrible.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFigured. Engineering‚Äôs not for you.‚Äù She says it like an undisputed fact,
                        though I
                        wish it were my parents stating that. ‚ÄúI have tons of friends majoring in engineering. They‚Äôre
                        logical, <i class="calibre5">organized</i>&mdash;‚Äù I throw my pillow at her, which Evie deftly
                        catches with a grin. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not finished! What I mean to add is a ‚Äòbut.‚Äô They can‚Äôt look at a
                        painting and see what you see. And they can‚Äôt create things like you do. Not instinctively like
                        you
                        do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now I want to take back my pillow. She‚Äôs being nice. She‚Äôs always nice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI think about telling them. But I have this feeling that it won‚Äôt go well.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In a better reality, Evie would dispute that fact, would tell me to ‚Äúgo for
                        it.‚Äù
                        But Evie is Evie. She grew up with me. She knows our parents. She knows what they‚Äôve said about
                        having art as a career. So thoughtful silence is the expected response.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI lied about it going well,‚Äù I admit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFigured. You know how your face gives you away.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre, like, the fourth person to say that about me!‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-123" class="calibre12">She lifts her chin, appearing haughty. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your sister,
                        so I
                        know. I always knew whenever you stole one of my shirts.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I roll my eyes. ‚ÄúThat only happened twice.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She points at me. ‚ÄúLie.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shrug. I might have stolen from her a couple more times, but at least she‚Äôs
                        older
                        and she won‚Äôt enact revenge against&mdash;‚ÄúOof!‚Äù The pillow slams in my face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúEvie!‚Äù I protest loudly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">From their bedroom, where Ba was probably trying to fall asleep, he yells for
                        us to
                        quiet down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We laugh mutedly and fall back into bed. Evie cuddles closer to me, while I
                        pretend
                        to kick her away, telling her to go back to her bed. But we only have a day or two together, and
                        then she‚Äôll be back at UC Davis, miles away, living a completely different life from me. I don‚Äôt
                        mean
                        it. I want her close by.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In one perfect move, Evie launches the pillow at the light switch, and we fall
                        under darkness. We lie in silence. I‚Äôm counting each time the ceiling fan makes a complete turn,
                        signaled by a nearly indescribable screech.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUC Davis is good?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than I could have ever imagined, Linh. The campus is beautiful.
                        And
                        the science lab&mdash;‚Äù She sighs. It sounds like she fell in love with her lab instead of,
                        like, a
                        person.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I envy her. She‚Äôs where she wanted to be. Where she always dreamed of going.
                        Plus,
                        while she and my parents have disagreed on things&mdash;curfew and sleeping over at a friend‚Äôs
                        house&mdash;they‚Äôve never argued about Evie‚Äôs future. They never had an issue with it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI wish I could like what you like,‚Äù I whisper in the dark.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Evie‚Äôs foot touches mine; it‚Äôs cold and I kick her. I can feel her smile in the
                        dark. ‚ÄúIf you liked what I liked, you wouldn‚Äôt be Linh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLife would be so much easier if I liked what you liked, though.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúEasier?‚Äù I imagine her lifting herself into a sitting position. ‚ÄúHow would
                        that
                        have made it easier?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something safe. It‚Äôs something our parents approve of.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSafe. Huh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre12">I sense Evie‚Äôs mood shifting, then I replay what I just
                        said.
                        ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean that in a bad way, Evie. It‚Äôs just, you‚Äôre doing something that M·∫π and Ba approve
                        of.
                        Meanwhile, I want to be an artist. Definitely what they wouldn‚Äôt want me to do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She doesn‚Äôt answer right away and it‚Äôs making me uneasy. I have half a mind to
                        get
                        up from bed and turn on the lights, just so that I can see her expression.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then she sighs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy, Linh. It‚Äôs never been easy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She‚Äôs speaking not at me, but to me. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd ever taken an art class in high
                        school, I‚Äôd get an earful. Whenever I asked them to hang out with a friend after school, they‚Äôd
                        say
                        no, there were too many things I needed to do. I had to wear them down. But for you, it‚Äôs
                        different.
                        They treat you differently. They allow you to do more things.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd there are some moments where I think about how I decided on biology. Am I
                        doing this because Ba and M·∫π pushed me toward it? Or did I always like biology? Where does the
                        line
                        between what I want and what our parents want end?‚Äù I had to think, too. I‚Äôm not so sure. ‚ÄúSee,
                        I
                        don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs different for you, though. Two years makes a whole lot of difference.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I say in the dark. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ well, I guess I didn‚Äôt notice.‚Äù But
                        I
                        was only younger by two years, and I lived in the same house, so how could I have missed this?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Evie eases back into bed. She throws her leg over mine. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs generally
                        accepted
                        that in families like ours, the older kids have it way harder. We‚Äôre the guinea pigs in a
                        real-world
                        lab.‚Äù Her tone shifts to something more playful. ‚ÄúWhat did Hasan Minhaj say one time? Older
                        siblings
                        ‚Äògo to war‚Äô for their younger siblings? Because that‚Äôs what it was like. That‚Äôs what I did. So
                        that
                        really means, you owe me everything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shove her lightly by the shoulder. ‚ÄúFor what it‚Äôs worth, I think you‚Äôre made
                        for
                        biology. I don‚Äôt remember you ever liking anything else.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat could be.‚Äù Evie sighs, and yawns.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 19</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Slowly, I‚Äôm getting used to being on the newspaper, being a part of a team.
                        After
                        the success of my rst review, Ali‚Äôs not so on top of me anymore. In her eyes, I‚Äôve stepped up;
                        she‚Äôs
                        still delegating proofreading tasks to me, but she‚Äôs giving me multiple articles&mdash;more than
                        anyone else on the editing team.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My classmates are coming by to talk about their edits, having revised what they
                        wrote and asking me to look them over. One side of me wonders if they ask me because Ali can be
                        a
                        little intense&mdash;‚Äúpassionate‚Äù was Linh‚Äôs word&mdash;but I like to think that they truly want
                        my
                        help. Even if my classmates are using me to avoid Ali, it feels good to be approached like this.
                        To
                        have them trust me with their work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Each writer looks at language so differently. Ali focuses on the message in
                        writing&mdash;is the point getting across? Where can the writer be clearer in their intention?
                        Me, I
                        like the writer‚Äôs style. One person can say something that‚Äôs been said before but in a way
                        that‚Äôs
                        completely different; their unique experiences and personality infuse their words, their
                        sentences.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm working with Ernie‚Äôs article summarizing the National Honor Society‚Äôs
                        induction
                        of new members. Ernie shrinks under attention in person, so whether he knows it or not, he uses
                        a
                        lot of passive voice in his writing. Things are done to the subject; the subject isn‚Äôt taking
                        action. The budget cut to the arts was cut <i class="calibre5">by</i> the budget
                        committee&mdash;not
                        the budget committee cut the budget for the arts program. Compared to Ali‚Äôs writing, which gets
                        straight to the point, Ernie lacks confidence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get into astronomy; that‚Äôs the only reason why I‚Äôm here,‚Äù he says
                        glumly, reading my edits.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to take this class either,‚Äù I say, trying
                        to
                        cheer him up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, but you‚Äôre good at it. And Ali doesn‚Äôt go after you.‚Äù As if she were
                        right
                        behind us, Ernie glances over his shoulder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali‚Äôs sandwiched between two designers huddling around her. They‚Äôre going over
                        proofs for the next issue. I might not understand their process, though I don‚Äôt have to. It‚Äôs
                        hers,
                        it‚Äôs theirs, something only they can understand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ernie‚Äôs eyebrows scrunch together like he‚Äôs reading a di erent language. I know
                        where he‚Äôs coming from.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJournalism might not be for everyone, but you‚Äôre not bad at all. Maybe you
                        just
                        need to nd something you like writing about,‚Äù I finally say, channeling Linh. ‚ÄúWhat are you
                        interested
                        in?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI dunno. I like skateboarding. Reading comics.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI guess I watch a lot of Netflix. TV stuff.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I remember Ali trying to recruit Vi·ªát as a writer. This might be perfect.
                        ‚ÄúWould
                        you want to write about a show? You can ask Ali if you can do it. She‚Äôs looking for a reviewer.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù he asks hesitantly. ‚ÄúDo you think she‚Äôll let me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Looks like I‚Äôm not the only person who‚Äôs intimidated by her. I laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll
                        talk to
                        her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Later, as the dismissal bell rings and students y out of the classroom, I stop
                        by
                        Ali as she‚Äôs scrolling through her phone, answering texts. ‚ÄúOh, hey, B·∫£o. Did you work through
                        Ernie‚Äôs article? Thought it needed to be tightened but otherwise it‚Äôs good to print.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, everything worked out. I heard Ernie‚Äôs into TV shows. Watches a lot of
                        Net
                        ix. Maybe he should try the entertainment section.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúReally? He never told me that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt know we had an open spot.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali nods, calculating something in her head. ‚ÄúSure. Why not?‚Äù The alarm clock
                        on
                        her phone goes o . ‚ÄúShit, I‚Äôm gonna be late.‚Äù</p>

                        simply. I pretend not to look so shocked but, rst she doesn‚Äôt use study hall in favor of heading
                        the
                        newspaper here. And now I learned that she also works part-time. She must really love the

                    <p class="calibre1">Imagine my surprise when one of Vi·ªát‚Äôs friends sits down in front of me at
                        lunch.
                        It‚Äôs miserable and raining outside so most people are in the cafeteria. Vi·ªát hasn‚Äôt even sat
                        yet,
                        but Steve, the banana-eating captain, takes a seat across from me. He‚Äôs grown out his brown
                        hair,
                        tied it into a little ponytail&mdash;to be ironic? In all our time together, we haven‚Äôt really
                        held
                        a conversation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey, you busy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, no.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI wanted to see if you can do something for me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre asking <i class="calibre5">me</i>?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, Vi·ªát said you‚Äôre on the newspaper or something. Said you edit shit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, yeah, I edit shit.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He digs into his backpack that almost looks Army-issued. Removes his brown-bag
                        lunch. Used tissues. A paperback and dog-eared Carnegie‚Äôs <i class="calibre5">How to Win Friends
                            and

                    <p class="calibre12">My eyebrows go up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Steve clears his throat. ‚ÄúMy mom wanted me to read it,‚Äù he mumbles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Fascinating. ‚ÄúRight. Uh, you needed my help on what, exactly?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Finally, he yanks out a crumpled, lined piece of paper with his chicken scratch
                        all
                        over it. He smooths it out against the table‚Äôs edge, like you would with dollar bills at a
                        vending
                        machine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on my personal statement for some college applications, and I have an
                        essay,
                        but I can‚Äôt really make the rst paragraph stick. My sisters read it and liked the essay in
                        general,
                        but they say the introduction makes me sound like a fth grader.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOuch.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know.‚Äù He grimaces. ‚ÄúBut I think they‚Äôre right. I know we always have to
                        open
                        something with a strong statement, but I can‚Äôt come up with anything. Can you help?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre12">If Ali were in my seat, she‚Äôd have a few more words to
                        say to
                        Steve, probably things worse than his own sisters. But me, I try to be more sympathetic.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I feel for my red pen in my backpack and blow out some air. ‚ÄúOkay, what are you
                        trying to say here, exactly?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His essay is about his love of running. How it‚Äôs not just a physical thing, but
                        a
                        mental thing for him. When he‚Äôs stressed out or upset about something, he puts on his shoes and
                        just
                        runs, no destination in mind. As I switch between listening to him talk and reading his words,
                        I‚Äôm
                        starting to understand what his sisters said about the introduction. It doesn‚Äôt even sound like
                        him.
                        It sounds mechanical, forced.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúStart with a feeling,‚Äù I tell Steve finally, circling his paragraph. ‚ÄúI like
                        what
                        you said about letting your mind take you on a trip and how you like being surprised by where
                        the
                        run‚Äôs taking you.‚Äù Kind of like how Linh talks about painting. ‚ÄúSo why not open with that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, but shouldn‚Äôt I write some sort of thesis statement, too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIn a way, yeah. But to call it a thesis statement makes it sound like a school
                        paper. You‚Äôre writing a personal statement, a personal essay, about something personal to you:
                        running.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Steve nods, looking down at his pages.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I add, ‚ÄúSo be honest and open with that. Make the readers feel what you feel
                        when
                        you run.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Steve doesn‚Äôt say anything immediately. I re-cap my pen just so that I can have
                        something to do. Maybe I‚Äôm not even helping. Maybe I‚Äôve made him more confused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát finally arrives, saying something about waiting for more Sloppy Joes. By
                        then,
                        Steve‚Äôs nodding to himself, reading my edits. When he looks up, he‚Äôs a bit more reenergized.
                        ‚ÄúThanks, man.‚Äù He st-bumps me before sneaking away to the library to type up his new
                        introduction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo, did you help him?‚Äù Vi·ªát asks through a mouthful of ground beef.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI think so. Why‚Äôd you tell him I was good at editing?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He shrugs. ‚ÄúBecause you are.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow would you know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-129" class="calibre12">‚ÄúAli.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been talking to Ali?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, she‚Äôs cool. She keeps trying to recruit me for the entertainment
                        section,
                        and I keep telling her no.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát: My best friend with nerves of steel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell, I think we might have someone for that section now and I just told her.
                        Maybe she‚Äôll leave you alone.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all good. She doesn‚Äôt really bother me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A sense of unease settles inside me. They‚Äôre talking to each other, which means
                        they must <i class="calibre5">like</i> being around each other, which means‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhat else do you
                        talk
                        about?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The saying ‚ÄúWaiting for the other shoe to drop‚Äù has never felt more pertinent
                        as I
                        lean forward, expecting Vi·ªát‚Äôs admission of feelings for Linh‚Äôs best friend.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe talk about when you and Linh are getting together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That shoe, from who knows where, never falls.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát grins. ‚ÄúYup. Ali‚Äôs saying after the fourth review. I‚Äôm saying way before
                        that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Why</i> are you even making bets?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI am, which is why I‚Äôm telling you now that this all needs to happen after the

                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát‚Äôs more invested than I thought he‚Äôd be and&mdash;Ali.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh God. Has she said anything to Linh?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Before I can even ask these important questions, a plethora of bright colors
                        blocks
                        my eld of vision. I look up to see pin-straight bangs against a prominent forehead.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát quickly excuses himself from the table.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre12">He also skipped along with me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôve been meaning to nd you. I‚Äôm feeling like you‚Äôre not taking your

                        anymore.‚Äù There‚Äôs a threat to her voice, but it‚Äôs entirely ineffective since I wasn‚Äôt even aware
                        I
                        was still a member.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, hey, Linh. Great, you finally came. I know we have to go to that thing.‚Äù

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThing?‚Äù Linh asks, an eyebrow quirked. Then with a familiar smile, she says,

                    <p class="calibre12">Kelly‚Äôs looking between us, probably wondering how we even know each other.

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll be there, too,‚Äù I say grudgingly.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI like her. We had some classes together and she was always nice. And this

                        me as she rides along. That would meet two of her goals for the weekend: (1) force her son to do
                        something and (2) get some grocery shopping done. M·∫π doesn‚Äôt go to Thu·∫≠n Ph√°t too often, maybe

                        the rst open spot. Mothers marching like they‚Äôre on a mission, their kids dragging their feet.

                        made with enough glitter to stop tra c. Kelly‚Äôs doing, most likely. Linh sits at the table,
                        glancing
                        around. She‚Äôs dressed in a simple white tee and jeans, sunglasses on top. I slide into the empty

                    <p class="calibre12">Together we watch Kelly, who has stopped a disheveled-looking man who must have
                        been forced to do a last-minute grocery run by his wife. He attempts to escape, to no avail.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMore like she‚Äôs doing it herself. Which I think is why not a lot of people
                        want to

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCan I tell you a secret?‚Äù I lean in, beckoning her, and she follows with a

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFirst it‚Äôs Ali who hates you. Then it‚Äôs Kelly. Now what did you do to her?‚Äù

                    <p class="calibre12">A couple of shoppers have come by, inquiring about our table, and Linh greets
                        them
                        automatically, putting on a smile like she did this all the time. Her energy is palpable and
                        contagious.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo one in particular,‚Äù I answer her question, more to

                    <p class="calibre12">Meanwhile, Kelly passes down another pile of flyers to replenish our stack. She
                        sips
                        a boba from Boba Corner 2. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the ball cap?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBad haircut.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Time passes slowly, but it‚Äôs not so bad with Linh next to me. We pass

                        I spot faint paint marks on the back of her hand, which weren‚Äôt there yesterday. She must have t

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWere you painting?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, yeah,‚Äù she says, sheepish again. ‚ÄúTrying to, at least. I need to submit
                        something to the Gold Key competition. I‚Äôm realizing that the deadline is getting closer and

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on a few things about memory. Good memories. The kind that last a

                        It was a tough year, that rst year. People were hard on them.‚Äù Linh looks over at me and I know
                        what
                        she‚Äôs thinking. My mom. The General and the others, the snide remarks they made at the

                        and also freely in public&mdash;</p>

                        because
                        they were always working. But that night, we finished and it‚Äôd gone well, and I remember seeing
                        my
                        parents standing by the front windows, just chatting, saying goodbye to some customers. A
                        totally
                        normal scene.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm there with her, can feel the window‚Äôs smooth glass against my hand and its
                        warmth after facing the sun for the whole day. Linh‚Äôs tone changes into something like reverence
                        and
                        she lifts her hand, gesturing as if she were smearing paint all over a canvas. ‚ÄúBut the sky
                        behind
                        them was swathes of blush red and purple and yellow. It took my breath away. It was really
                        beautiful. So I‚Äôm working on a small canvas for that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat sounds nice.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, it was.‚Äù She looks over at me. ‚ÄúHow about you? Still okay with
                        mediocrity?‚Äù
                        she says teasingly, leaning forward. A piece of her hair has caught itself on the neck of her
                        T-shirt and I feel like I want to move it away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve advanced a little.‚Äù I copy Linh, moving closer even though there‚Äôs
                        no
                        reason to. ‚ÄúSomeone asked for my help the other day. One of Vi·ªát‚Äôs friends needed help. So I

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDid it go well?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah. It doesn‚Äôt happen often&mdash;someone asking me for help. Especially
                        with

                        front of me. Beaming. I have to blink a few times to remember where I am.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The two of us dash into one of the aisles&mdash;the one with all the dried
                        fruits,
                        seeds, and peanuts. An older woman catches sight of us and narrows her eyes, before wheeling her
                        cart and turning right at the end.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOut of all the days,‚Äù B·∫£o moans. His phone vibrates in his hand. His mom.
                        ‚ÄúShould
                        I answer?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, pick up. You don‚Äôt want her to be suspicious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHi, M·∫π,‚Äù he answers, forcing cheeriness into his voice. ‚ÄúYeah, that was me. I
                        was
                        just taking a break.‚Äù Pause. ‚ÄúWhere did I go? I‚Äôm in the‚Ä¶ snacks aisle. You‚Äôre
                        heading&mdash;where?
                        The peanuts aisle?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">An alarm goes o inside me. I make a split-second decision and dash into the
                        aisle
                        to the left, where sriracha and other Asian sauces are stocked. The lady from before hu s in
                        annoyance when I nearly ram in her. She mutters under her breath about teenagers these days
                        being <i class="calibre5">m√¢·∫•t d·∫°y</i>, yet continues shopping.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then I hear B·∫£o‚Äôs mom. Her voice is loud as she addresses B·∫£o, jolting me. I
                        don‚Äôt
                        think I‚Äôve heard it since that day at the temple. I duck, catching a glimpse of her through the
                        shelves low on stock. ‚ÄúB·∫£o?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYep,‚Äù he answers hoarsely before clearing his throat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π almost forgot con wore that hat today. Look <i class="calibre5">k·ª≥</i>. M·∫π
                        thought con want snacks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-137" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell, I thought I‚Äôd just meet you here.‚Äù He glances at
                        me
                        swiftly, then uses his back to block me&mdash;and my line of vision. ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt nd anything
                        at
                        Saigon City?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, there was nothing much on sale. But there‚Äôs plenty of things on sale
                        here.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, sorry, I guess I read an old yer.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo con want a snack?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His reply is quick. ‚ÄúOh, no I think I‚Äôm&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúCon?‚Äù</i> I pivot sharply. M·∫π. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù Meanwhile, I try to listen to the conversation on
                        the
                        other side, to see if they‚Äôre moving. B·∫£o and his mom are walking to the back. Too close. Our
                        mothers can‚Äôt see each other&mdash;who knows what will happen! So I steer my mother the opposite
                        way, into the nuts aisle, moving us like a revolving door would. ‚ÄúBut never mind, I figured I
                        would
                        just wait for lunch to eat.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π can buy you something if you need it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, no, I think I‚Äôll be ne for now&mdash;let‚Äôs just&mdash;‚Äù Unfathomably,
                        B·∫£o‚Äôs
                        mom is walking past our aisle, him trailing behind, probably thinking we‚Äôd have moved by then.
                        He
                        freezes, then runs ahead, grabbing a random snack. I hear him ask if he could get this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Thankful for the distraction, I loop my arm through my mom‚Äôs. ‚ÄúActually, can I
                        get
                        an egg tart?‚Äù That, on any other occasion, would have been a normal request. It was always a
                        reward
                        for me and Evie for behaving while our mother completed her shopping.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π smiles slightly, the corners of her eyes wrinkling. ‚ÄúSome things never
                        change.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Even though we‚Äôre a good distance away from B·∫£o and his mom, I keep an eye out
                        for
                        them as M·∫π points at the pastries&mdash;the guy at the counter only speaks Malaysian. My mom
                        ends up
                        buying enough for the volunteers, and when she</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">finishes checking out her groceries&mdash;watching the prices climb
                        closely&mdash;she
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">waves good-bye at me and leaves none the wiser.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I run into B·∫£o around the corner of the exit. He stops me from going further,
                        grabbing my wrist, and I hear his mom complaining to him about the nal receipt before telling
                        him
                        she‚Äôll see him back at home. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat too much,‚Äù she says, though she‚Äôs shoving another bag of
                        snacks his way. The other volunteers are going to love us.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-138" class="calibre12">Then B·∫£o‚Äôs mom is gone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And we‚Äôre both alive.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Returning to the entrance, B·∫£o and I plop down at the volunteering table,
                        exhausted. Kelly asks why we just disappeared, but we hold up the box of pastries as an excuse.
                        The
                        volunteers eagerly dig in, and B·∫£o gladly reaches for an egg tart.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSee?‚Äù he says in between bites. ‚ÄúThis is why I don‚Äôt volunteer.‚Äù A triumphant
                        grin
                        starts forming until he looks down at our knotted hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt pull away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He doesn‚Äôt pull away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm staring at our hands together, trying to pretend that they aren‚Äôt ours,
                        just
                        like I did to B·∫£o‚Äôs hand before. I was studying his fingers objectively, sketching them as
                        nothing
                        more than a prop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But I can‚Äôt do that now. Because it <i class="calibre5">is</i> our hands, and
                        neither of us is letting go. My heart pounds. Adrenaline from before or now? I‚Äôm not sure. His
                        thumb
                        caresses my knuckles in a move that seems natural, like he‚Äôd always held my hand like this. I
                        inhale
                        sharply. In different circumstances, this could happen. This is possible in an alternate
                        reality.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My other hand, I realize, is resting on the table, exactly on top of the sketch
                        of
                        his hand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We don‚Äôt say anything, and we don‚Äôt move until someone down the table asks me
                        to
                        hand them extra flyers, so I have to let go, and I do it like I‚Äôve been scorched. <i
                            class="calibre5">Don‚Äôt look at him</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The rest of volunteering for us is spent in silence, and I‚Äôm lost in how to
                        handle
                        this impossible, unsaid thing sitting between us.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 21</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I‚Äôve been thinking about Linh‚Äôs hand a lot, her paint-marked hand fitting into
                        my
                        palm. I remember it like it was a living heart, pulsing. I‚Äôve replayed that moment we noticed
                        what
                        was happening and decided not to care, the moment that I knew we‚Äôd stepped into a new place
                        without
                        planning to. I wish there was a word stronger than ‚Äúpalpable,‚Äù but I guess that was sufficient
                        for
                        now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When she let go, I wanted so badly to snatch her hand back. When she muttered a
                        quick goodbye to me, I wanted to tell her not to leave. We couldn‚Äôt just ignore what happened.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She didn‚Äôt pull away. She could have, but she didn‚Äôt. Does that mean she feels
                        the
                        same way as me?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát and Ali had seen it before us, apparently.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The next week, to my disappointment, unfolds like the days before our worlds
                        collided on Ph·ªü Day. Our schedule consists of way too many misses. At lunch, when I stop by the
                        art
                        room, I don‚Äôt nd her there. I know for a fact that Linh‚Äôs avoiding me, because she skipped the
                        next
                        restaurant coverage, mentioning it to Ali, who told me she was overwhelmed by work and painting.
                        There‚Äôs truth in that, I‚Äôm sure, but not completely.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She‚Äôs scared, and I wish I could tell her that I am, too. That I don‚Äôt know how
                        things will work. But if we could hold hands a bit longer, maybe we‚Äôll figure it out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I had to go alone to a Malaysian restaurant, while most of the customers
                        enjoyed
                        meals among large families. They must have felt sorry for me, a high school boy, dining out
                        alone.
                        The chef gave me a doggy bag of some kind of cookies that Ba demolished later in the night.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre12">As we sit across the table at 10:00 p.m., feeling M·∫π‚Äôs
                        absence as she was still at a friend‚Äôs house for a mani and pedi, I have this ridiculous thought
                        to
                        ask for advice. <i class="calibre5">Ba is a man. Ba has experienced things like this‚Ä¶ right?</i>
                        Then I stop the idea almost immediately. I must be getting desperate if I think it‚Äôs a good pick
                        to
                        ask my dad, stone-cold Dad, for girl advice when we don‚Äôt exactly enjoy small talk in general.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Tonight must be different, because Ba starts the small talk anyway. Those
                        cookies
                        must be good.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need your help in the next few weeks at the restaurant.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, okay. What‚Äôs happening?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour mom and I are planning a <i class="calibre5">B√°nh X√®o</i> Day to
                        introduce different kinds of <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> to the menu. So things will be
                        busy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Just like Vi·ªát had suggested.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDid Vi·ªát mention anything to you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy would he?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù I think about the special. Linh‚Äôs family&mdash;Linh&mdash;are
                        going
                        to see it as a direct response to their Ph·ªü Day. Great: One more reason for our parents to
                        despise
                        one another.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy now?‚Äù I ask warily.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTo make sure our customers don‚Äôt get tired of our menus.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWill it work? We don‚Äôt usually do different kinds of <i class="calibre5">b√°nh
                            x√®o</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe never really know when things will work. We weren‚Äôt sure a restaurant would
                        work, but here we are. There is no use playing it safe when it comes to our restaurant.‚Äù Ba gets
                        up
                        and puts on the teakettle. He shu es to the cabinet where we keep various tins of tea leaves. <i
                            class="calibre5">‚ÄúMu·ªën tr√† kh√¥ng?‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shake my head, thinking tea will only keep me up later than I should.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Playing it safe.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">If my dad‚Äôs willing to do something that might not bring him any sure result,
                        maybe
                        I can do the same.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000008.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-141" class="calibre1">Later I stared for longer than I‚Äôd like to admit at a text
                        to
                        send to Linh. A text asking her to meet again, face-to-face. I wasn‚Äôt as blunt; I had a good
                        reason
                        to text her, since Ali sent me another restaurant to visit. So I mentioned that to her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then her bubbles begin to appear, so I shut down the Messages app, until a ring
                        tells me to read it.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 22</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I‚Äôve been thinking about B·∫£o‚Äôs hand a lot, his thumb unthinkingly brushing the
                        top
                        of mine. A moment brimming with potential, but neither of us could say a word about it. Because
                        we
                        know. We both know the risks that we were taking, just sitting next to each other. We barely
                        escaped
                        our mothers back then.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat do you think, con?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs after dinner; the dishes have been cleared and a pot of freshly brewed
                        Jasmine
                        tea sits between us. Ba and M·∫π push a large binder of fabric toward me. They‚Äôre thinking of
                        ordering
                        newer place mats and tablecloths for the restaurant, eager to keep up the momentum from Ph·ªü Day.
                        Usually they don‚Äôt bring me into business decisions about the restaurant, but I‚Äôve ‚Äúalways been
                        good
                        with colors,‚Äù Ba said. One of the only occasions he‚Äôd acknowledge my art abilities as an asset,
                        like
                        the ad that I‚Äôd done for the restaurant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I touch one that is the lightest green available, which might soften the harsh
                        lights in our restaurant. We can nd a light beige place mat to match it. Add a small vase of
                        flowers,
                        and I can see it happening. ‚ÄúThis could work.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My parents lift it up, assessing it. There‚Äôs a glint in my mom‚Äôs eyes that I‚Äôve
                        only seen for food. She‚Äôs having a vision for the restaurant, just like my dad. Things are going
                        so
                        well. They‚Äôre happy. I‚Äôm happy too, even though I have a list of things to do. This‚Ä¶ thing with
                        B·∫£o
                        has to be kept safe, con ned to what we do in the art room, secreting moments away from
                        everyone‚Äôs
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I can‚Äôt do anything to upset the balance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood, con,‚Äù Ba says in approval. ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000009.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-143" class="calibre1">I got the text from B·∫£o asking if I could go to the next
                        restaurant. There‚Äôs a blank feeling to his message, a straightforward ask, and I wonder if B·∫£o‚Äôs
                        determined to pretend that our hand-holding didn‚Äôt happen, too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I told everything to Ali, about volunteering, our near escape, our held hands.
                        She
                        said it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre in some romantic comedy or something, but also freely expresses how she
                        thinks
                        we‚Äôre both being ridiculous. In fact, she hasn‚Äôt shut up about it, even as we‚Äôre trying to
                        finish some
                        homework at the restaurant. Ba‚Äôs out running errands, specifically finding a saucepan to replace
                        one of
                        ours with a broken handle. I glance at the tables that used to have our worn white tablecloths,
                        which have now been replaced with the pastel green I liked, the beige place mats to follow soon.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh, is that why you missed out on the Malaysian restaurant the other day?‚Äù
                        Ali
                        asks, light bulb turning on. She asked this after B·∫£o handed in his review and she noticed I
                        hadn‚Äôt
                        sketched anything. I told her how busy I was, mentioning the Gold Keys, and she understood; now
                        my
                        friend rather than the editor in chief was asking me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I say finally. ‚ÄúBut it would have been so awkward.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo what are you going to say to B·∫£o‚Äôs text? No? Then he‚Äôll really think
                        something
                        is up. Don‚Äôt avoid this, Linh.‚Äù She grabs my hand. ‚ÄúI know you. I know you want to disappear
                        into
                        your paintings.‚Äù I try pulling away. ‚ÄúI know you want to keep things inside. B·∫£o seems to want
                        to
                        explore more with you, but if you don‚Äôt want that, you have to tell him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look around to make sure my mom isn‚Äôt nearby. She‚Äôs in the kitchen. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs
                        the
                        problem, Ali. I do want him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her expression doesn‚Äôt change. ‚ÄúThen talk it out, at least.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut our families&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAgain, I‚Äôm not going to pretend I know everything about your families. But
                        sitting
                        here avoiding him will not help at all.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She reaches for my phone and places it between us. ‚ÄúCall him. Or text him. But
                        silence isn‚Äôt the answer. It‚Äôll make things worse.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat will make things worse?‚Äù M·∫π comes by with two glasses of iced co ee for
                        us.
                        She glances between me and Ali expectantly, but neither of us answers. Wants to answer.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-144" class="calibre12">As always, Ali‚Äôs right. Avoiding B·∫£o isn‚Äôt the right way
                        to
                        handle this. And I miss having him in the art room with me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIf we didn‚Äôt get our iced co ees, which we seriously need if we want to stay
                        awake. So much homework,‚Äù Ali says, suddenly perky. She takes a loud sip of her drink. ‚ÄúTastes
                        great, Mrs. Ph·∫°m.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 23</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Ch∆°i ∆†i is the opposite of a traditional Vi·ªát restaurant. The restaurant name
                        itself
                        parodies <i class="calibre5">‚Äútr·ªùi ∆°i,‚Äù</i> an expression my mom likes to use when she‚Äôs annoyed
                        at
                        me or at my dad. But the name turns the exclamation into something more playful&mdash;literally,
                        ‚ÄúPlay!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Inside, the restaurant, located just at the edge of Fountain Valley, has a
                        high-vaulted ceiling and deep red walls brightened by lanterns. Columns are decorated with
                        eye-catching nighttime cityscapes of what looks like Vietnamese cities, rendered from photos.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh had arrived a few minutes before me and was inspecting one of the photos.
                        Of
                        course.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSee something interesting?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh jumps, then brushes back her hair sheepishly. The movement brings my
                        attention
                        to her hand, the one that I held.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd make it,‚Äù I say, watching her closely.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôd almost had to reschedule again, though, because things at work were
                        getting
                        busy for me and Linh. Lisa, the girl who‚Äôd seemed too nervous to work at a restaurant, had
                        called
                        out sick, so Linh had to pick up a shift. I also know the deadline for the Gold Keys was drawing
                        closer and closer. In my texts to her, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do or say to
                        help&mdash;lethologica:
                        the inability to nd the right words&mdash;but being here seems to bring back some spark in her
                        eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She knows how I feel now. Ball‚Äôs in her court.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFigured you needed me,‚Äù she answers simply. ‚ÄúUnless you already have another
                        artist friend lined up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre12">As the host shows us to our seats, I‚Äôm hoping her
                        emphasis on
                        ‚Äúfriend‚Äù isn‚Äôt purposeful.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I focus on the restaurant instead. According to the existing interviews I‚Äôd
                        read
                        online, the owner and executive chef Brian L√™ had trained in Paris, then Italy, but as much as
                        he
                        loved European cuisine, he always considered Vietnamese his</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">rst love&mdash;thanks to his father, who‚Äôs a retired chef. So he came back to
                        the
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">States and opened up his restaurant, which has been reviewed by the <i
                            class="calibre5">New York Times</i> and the <i class="calibre5">Los Angeles Times</i>, which
                        praise his specialty: his <i class="calibre5">b√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø</i>. Not for the rst time, I wonder how
                        Ali
                        managed to be so persuasive that someone with this much notoriety and posh training had agreed
                        to
                        invite two high school students to taste his food.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But the moment Chef L√™ bounds out of the kitchen into the dining room, it all
                        makes
                        sense. Maybe in his late thirties, he wears a worn ball cap backward and his chef‚Äôs jacket is
                        opened
                        to reveal a T-shirt that says, <span class="calibre13">ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN</span> <span
                            class="calibre13">THROUGH INTERPRETIVE DANCE</span>. And his wide grin&mdash;kind of like a
                        kid
                        who was told he could have as much candy as he wanted&mdash;coaxes a smile from us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs good, little ones?‚Äù He gathers each of us into a bear hug. ‚ÄúGlad you‚Äôre
                        here. Brian L√™. Or Chef L√™.‚Äù <i class="calibre5">Now</i> he shakes our hands.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy mom‚Äôs maiden name is L√™,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe we were related way back when, who knows.‚Äù He winks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I like him. ‚ÄúThanks for letting us stop by. Just tell us where we should sit.
                        We
                        won‚Äôt be in anyone‚Äôs way.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSit?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUm yeah, we‚Äôre here to review your menu,‚Äù Linh says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want a tour, too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We didn‚Äôt get a chance to walk around at any other restaurant. Do reviewers
                        usually
                        get this kind of access?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs take you guys to the back where all the magic happens.‚Äù Without
                        waiting for us, he turns and we stand helpless for a few beats until we follow him into his
                        labyrinthine kitchen. It‚Äôs like M·∫π‚Äôs kitchen, only cleaner and probably more organized. And
                        probably
                        sta ed with more people who are less apt to mess up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So, not like our kitchen.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre12">The cooks give us a quick look before focusing back on
                        their
                        dishes. One cook sprinkles chopped raw green onions over a platter of freshly cooked <i
                            class="calibre5">c√° chi√™n</i>, the snapper still sizzling from its quick fry in a saut√© pan.
                        Another guy uses a ladle the size of my hand to transfer bubbling broth into graphite-colored
                        bowls.
                        Even the cooked rice, which someone‚Äôs spooning into bowls, looks better than usual, gleaming
                        under
                        the restaurant‚Äôs expensive lights. I‚Äôm glad my parents aren‚Äôt here to see this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Another chef yells, ‚ÄúBehind!‚Äù before passing us with a large pot smelling of
                        pineapples&mdash;<i class="calibre5">canh chua</i>, most likely. Meanwhile, Chef L√™ points to di
                        erent cooks and their specialties. Picks up ingredients that he insists are totally
                        ‚Äúhigh-grade.‚Äù
                        Narrowly crashes into his employees as they busily rush around, though it‚Äôs all done in odd
                        synchronicity like they‚Äôre used to his chaotic energy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ stops before one large pot in particular. With a flourish, he lifts the
                        lid
                        and beckons us to lean in. ‚ÄúSmell that shit and tell me no one will want to eat it.‚Äù Seeing his
                        expectant look, we do as we‚Äôre told.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú&mdash;delicious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh and I lock eyes before releasing immediately.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">B√∫n b√≤</i>. An earthy, fatty broth, a powerful punch of
                        citrus
                        from lemongrass. It‚Äôs familiar. It‚Äôs home in one punch. Chef L√™ shoots us a smile, likes seeing
                        us
                        con rm how good it smells and <i class="calibre5">looks</i> without us wasting words. Maybe he‚Äôs
                        a
                        bit smug about it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThis is just a preview, of course. Wait until you taste everything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Somehow I wonder if he mistook us for someone else. Linh thinks the same,
                        saying as
                        much to him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNope, I know who you are: Badass high school students.‚Äù He points to us with
                        both
                        index fingers. Me and Linh share another glance, nearly bursting out laughing. What a weird guy.
                        ‚ÄúI
                        was your age once upon a time. When I was in Paris and in Rome, I made things that cost even
                        more
                        than I could a ord. I hated that. And sometimes the food wasn‚Äôt even good. If I can make any
                        Vi·ªát
                        kid your age happy and wanna come to this restaurant, then I guess I did my job.‚Äù He directs us
                        back
                        to where we came in. ‚ÄúNow that you got the tour, let‚Äôs get you back and you can taste all the
                        magic
                        that happens here. You and your girlfriend will love this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-148" class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not&mdash;well&mdash;‚Äù I know I‚Äôm stammering.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat if he‚Äôs <i class="calibre5">my</i> boyfriend and <i
                            class="calibre5">he</i>‚Äôs

                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ smiles again. ‚ÄúOh, touch√©. She‚Äôs got some spice!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre partners,‚Äù I quickly clarify, saying anything so that Chef L√™ doesn‚Äôt
                        get
                        the wrong idea and keep going with the joke, making things even more uncomfortable between me
                        and
                        Linh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Back at the table in the center of the room&mdash;‚ÄúNewly renovated! So you can
                        experience everything,‚Äù Chef L√™ says&mdash;Linh and I sit across from each other, absorbing the
                        furry
                        around us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSettle down and food‚Äôs going to come out in a sec.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I turn to Linh. ‚ÄúDid we even order?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNope, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to have a bad meal here,‚Äù Linh says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A line of servers brings out the appetizers and immediately our table goes from
                        empty to crowded. A good thing, since it makes me less aware of how I‚Äôm sitting, holding myself.
                        How
                        far away my hands are from hers and how weird it‚Äôd be if I reached for her again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Turns out Linh and I have nothing to say to each other. For good reason.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The reason being we‚Äôre more preoccupied with the food that may or may not be
                        better
                        than my mom‚Äôs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIf my parents were here‚Ä¶,‚Äù Linh begins to say into her bowl of <i
                            class="calibre5">b√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThey‚Äôd steal this recipe. Mine would do the same.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry, this recipe is legit sealed,‚Äù says Chef L√™, who‚Äôd come back ve minutes
                        ago
                        to check in on us but sat down as if he was part of the party. I guess this isn‚Äôt unusual for
                        him
                        because the servers set up a plate for him right away. ‚ÄúMy dad would chase me out of California
                        if
                        it somehow leaked.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I grin as I write down his quote. I‚Äôm already ve pages in with my notes&mdash;
                        most
                        of the pages filled with details from the kitchen and atmosphere instead of the actual food.
                        Linh has
                        started some sketches of the appetizers and entrees. ‚ÄúIs your dad the cook in the family?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, Poppa L√™ had a small place in Santa Monica about half the size of this
                        place. I basically grew up there.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre12">‚ÄúOur families have restaurants, too,‚Äù Linh offers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo surprise&mdash;you two have healthy appetites,‚Äù Chef L√™ teases us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhere did the idea of opening up a restaurant come from?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúProbably from my dad. Loved what he did with the place. He just wanted to make
                        customers happy.‚Äù Chef L√™ laughs, now with a faraway glint in his eyes. ‚ÄúI was always tagging
                        around
                        at his place and he‚Äôd yell at me because there was legit no space. My mom, though, she
                        completely
                        disagreed with me going into a culinary career. Even culinary school! It wasn‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ stable,
                        you
                        know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh shifts in her seat, catching the message. Seems like a theme with Vi·ªát
                        mothers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo when I told her I wanted to open a restaurant, she went o on me. I know she
                        was
                        worried then, but we said some stu to each other. Lot of angry words.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat happened after?‚Äù Linh asks quietly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy mom didn‚Äôt talk to me for two years. But it‚Äôs not like we weren‚Äôt a part of
                        each other‚Äôs lives. They lived just a few minutes away from me. I‚Äôd talk to my dad, who always
                        updated me on my mom and what she was doing. <i class="calibre5">Always</i>. I mean, I knew what
                        she‚Äôd bought for groceries because he‚Äôd tell me! It was the same thing for me. I bet my mom knew
                        what I was up to each week.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ points at the entrance as if someone would make an appearance. ‚ÄúThen,
                        the
                        day after I got that <i class="calibre5">Los Angeles Times</i> review was the day my mom
                        appeared at
                        the door. My dad had dropped her o ! He was tired of the fighting and called us the two most
                        stubborn
                        people he‚Äôd ever met.‚Äù He lets out a loud laugh. ‚ÄúAnd we made up, just like that. After that she
                        was
                        always showing up here, playing host but also correcting my chefs‚Äô mistakes, correcting <i
                            class="calibre5">my</i> recipes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTwo years,‚Äù Linh whispers in dismay.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ nods knowingly. ‚ÄúWe lost some time. I think about that all the time now
                        that she‚Äôs gone.‚Äù He pauses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been six and a half months.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That last bit shocks me&mdash;I didn‚Äôt come across that in any of the
                        articles&mdash;and I put down my pencil. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I say, hearing Linh o er the same
                        condolences.
                        The sentence sounds so canned; something I‚Äôm not used to saying. I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs
                        actually
                        lost a parent. I‚Äôve heard about it, but the concept seems so far away. So impossible.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-150" class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you think about her a lot?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLegit the other day. I was creating a recipe, something that I had as a little
                        kid
                        and only my mom could make it. I just wished I‚Äôd asked when she was alive. And then I just had a
                        kid, too, so I‚Äôm wondering how to tell him about my mom. There‚Äôs still so much history that I
                        don‚Äôt
                        know. My dad casually mentioned the other day that he‚Äôd lost a sister when he was six and she
                        was
                        two. Seven siblings I knew about, but not his sister.‚Ä¶‚Äù Chef L√™ trails o , looking back at the
                        kitchen. ‚ÄúHistory, man. There‚Äôs a lot hidden.‚Äù Then he perks up, remembering where he is.
                        ‚ÄúAnyway,
                        I‚Äôm still glad we came back into each other‚Äôs lives. We had a good time together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A server comes by with a message for Chef L√™ from the kitchen. He needs to go
                        back,
                        so he does, leaving me and Linh to ourselves again. A busboy stops by with his bin to clear the
                        plates and we hand them over, too accustomed to doing it ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs nice,‚Äù I tell Linh as she packs up her things.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOne of a kind.‚Äù She turns her notebook upside down, showing me her quick
                        sketch of
                        him, ball cap and T-shirt captured perfectly. Much like my notes, her focus is Chef L√™ and his
                        dynamic personality. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot to unpack.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRight, his mom.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd going two years because she didn‚Äôt like what he was doing. That‚Äôs hard to
                        even
                        imagine.‚Äù She sighs loudly, shoving her colored pencils into her messenger bag. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another
                        reason I don‚Äôt ever see myself telling my mom the truth.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now that we don‚Äôt have any food to distract us, or Chef L√™ to dominate the
                        conversation, or anything else between us, the elephant in the room comes back, the reason for
                        how
                        hesitant we seem to be acting toward each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I say as gently as possible. ‚ÄúCan we talk?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe are.‚Äù All of her emotions have shut o .</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh, I mean about the other day.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can stay longer,‚Äù she says in apology. Her expression is
                        twisted,
                        like it‚Äôs physically hurting her being here. ‚ÄúCan we talk another time?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre thinking.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBelieve me, you don‚Äôt know half of it, B·∫£o,‚Äù she says firmly.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-151" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell, you can tell me, then. Because I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm all
                        ears.
                        Even if you don‚Äôt want&mdash;‚Äù <i class="calibre5">Us.</i> My thoughts pause. What if I‚Äôd
                        misread
                        everything up until now? What if I thought she liked me because I liked her too much and Linh
                        was
                        being too nice to say something? Like how she was nice to Kelly even though she didn‚Äôt have time
                        to
                        volunteer? Like now, how she‚Äôs avoiding it so that she doesn‚Äôt reject me outright?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She‚Äôs barely looking at me. Maybe I‚Äôm closer to the truth than I thought I‚Äôd
                        be.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI can be here as a friend,‚Äù I finally say. ‚ÄúReally, no hard feelings.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she says with such relief that it hurts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù There is a
                        painful pause as Linh pretends to check the table to make sure she hasn‚Äôt forgotten her
                        belongings.
                        I squeeze the back of my chair, fighting the urge to just say something&mdash;anything to make
                        her
                        look at me. Before I can think of anything, Linh says a quiet goodbye and leaves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I exhale. <i class="calibre5">So that‚Äôs it. She doesn‚Äôt feel what I feel.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I head to the front, thanking a Black woman with the name tag Sa ron&mdash;
                        which I
                        had to look at twice; it was too perfect for someone in the business. The way she stands tall
                        reminds me of my mom when she‚Äôs red up and of Linh when she‚Äôs excited about light or some
                        obscure
                        painting that I wouldn‚Äôt know about unless she told me. I feel like I should x my hair and
                        anything
                        else on my body that‚Äôs out of place.</p>

                        divider,
                        wiping his hands on a hand towel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not for you to decide,‚Äù she retorts, ‚Äúsince I own half the place.‚Äù</p>

                        it. He‚Äôs like Anthony Bourdain, rest in peace.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I blink at his unexpected compliment. This is what it means when someone
                        gushes, I
                        guess. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-152" class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou made me think, you know. Not a lot of people know
                        how to

                    <p class="calibre12">I brush the back of my neck. ‚ÄúI was just asking questions.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the best type of interview. You gave me room to just talk.‚Äù He claps me
                        on
                        the shoulder, and I sway from the weight of it. ‚ÄúCome back anytime. You and Linh. I saw some of
                        what
                        she‚Äôs sketching. She seems great, too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe is.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs <i class="calibre5">really</i> not your girlfriend?‚Äù He makes a show
                        of
                        looking over his shoulder. ‚ÄúOr, I‚Äôm sorry, you‚Äôre not really her boyfriend?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, she isn‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYooo,‚Äù he says with a slow-forming smirk, ‚Äúyou like her, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Sa ron elbows him. ‚ÄúBry! Stop teasing him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ just laughs. ‚ÄúGood luck, man.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúCon!‚Äù My mom calls for me the moment I step into the house. <i

                        I
                        must have done wrong. Running through me, though, something I can‚Äôt ignore, is an urge to sit
                        down
                        and just <i class="calibre5">write</i>. Because Chef L√™ is more interesting than I thought he‚Äôd
                        be.
                        Because I‚Äôd rather get lost in writing than think about the failed attempt to talk to Linh about
                        us‚Ä¶
                        about her rejection.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π, just showered, stands in front of the bathroom sink. She leans toward the
                        mirror&mdash;her mirror counterpart looks at me. A Vietnamese ballad spills out from her
                        bedroom. Ba
                        must be at the restaurant still.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she says, and hands the tweezers over. ‚ÄúI need you to pull out a white
                        hair.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom likes to complain that she has so many because of me. I guess I probably
                        shouldn‚Äôt tell her it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs just old.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Sighing, I take the tweezers from her, agreeing to a task that I‚Äôve been
                        subjugated
                        to since I was old enough to hold these things and also since my mom spotted her rst one back
                        when I
                        was in sixth grade. I‚Äôm not the only one, though. Vi·ªát‚Äôs had to do this too.</p>

                        early

                        long.
                        And who would instigate it? ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this guy I met on my assignment. Brian L√™.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúVietnamese. What does he do?‚Äù she asks almost immediately.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the executive chef and owner. He‚Äôs pretty young.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt is hard,‚Äù she answers sagely. ‚ÄúBut impressive for his age.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe was talking about his parents and the things he wanted to ask them.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHis mother died in the past few months.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, and he mentioned not knowing everything he could have known about her
                        while
                        she was alive.‚Äù I thread my fingers through her hair, rechecking my work. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you talk

                        Vietnam more?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI do! I talk about it all the time.‚Äù She looks at me directly through the

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, I know, but more specific things. I know where you lived, what my
                        grandparents did. That you escaped at night. But that‚Äôs more like an overview. Why don‚Äôt you
                        tell me
                        the smaller things?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause you don‚Äôt ask. But the things I do tell you, you always say, ‚ÄòOh, I

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut, if you do want to know more, M·∫π will try to answer you. But my memory
                        isn‚Äôt

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe, but maybe not.‚Äù Silence eases in as I concentrate on her hair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAll of this writing business is making you different.‚Äù Our eyes meet in the
                        mirror

                        crucial
                        ingredient.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood different?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe. You seem less weak.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt expect that kind of question from M·∫π, so I wonder if it‚Äôs a
                        mistranslation.
                        ‚ÄúLike, why am I writing?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôll get a good grade, I guess.‚Äù Even my answer, said out loud,
                        doesn‚Äôt sit right in my head. I couldn‚Äôt care less about the actual journalism class and getting
                        good grades and all that. But I have to admit, I feel more and more solid when I have a pen in
                        hand.
                        When there‚Äôs an article that needs xing and it‚Äôs up to me to make everything sound right. I did
                        that
                        for Steve and Ernie. I did it for myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh had said I‚Äôd nd something to be passionate about. What if she‚Äôs right?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWho is right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Oops, I‚Äôd said that last line out loud. My mom gazes expectantly at me.</p>

                        In some big city. I see nights working under desk lamps. Ink staining my shirt cu s, eyes tight
                        and
                        bleary from unrest. I see words owing from my</p>

                        that‚Äôs for me. As I look back at my mom, I see her contented smile, and the corners of my mouth
                        tilt
                        up. All that nagging she‚Äôs done over the years finally paid o , she‚Äôs likely thinking. And now

                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Two years. Two years that Chef L√™ went without speaking to his mom, despite
                        having
                        the bravery that I lack to follow what he wanted. He‚Äôs made a career of it, yet it took a while
                        for
                        his mother to come back, and that was only by his father‚Äôs doing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm sitting at my desk, finessing my sketch of Chef L√™, who‚Äôs now grinning back
                        at
                        me. I‚Äôll need to redraw it so that it‚Äôs publishable. Other pieces of paper are scattered across
                        my
                        desk, some homework sheets and different drafts of the Scholastic Art Award application. The
                        essay
                        still needs filling out, but everything‚Äôs turning into hieroglyphics and my eyes must be red
                        after me
                        rubbing at them so much. I‚Äôve been struggling to put words to paper, and now I think I‚Äôve highly
                        underestimated what Ali and B·∫£o do seemingly so easily.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My thoughts turn ugly, too many colors mixed together. <i
                            class="calibre5">Would it
                            even matter if I ended up getting this award? Would it do anything? Would it change
                            much?</i> I
                        guess this is what it means to tear your hair out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I wouldn‚Äôt know how to stand it&mdash;me and my mom not talking, for whatever
                        reason. I‚Äôve only done this with Evie; growing up we‚Äôve had a few arguments that all seem
                        childish
                        now, but back then we‚Äôd go days without talking. Instead of trading nasty words, we‚Äôd ght by
                        turning
                        the bedroom lights on and o at inopportune times, seizing control of the washer and dryer even
                        when
                        a load wasn‚Äôt finished, and completely ignoring the car-sharing schedule. The longest silence
                        between
                        us had lasted a week, broken only when Ba had done something ridiculous at the restaurant, and
                        me
                        and Evie accidentally met eyes, sti ing our laughs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But a laugh wouldn‚Äôt solve how much I‚Äôd already lied to my parents.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre12">And then there‚Äôs B·∫£o and that moment outside the
                        supermarket.
                        His questions while we were at Ch∆°i ∆†i.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">If I were anyone other than Linh Mai, someone <i class="calibre5">not</i> from
                        a

                    <p class="calibre12">But I can‚Äôt be. Hence why I practically ran away when B·∫£o broached the topic
                        just
                        as we were leaving.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">What am I even doing anymore?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My phone buzzes in my pocket.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">He never calls me this late. We‚Äôve only texted so far. The deep pitch of his
                        voice
                        through the phone sounds more intimate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù I hold my breath. Not the question I want to ask, because
                        obviously, something happened between us. Something I hope he doesn‚Äôt bring up again, because I
                        can‚Äôt deal with it right now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI wanted to let you know: I‚Äôm going to be a writer.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôve figured it out. It‚Äôs what I want to do. And I wanted you to know

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLucky you.‚Äù I try but I can‚Äôt keep the bitterness from my tone. Immediately, I

                        clearly

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúEver since we met, you haven‚Äôt said I can‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôve just accepted that I

                    <p class="calibre12">I smile, hearing genuine awe in his voice. Ali was my number-one fan before I

                        like a lullaby. The sun is just peeking out over the arched roofs of restaurants and stores, as

                    <p class="calibre12">The two of us are in the kitchen, our steps echoing o the walls. I take a
                        stool.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She dons kitchen gloves and pulls out her wooden cutting board, starts slicing
                        onions. Next to her is a vinegar bath that the cooks made, so M·∫π just needs to complete the
                        pickling
                        process. She dips her finger into the vinegar bath, then adds a spoonful of sugar before dumping
                        in
                        the onions. I watch her stir it, then taste it, before she pushes the bowl toward me. My turn to
                        try
                        it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúV·ª´a kh√¥ng?‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I ignore her question, staring resolutely at the tabletop. Heaving a sigh, my
                        mom
                        leans forward, resting her elbows on the prep table. Her hair has already loosened from its bun.
                        I
                        see bags under her eyes. The guilt that‚Äôs become all too familiar nowadays ares up. But I still
                        hate
                        the idea that I‚Äôm expected to be the replacement when someone else isn‚Äôt available. And the last
                        special would have failed if it weren‚Äôt for B·∫£o‚Äôs help&mdash;which will not happen again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So I look away. I hear my mom‚Äôs lips part, then close. Maybe I‚Äôve made her
                        angry
                        too. Aside from three or four blowups&mdash;including the time when she stumbled across me and
                        Evie
                        drawing pictures with crayons on our old apartment walls&mdash;she‚Äôs been decidedly calmer than
                        Ba.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre12">Instead, her voice takes on its usual soft quality, with
                        an
                        indiscernible tinge. ‚ÄúCon, I know this isn‚Äôt how you want to spend your time. And M·∫π and Ba hate
                        having to ask you to work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt know how hard it was to start up this restaurant. It wasn‚Äôt
                        about
                        inheriting customers, finding new customers. It was inheriting a whole neighborhood of people
                        who
                        didn‚Äôt want us.‚Äù M·∫π‚Äôs voice cracks. Anguish, that‚Äôs the note I‚Äôd heard. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how that
                        feels.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou never told me,‚Äù I retort, though my intent to sound annoyed is weak. I‚Äôve
                        never heard M·∫π sound this way. It tugs the same part of my heart storing all the hugs and kisses
                        and
                        laughs she‚Äôs given me through so many sacrifices.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause you shouldn‚Äôt have to know those things. We wanted to protect you.‚Äù A
                        spike of anger rushes through me. I‚Äôd hate to say it was in response to B·∫£o‚Äôs parents, because
                        that
                        would mean I was angry with him, too. Still, it‚Äôs clear that the cold welcoming had hurt my
                        parents,
                        made them feel less than welcome.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π shakes her head like she‚Äôs denying the memories brought up. ‚ÄúThe gossip was
                        horrible, not just from that restaurant. Everywhere. But if I addressed it, people would add
                        something else to the mix and there‚Äôd be no ending to it. So I ignored it. I put my everything
                        into
                        the food here, to make it speak for itself. Then your dad made friends and we made loyal
                        customers.‚Äù
                        She gestures to the restaurant. ‚ÄúPh·ªü Day made me so happy because it worked out. And now we‚Äôre
                        doing
                        well. But it is always a game here. It‚Äôs always a game to win, to maintain that we belong here.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I wonder if M·∫π means not just this community but in America in general.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I keep my head down. ‚ÄúWill the gossip ever stop? Will we always need to ght
                        B&mdash;‚Äù I catch myself before saying ‚ÄúB·∫£o‚Äôs parents.‚Äù ‚Äú&mdash;the Nguy·ªÖns‚Äô restaurant?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Thankfully, M·∫π doesn‚Äôt seem to notice. ‚ÄúGossip and rumors never stop. They
                        always
                        come back in different forms.‚Äù The knowingness in her voice&mdash;and the palpable feeling that
                        there‚Äôs something more she‚Äôs holding back&mdash;triggers me to glance at her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLike when?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It takes a few beats for M·∫π to make her decision. When she sits down across
                        from
                        me, I lean forward on my stool. ‚ÄúWhen I was eleven. Back in Vietnam,‚Äù my mom starts, ‚ÄúD√¨ V√†ng
                        was
                        ready to marry a neighbor who grew up with her. They were always together, and when our families
                        realized what would happen, we began to set up our meetings to talk about expectations and the
                        future for the two of them. The man was smart, nice, and always put the family rst.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWas he an artist too?‚Äù I try to picture my aunt with a
                        boyfriend or a husband, but I only see her as I do now: her blurry face enlarged on the computer
                        when we‚Äôd speak, her loud, assured voice when she talks about art. That‚Äôs her true love; I can‚Äôt
                        imagine someone else in her life.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù M·∫π answers quickly. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons why your grandparents
                        liked the man, before they passed, was because he was a logical person. He was going to inherit
                        the
                        family business, too. They knew that he would be able to support her when she couldn‚Äôt do that
                        herself with her art.‚Äù I hold back from protesting. She said that as if it were a fact. As if my
                        aunt weren‚Äôt doing well for herself now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOne day, though, he left, apologizing to everyone through a letter. But oh,
                        the
                        gossip! His family and the whole neighborhood were blaming D√¨ V√†ng, as if she had done
                        something,
                        when it was actually him who‚Äôd run away from his promises. His responsibilities.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat happened then?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúWith the guy and with your sister?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI learned that he died.‚Äù That can mean many things: during a battle, during
                        one of
                        the bombings, or during the escape, the same route that my family miraculously survived. ‚ÄúIt is
                        horrible, yes. All of it. He was, at the end of the day, good, and he would have made a good
                        match
                        for my sister.‚Äù I sit back, cupping my tea for warmth, feeling as if a part of me has turned
                        inside
                        out. Her art. That‚Äôs why her art always feels so sad. In each artwork she produces, she leaves
                        that
                        melancholic imprint behind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy I haven‚Äôt heard of this before?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π sighs as she pushes back her hair. ‚ÄúThere was no reason for it to come up.
                        And
                        it is something of the past&mdash;what good will it do to bring it up? Your aunt certainly
                        doesn‚Äôt
                        mention it. We are in the present now&mdash;we look to the future.‚Äù She takes an apron o the
                        hook
                        and o ers me my apron. ‚ÄúWe ignore all gossip and do our best.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCon, I know you are busy. But you did such a good job last time. You can do it
                        again. And you will survive your schoolwork. Because you are my daughter.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre12">I take the apron from M·∫π. She smiles, and it‚Äôs so
                        grateful
                        and so understanding that I muster up a smile, the weight on my shoulders even more insistent.

                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">In the newsroom, just as the dismissal bell rings to let out class, the phone
                        rings,
                        too. Shouldering past our classmates flooding out of the room, Ali answers with a brisk tone. I
                        can
                        see her in the future now, poised over the phone, a notepad and pen in hand. She waits for a few
                        minutes until she turns, xing me with a look. I start walking past her, but she stops me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB·∫£o, it‚Äôs for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That‚Äôs new. I take the phone as cautiously as if I was just asked to take care
                        of
                        some dangerous creature. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, hi. I‚Äôm in school right now.‚Äù Is he calling about the article? It doesn‚Äôt
                        sound like he‚Äôs calling to yell about how bad it was. I picture him at the same table, his chef
                        jacket‚Äôs sleeves rolled up. Maybe with his feet propped on the seat across from him until his
                        wife,
                        Sa ron, comes by to smack them o .</p>

                        purpose.
                        ‚ÄúI dig it and was wondering if she did things like that on the side. Either draw or paint on a
                        large-scale.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFantastic. So here‚Äôs the thing: A lot of the decor at my restaurant is pretty
                        modern, but I have this one column in the back of the restaurant that needs some TLC. I was
                        thinking
                        a big-ass mural. You got her number?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúUh, sure. Hold on.‚Äù I pull out my phone and read out the number. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre
                        going
                        to pay her?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat, are you an agent now?‚Äù He laughs. ‚ÄúYes, dude, I‚Äôll totally pay her.
                        There‚Äôs
                        no such thing as free labor.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali watches me expectantly, arms crossed. I hang up a few seconds later and
                        face
                        Ali, who asks almost immediately, ‚ÄúAre we in trouble?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Dazed by the quick turn of events&mdash;from Chef L√™‚Äôs praise, which I wish I
                        could
                        have recorded for posterity, and his o er to Linh&mdash;I shake my head. ‚ÄúI think Linh just got

                    <p class="calibre1">On a Sunday, we drive to the other side of Westminster to celebrate one of my
                        second
                        (or third?) cousins‚Äô rst birthdays. Walking into the house, we see a layer of shoes swamping the
                        front door: Nikes, Crocs, loafers from various relatives who‚Äôve flocked there for the
                        celebration.
                        Cousins and nieces and nephews, or second cousins if you want to be technical, dash through the
                        hallways only to stop when my aunt&mdash;one of my father‚Äôs many cousins&mdash;emerges from the
                        kitchen with a pair of chopsticks in hand that foretells their fate if they misbehave. A mom
                        chases
                        after her toddler, who dashes around with Usain Bolt&ndash;like speed, as if knowing that his
                        mom
                        will give up if she‚Äôs too tired. I give her maybe fifteen minutes and she‚Äôll start bargaining
                        food for
                        her love: <i class="calibre5">ƒÇn ƒëi con. ƒÇn ƒëi con ƒë·ªÉ cho M·∫π th∆∞∆°ng.</i></p>

                        that she fretted over last night. But the kitchen table, as we discover, is already covered end
                        to
                        end with food that no one was asked to make but brought anyway. Somehow, with gatherings like
                        this,
                        no one ever brings duplicate items. I see someone already provided the egg rolls: crispy and hot

                        of
                        rice cakes just small enough to t your palm, are paired with jugs of sh sauce ranging from mild
                        to
                        burning o your tongue, which is what most of the men here like.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">C·∫≠u Tr√≠, who I‚Äôm glad I only have to see occasionally, makes a point to serve
                        me
                        the mildest sh sauce. Asshole. After a round of mandatory greetings and pretending to recognize
                        all
                        of the guests, I sit down at the men‚Äôs table&mdash;a bunch of tucked-in polos, belts, and a few
                        Bluetooths glued to their ears. They‚Äôre red-faced after a few bottles of Heineken and Corona and
                        don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So I end up drifting toward the kitchen to grab a drink. Vi·ªát‚Äôs already there,
                        and
                        you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be shocked to nd him surrounded by women forty years older than him, gossiping
                        and
                        cooking together. Yet, still, it looks like he‚Äôs been there all along. He stirs vinegar and
                        sugar in
                        a bowl. The conversation sounds heated, and I catch a few harsh words in rapid Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo how did you get roped into this?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He tastes the dressing. ‚ÄúMy mom knows one of the other moms or something. One
                        of
                        the delivery customers.‚Äù Which is the answer you would expect at this type of gathering.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát quickly catches me up on the gossip getting swapped around.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Apparently some guy they all knew couldn‚Äôt nd a wife here, so he went back home
                        to
                        Vietnam and miraculously got married. They‚Äôre due to come back in</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">ve weeks, but <i class="calibre5">where will they stay? What are they going to
                            do?</i> The wife doesn‚Äôt</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">speak basic English, from what they‚Äôre saying. From the snide comments and the
                        tsking, I don‚Äôt think the new couple‚Äôs gonna have it easy here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúC‚Äômon, let‚Äôs grab something to eat,‚Äù he says, shaking out his wrists. How long
                        has
                        he been stirring?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We leave the kitchen. I think Vi·ªát‚Äôs mom calls his name, but he doesn‚Äôt react,
                        so
                        maybe that‚Äôs my imagination.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát and I are relegated to sit at the kids‚Äô table. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll be at
                        this
                        table until I‚Äôm married, whenever that happens. Vi·ªát is across from me, while twelve-year-old
                        twins&mdash;maybe directly related to me?&mdash;violently elbow each other, then stab each other
                        with chopsticks, until their mother comes over and hisses at them to behave. Another cousin, ve
                        years old, stares at me with a mouthful of rice, snot running down her nose. She uses her tongue
                        to
                        wipe some clean, even as her own mother tries to shove another spoonful into her mouth.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-168" class="calibre12">Not the best seasoning.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Other kids continue to wreak havoc, seizing an escape from supervision. ‚ÄúHe
                        farted!‚Äù yells a little girl as she dashes across the living room, earning bemused looks from
                        the
                        adults.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Seconds later: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt <i class="calibre5">ƒë·ªãt</i>! I didn‚Äôt <i
                            class="calibre5">ƒë·ªãt</i>!‚Äù a boy, maybe her brother, screams, running in the same direction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúKids are fascinating,‚Äù Vi·ªát deadpans.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My dad‚Äôs other cousin comes over, tells us to stand up, that she hasn‚Äôt seen us
                        for
                        ages. I lean on my toes to look taller than Vi·ªát, but he beats me by standing straight, for
                        once.
                        Then the subject, as always, turns to where we‚Äôre planning to apply to school.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour mom tells me you are going for the big schools,‚Äù she says to Vi·ªát,
                        impressed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He answers dutifully. ‚ÄúTrying for it. I want to major in biology and then
                        become a
                        doctor.‚Äù But why does he sound so dulled by it?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour mom tells me you have the grades for it, too!‚Äù Then her eyes slide over
                        to
                        me. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ con?‚Äù This aunt knows by now that my chances of going to the same schools as Vi·ªát are
                        close to nonexistent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm still deciding.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her smile fades. She saves herself by plastering on a fake one. As if my
                        self-esteem weren‚Äôt already low enough.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Here‚Äôs Vi·ªát, who can probably get in anywhere. And me. Then again, I don‚Äôt
                        think
                        Vi·ªát‚Äôs ever said if he liked any particular college, let alone the idea of going to med school.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou serious about majoring in biology?‚Äù I ask once the aunt disappears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát shrugs, picks at his papaya salad. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an answer that gets them to stop
                        asking.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôd use that answer if only I knew people wouldn‚Äôt immediately call me a liar.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-169" class="calibre12">‚ÄúSeriously, what <i class="calibre5">do</i> you want to
                        do?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúForensic science.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo surprise there,‚Äù I joke. He stares at his food, not saying anything for a
                        moment. He‚Äôs usually not this quiet, not with me. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMentioned the idea of it to my parents the other day. They yelled at me for
                        hours.
                        My ears kept ringing after.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Maybe that‚Äôs why he avoided his mom before. When he talks about his parents, I
                        don‚Äôt exactly think of the word ‚Äúempathetic.‚Äù It‚Äôs his mother‚Äôs shrewdness that my mom admires.
                        Vi·ªát‚Äôs father‚Äôs honesty has earned my paranoid father‚Äôs trust. But emotionally, they‚Äôre not the
                        people to rely on. And they‚Äôre strict when it comes to Vi·ªát‚Äôs studies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù he says, reading my look. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just another reason for my parents
                        to
                        ght. They‚Äôve been doing that for way too long.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut forensic science is still a type of science. It has a lot to do with
                        biology,
                        right? Shouldn‚Äôt they be happy? I mean‚Ä¶ maybe they‚Äôll come around to it?‚Äù I say unconvincingly.
                        I
                        always assumed Vi·ªát‚Äôs situation was better than mine. But then again, these days, I‚Äôm assuming a
                        lot. Especially when it comes to Linh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát smiles. It‚Äôs the quiet kind. The sad kind. Because he knows that my words
                        can‚Äôt be much help now, can‚Äôt change things. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre never happy these days.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We sit in silence, scraping our paper plates clean. I want to ll it with
                        something,
                        so I tell him, ‚ÄúI kind of told my mom that I wanted to be a writer.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúA writer.‚Äù Vi·ªát stares blankly at me, and I swallow, realizing that he‚Äôd just
                        told
                        me how his parents were shutting down his dream. I‚Äôm an asshole. This was what Vi·ªát was talking
                        about before about me, him, and Linh having di erent variations of parents. Different
                        circumstances
                        in which we are either allowed to go for our dreams‚Ä¶ or not.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I breathe easier when a genuine smile blooms across his face. He punches my
                        shoulder. <i class="calibre5">Fuck.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDude, no way! What did she say?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I rub my shoulder. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt blow up on me. She said I could use the basement
                        if
                        I didn‚Äôt get a job.‚Äù Which isn‚Äôt so nice when you say it out loud. But Vi·ªát knows my mom and her
                        weird sense of humor.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe fact that she didn‚Äôt get angry is something big!‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not serious or anything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúC‚Äômon, you know that‚Äôs the best you can get from them.‚Äù He shakes his head at
                        a
                        thought he doesn‚Äôt voice to me. ‚ÄúSometimes I can‚Äôt believe how fast things move.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like this. We were in our own worlds. Me with cross country. You with‚Ä¶
                        um.
                        Actually I don‚Äôt know which world you really belonged to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat makes me feel really good about myself.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúObviously you‚Äôve found your shit. We‚Äôre growing up. You‚Äôre becoming a writer,
                        falling in love&mdash;‚Äù My heart wheezes at his choice of words. I haven‚Äôt told him about Linh
                        essentially rejecting me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hadn‚Äôt even had a chance to talk to Linh one-on-one, or mention Chef L√™,
                        who‚Äôs
                        trying to reach her. Last I heard, she hasn‚Äôt responded to his calls.</p>

                    <p class="calibre1">There were many failed attempts at singing karaoke. Plus, the little ones needed
                        to
                        go to sleep soon, including the birthday boy. So, the night ends with a tradition. Twelve items

                        be his profession in the future. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all for fun, but I think the parents are secretly

                        mesmerized
                        by the camera lights shining on him. Then he glances at the items: a calculator, a fork, a toy
                        stethoscope, and other random things from around the house. After a few minutes of goading and
                        laughing from his audience, he scrabbles for the stethoscope, causing everyone to cheer. He
                        sucks on

                    <h3>Chapter 26</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Gold Key. Ph·ªü Day Part II. Gold Key. B·∫£o. Gold Key. B·∫£o. There are so many
                        things
                        competing for purchase in my mind. I want to shut o these rivaling thoughts, but my normal way
                        of
                        coping&mdash;painting or sketching&mdash;isn‚Äôt happening as easily. I‚Äôm fidgeting, my attention
                        straying. I made the mistake of looking in the mirror this morning and could have sworn that a
                        ghoul
                        was staring back at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm in the art room during lunch, as usual, feeling B·∫£o‚Äôs absence. The window
                        curtains are drawn to block the afternoon light, but not enough to block the rays completely.
                        The
                        room is awash with pale blue and it calms me so much. I‚Äôm in the center of the room, earplugs in
                        to
                        try to get myself to focus, though I end up preoccupied by the motes of dust seemingly suspended
                        in
                        the air.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My phone vibrates once. I look over and see that unfamiliar number again. I‚Äôve
                        gotten it two times already. Probably spam, so I‚Äôve been ignoring it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey, Linh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I pause, wanting to see if I have to turn to greet him. He‚Äôll see the ghoul
                        that
                        was me this morning. When I do turn around, his expression doesn‚Äôt change. ‚ÄúYou busy? Need to
                        talk
                        to you&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I brush back my hair, nervous. ‚ÄúB·∫£o&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He holds up a hand. A sheepish smile is on his face. ‚ÄúNot about <i
                            class="calibre5">that</i>. It‚Äôs actually something that Chef L√™ mentioned to me. Did he call
                        you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúChef L√™?‚Äù Now I‚Äôm confused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah&mdash;‚Äù His eyes catch on something to his right. He laughs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-173" class="calibre12">He points to his hair, then to mine. I mimic the gesture
                        and
                        thread my fingers through mine, feeling something wet&mdash;it‚Äôs <i class="calibre5">paint</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, shoot.‚Äù I whirl around, trying to spot the roll of Bounty that I always
                        keep
                        around, but I can‚Äôt find it. Embarrassment flushes my face. <i class="calibre5">Great.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When I turn back, B·∫£o is there, gently grabbing the wet piece of hair and
                        dabbing
                        it with a paper towel. I hold my breath, relishing the feel of him close to me, the feel of his
                        eyes
                        on me. His touch. Tender.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere,‚Äù he whispers. ‚ÄúAll better.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He steps away and I feel my shoulders fall. My heart pumps at an indecent pace.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o realizes what he‚Äôs done and he drops the towel on the nearest stool. ‚ÄúUm,
                        anyway. Chef L√™‚Äôs been trying to reach you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh!‚Äù I glance at my phone. The strange number. ‚ÄúWhat does he want?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His smile looks strained. ‚ÄúGive him a call back. He‚Äôll explain. But I think
                        it‚Äôll
                        be good news. It might actually be fun, you know. It‚Äôs perfect for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He stands, shoulders slightly hunched, unsure. Before, he would have made
                        himself
                        comfortable at his own table. Might have even hovered nearby to peek at my work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hate that I did this. The stilted conversation, the pauses. It‚Äôd been easy
                        before. Now everything‚Äôs changed because of these feelings&mdash;because of all that‚Äôs working
                        against us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôll see you later, Linh,‚Äù B·∫£o finally says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The room is awash in more shadows than I realized.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">If I looked tired earlier, I can only imagine how I look now, even more so with
                        the
                        mystery of Chef L√™‚Äôs message weighing heavily in my mind. My parents aren‚Äôt as tactful about my
                        appearance when I come to work. Ba‚Äôs straightening the tablecloths that just came in. I was
                        right.
                        It made the light inside less piercing to the eyes. It‚Äôs almost like spring has come to the
                        restaurant. The fake daisies that we bought complete the picture.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre12">My dad stares at me a little longer. <i
                            class="calibre5">‚ÄúCon
                            b·ªánh h·∫£?‚Äù</i> He uses the back of his hand to feel my forehead, checking if I‚Äôm sick.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">M·∫π s·∫Ω</i> make ginger tea,‚Äù M·∫π says, standing up from her
                        booth, where she was eating an early dinner.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Ng·ªìi xu·ªëng ƒëi</i>,‚Äù Ba suggests to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBa, M·∫π, I‚Äôm ne.‚Äù I brush away his hand. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt put on makeup this
                        morning.‚Äù <i class="calibre5">And I also have too much to worry about</i>. But the closeness
                        allows
                        me to see the bags under his eyes. He must be worried about Ph·ªü Day again. We‚Äôre all worrying,
                        them
                        more than me. My issues pale by comparison to theirs.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou look worse than that.‚Äù Ba turns to M·∫π. ‚ÄúPerhaps she should go home and
                        sleep.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm okay,‚Äù I grumble, even as the thought of bed is enticing. A chance to
                        be
                        alone and recharge.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRight, she should sleep.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba says firmly, having M·∫π‚Äôs agreement, ‚ÄúSleep. We want you to be rested for Ph·ªü
                        Day.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">But I don‚Äôt go home, not right away, at least. Instead, I‚Äôm sitting in my car
                        outside Ch∆°i ∆†i. After leaving my parents‚Äô restaurant, I drove around mindlessly, taking the
                        longer
                        route home, an excuse to clear my mind. But then I remembered the missed calls from Chef L√™‚Äôs
                        number. I shoved my phone away in hopes that I wouldn‚Äôt need to think about it. Or think about
                        B·∫£o.
                        Before I knew it, though, I reached down for it, and started driving.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The parking lot is relatively bare, but I expect it to ll up around dinnertime,
                        which is within an hour.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Why does he want to see me?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I meet Sa ron, his wife, at the front. ‚ÄúMy husband was raving about your
                        sketch!‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, thank you, I‚Äôm glad he liked it.‚Äù My voice comes out at. <i
                            class="calibre5">Did I sound like this the whole day?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her smile falters by a fraction. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-175" class="calibre12">I sidestep the question. ‚ÄúUm, is Chef L√™ around?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh! He‚Äôll be happy to see you. The column‚Äôs been something of a sore spot for
                        us,
                        and he couldn‚Äôt figure out what to do until he saw your work. He knew you‚Äôd be the right person
                        to
                        dress it up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Column? It hits me then, that I hadn‚Äôt even thought to listen to his voicemail.
                        But
                        now it all connects.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">At her words, the rst spark of warmth comes back to me. Chef L√™ actually wants
                        to
                        hire me? A high school student?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGo ahead, you can nd him in the back.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm heading in that direction until I see the tape cutting o a section of the
                        restaurant, a curtain shrouding that part in mystery, keeping it out of sight from wandering
                        customers. Curiosity getting the best of me, I cross the room and part the curtains to face the
                        white column. It‚Äôs a good size, with a lot of space to work with. Done right, it could make a
                        nice
                        splash.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMiss Mai!‚Äù Chef L√™ says, dropping a towel that he was using to wipe his hands.
                        ‚ÄúGlad you got my message.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIs this&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He nods, slapping the column. ‚ÄúYep, the real estate.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A vision of what it could be surges forward in my mind. This column is in the
                        center of the room, so it should naturally draw the eye. It needs bold colors, ones that won‚Äôt
                        clash
                        with the rest of the walls, but complement them. Mostly, the decor already shows o landscapes.
                        What
                        we need now are people. Faces as vivid as the discerning ones who will come to dine here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Emerging from my thoughts, I almost miss the amount he‚Äôs offering to pay me. I
                        ask
                        him to repeat himself. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre gonna try to say that‚Äôs too much, I‚Äôm not going to listen,‚Äù he
                        says good-humoredly. He reminds me of my parents, how they don‚Äôt let anyone refuse payment.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù I manage to ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ tips his head back and his laugh bounces o the walls.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLike I told B·∫£o, I know talent. You‚Äôre talented, Linh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Talent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A wave of sadness catches me o guard. It travels up inside me, splitting into
                        tendrils. There are people who have faith in me, and they shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not the person they
                        need.
                        I‚Äôm always second-guessing myself, running away scared.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-176" class="calibre12">I touch the column with my fingertips; it‚Äôs damp and
                        newly
                        painted with base coat. I spot the tarp and drops of white, and I see a pair of Converse. Red.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o. Sa ron appears right behind him, carrying some towels. ‚ÄúChef L√™, where do
                        you
                        want&mdash;Linh?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look closer. The edges of his sleeves appear as if they‚Äôd been dipped in
                        white as
                        well. Some specks are on his jeans.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Did B·∫£o do this? Was B·∫£o actually painting?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRight over there‚Äôs good. You came just in time. I‚Äôm trying to strike a deal
                        with
                        Linh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù B·∫£o stays put, glancing between the column and me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposed to paint the column, not yourself,‚Äù I say, fighting back a
                        smile. He
                        offers an uncertain one in return. Another pause, one that Saffron appears to notice, because
                        she sets
                        down the towels, then coughs delicately.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBry, I need to talk to you for a sec. Over there?‚Äù She‚Äôs already walking back
                        out
                        toward the curtains.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat, now?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYup.‚Äù She disappears outside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ follows half in, half out. ‚ÄúBut, Sa &mdash;‚Äù There‚Äôs some whispering,
                        growing more insistent. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, leave them alone? We‚Äôre just&mdash;‚Äù A hand grabs his
                        collar, yanking him through the curtains, out of view. I look over at B·∫£o, who‚Äôs watching in
                        bewildered amusement. He catches me peeking and normally we‚Äôd laugh together, but he sobers up
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He examines his sleeves. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be at work?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy parents sent me home. They think I might be getting sick.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He frowns in worry, and walks closer, less hesitantly then he had before. My
                        heart
                        leaps when he touches me on the forehead. That doesn‚Äôt help things. ‚ÄúI knew you looked off
                        before.
                        Shouldn‚Äôt you be in bed, then?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sick. I‚Äôm just tired.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou have a lot going on,‚Äù he murmurs. His hand curves around my jaw, his thumb
                        lingering on my cheek. He stays like this longer than I think he realizes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And when he does, he takes a wide step back. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs&mdash;‚Äù Again, the air between us tightens. ‚ÄúWhy are you here, B·∫£o?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-177" class="calibre12">‚ÄúI had a day off. So I decided to stop by and give a hard
                        copy
                        of my piece to Chef L√™. And then we just got to talking and he wanted to get the column ready.‚Äù
                        He
                        quickly rushes to add, ‚ÄúBut I told him you didn‚Äôt say yes yet. He just got excited and pulled
                        out
                        all of this and before I knew it&mdash;‚Äù He gestures to the mess on his clothes. ‚ÄúWhen Chef L√™
                        wants
                        something, he just does it, apparently.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I circle the column, my fingers tracing the parts that are relatively dry. B·∫£o
                        follows close behind like there‚Äôs a string loosely connecting us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúA small part of me, I guess, was still hoping you‚Äôd show up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut you couldn‚Äôt have known I‚Äôd come here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Still, he came. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù The earnestness of his statement moves the ground
                        beneath
                        me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The column. Big and vast. There are so many designs it can take. So many
                        possibilities in every way. I can paint another cityscape. I can paint the people that Chef L√™
                        holds
                        closest to him: his wife, his dad, his late mom. I can make the colors as bright as they can
                        be&mdash;I can use normal colors; I can mix my own. I can make something beautiful out of this.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Inside, the tendrils of anxiety settle down. I take a deep breath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o‚Äôs offering these options to me. Just like the night he stepped over enemy
                        lines
                        to help me. He always wants to help me. I‚Äôm always the one to turn him away, always having a
                        reason
                        to keep a distance. This understanding touches me in a way I can‚Äôt voice with words, and God, I
                        wish
                        I could paint my feelings right here for him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Yet, words&mdash;my inadequate words&mdash;are all I have in this moment. So I
                        choose.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHypothetically, if I accept Chef L√™‚Äôs o er, it‚Äôd take a lot of work to get
                        this
                        mural done.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A handsome smile graces his face. ‚ÄúYou could do this. I‚Äôve seen your work.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôd be hard, too. I probably won‚Äôt know what to do with it half the time.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ne. Inspiration doesn‚Äôt come that easily.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something just for me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o nods again. ‚ÄúAfter all the things you‚Äôre doing, you deserve a break
                        sometimes.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre12">‚ÄúEven though I still wouldn‚Äôt know what to do about our
                        families.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs oka&mdash;‚Äù He levels his gaze at me. ‚ÄúLinh?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I say in a rush, before tackling him with a side-hug that coaxes a
                        short laugh from him. After hesitating for a millisecond, his arms come around me, and we lean
                        into
                        each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When I paint, there‚Äôs always a moment where I <i class="calibre5">just know</i>
                        that I‚Äôm finally</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">finished. The colors and textures come together to depict a feeling of <i
                            class="calibre5">rightness</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Us, here, is that rightness.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I breathe him in. I nestle my head into the crook of his neck, fitting myself
                        into
                        him like a piece of puzzle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Yes, I want him. I want us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Him loosening his hold on me and the sharp catch in his breath tell me he</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">finally gets it. Still, he leans back to con rm the answer. A hand that circled
                        my</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">waist slides up my arm. The other gently, so gently, remains on my hip. A ne
                        shiver
                        passes through me and I hold my breath, but my heart hiccups. He cups my cheek with a hand and
                        his
                        face inches forward.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCan I?‚Äù he asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I meet him there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ecstatic colors surround us, the happiest of colors, yellow, orange, pink
                        swirling.
                        Blooming. Like we‚Äôre in Monet‚Äôs <i class="calibre5">Water Lilies</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">No. This is all mine. This is <i class="calibre5">my painting</i>. I want to
                        memorize this feeling and make my own masterpiece.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I press my lips against his more insistently. He makes a small noise of
                        surprise,
                        but I feel his smile. It‚Äôs surreal, us kissing here. I‚Äôve tried to tamp down all of these
                        feelings
                        for the wrong reason, but now I can show them. This, <i class="calibre5">this</i> feels so
                        right:
                        the quiet smack of lips parting before coming together, the exhaling out of noses, and his hand
                        light against my neck, keeping me in place&mdash;not that I ever, ever want to move away. All I
                        care
                        about right now is his arms around me, his lips on mine, and the utter freedom I feel to slide
                        my
                        hands through his hair. Finally.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 27</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I‚Äôd showed up here without any expectations and just started painting.
                        Everything
                        was already there; Chef L√™ had already bought everything Linh would need, so sure that she‚Äôd
                        answer
                        his call and accept the offer. I didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell him that Linh was already busy,
                        and
                        this was the last thing she needed to add to her pile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then she appeared. The white of the column glowed under the light and she was
                        entranced. I was entranced by her. But I tried to hide it. Act like we‚Äôre just friends because
                        that‚Äôs what we are. Just friends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Is it possible to be this happy?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Our kiss steals the air from my lungs, and that‚Äôs the only reason I eventually
                        pull
                        away from Linh. I rest my forehead against hers, disoriented. I never thought I‚Äôd ever feel
                        weak-kneed&mdash;that was for damsels in distress or elderly people with low blood
                        pressure&mdash;but I guess it‚Äôs the same for first kisses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs eyes are hazy when I look into them, then I watch them clear up, reality
                        rushing back with a vengeance. I read all of this easily because I know her worries. Some of
                        them
                        are mine exactly. She opens her mouth. ‚ÄúJust pause,‚Äù I say, desperate to keep the moment to
                        ourselves. Her mouth closes. ‚ÄúWe can delay it for a few more minutes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like me,‚Äù she says, half teasingly. ‚ÄúBut once we step outside,
                        nothing‚Äôs changed. We‚Äôll still be B·∫£o Nguy·ªÖn and Linh Mai, whose families hate each other.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut here,‚Äù I counter, arms going around her waist, ‚Äúeven if it‚Äôs just for a
                        little
                        while, we‚Äôre B·∫£o Nguy·ªÖn and Linh Mai, food reviewer and artist. And we‚Äôve made it work for the
                        past
                        few months,‚Äù I try saying.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre12">Linh smiles sadly because she knows I‚Äôm stalling. Her
                        hand
                        goes back into my hair, and if I could ever pick a moment to freeze, it‚Äôd be now, with that
                        tender
                        look in her eyes. Tired, yet hopeful. Indulgent. Actually, just one adjective wouldn‚Äôt be enough
                        to
                        explain it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey.‚Äù I touch her chin, marveling that I‚Äôm allowed to do this. How easily it
                        comes
                        to me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out. One step at a time.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she says before kissing me. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the next step?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I try to think of lighter things that don‚Äôt have to do with our families, a
                        breach
                        we‚Äôll need to figure out how to navigate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm your boyfriend.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI would think that was obvious.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI guess Ali and Vi·ªát saw this coming before us. We‚Äôll need to let them know.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Ali knew how I felt, but Vi·ªát did, too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúApparently they talk to each other. About us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh God.‚Äù Linh rests her forehead against my chest. She mumbles something that
                        I
                        can‚Äôt hear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRomeo and Juliet. Ali‚Äôs not going to shut up about us being Romeo and Juliet
                        now.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe kind of are,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúOur parents hate each other. Our secret meetings.
                        This
                        column looks like it‚Äôd even t the time period.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you saying you‚Äôre going to poison yourself? Will I need to nd a dagger
                        somewhere?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd a tomb. We need to be prepared.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She laughs, but doesn‚Äôt say anything. Just lets me hold her. Or she‚Äôs holding
                        me.
                        It‚Äôs all the same at this point.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">From behind the curtain, I hear Chef L√™ and Saffron whisper-arguing. ‚ÄúSo should
                        I
                        knock, then?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBry, baby, it‚Äôs a curtain. You can‚Äôt knock.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000017.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-181" class="calibre1">After letting Chef L√™ bear-hug us&mdash;Sa ron shaking her
                        head all the while&mdash;and tell us how he ‚Äúknew it,‚Äù we talk about the column and his initial
                        vision. He wants it to complement the red wall yet act like a statement piece&mdash;something to
                        lure people when they come into the dining room. He hands Linh a couple of photos of his
                        family&mdash;many of them of his mother from throughout her life. They remind me of the
                        black-and-white photos on our wall and our family altars. When my relatives were posing for
                        those
                        portraits, I wonder if they knew what they‚Äôd be used for, if their sober stares were made on
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ultimately, Chef L√™ says, he‚Äôs leaving other elements up to Linh but he‚Äôd like
                        to
                        have his family incorporated somehow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI have a few ideas,‚Äù Linh says, holding the photo while doing another walk
                        around
                        the column, taking in how much space she has to work with. She‚Äôs very much an artist at work,
                        not
                        some high school student playing around.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And she‚Äôs my girlfriend. <i class="calibre5">Girlfriend.</i> I beam at her,
                        even if
                        she‚Äôs not paying me any attention. I think about the kiss. I think about her worries. And of
                        course,
                        thoughts of my mom and dad seep in, threatening to taint these new feelings, but I hold on to
                        the
                        memory of our kiss.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ spreads out the photos, moving them around like puzzle pieces. He‚Äôs
                        explaining what he knows about them so that Linh can decide which ones to work with.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When we first met him, he talked about the questions he had that will never be
                        answered. He talked about discovering parts of his past in innocuous, unexpected ways.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">If I look into my family‚Äôs past, could I nd an answer that would explain today?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh is arranging times to start on the mural and unexpectedly throws a
                        question my
                        way. ‚ÄúAre you free for the next couple of Thursdays? Chef L√™ says that works for him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you want me here too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course I want you here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ paint?‚Äù I gesture to my clothing. Linh‚Äôs face twists. Ah. That‚Äôs an
                        obvious
                        answer.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-182" class="calibre12">Saffron steps in smoothly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to just hang
                        around. Do homework and the like. Bry will try not to bother you too much.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAlways trying to insult me, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I ask, ignoring Chef L√™. Linh squeezes my arm excitedly. ‚ÄúSure, I can
                        do
                        that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In an irreverent move that only Chef L√™ could manage, he finger-guns me. And I
                        guess
                        we have a deal.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 28</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The next morning, my alarm clock doesn‚Äôt wake me. No, it‚Äôs someone tickling me
                        awake, pulling me out of pleasant dreams. I was stuck in a painting of my own, but I was happy.
                        I
                        could paint with my hands, no brush needed, and everything I touched took on color. I walked
                        into a
                        little cabin at the end of a long rainbow road, and opened the door, and I think it might have
                        been
                        B·∫£o standing with his back to me. I reached out to tap his shoulder, but a pair of hands got me
                        from
                        behind&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I jerk out of bed and ip the light switch on.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Evie.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat are you doing here so early?‚Äù I exclaim, launching myself at her as she
                        catches me, laughing. She smells like a brand-new car.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba was supposed to leave in an hour to drive her here. ‚ÄúI rented a car to drive
                        in
                        myself. Didn‚Äôt think Ba needed to be up this early,‚Äù she says. That explains the smell. ‚ÄúBut
                        here
                        you are, sleeping in. How lazy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I glance at the alarm clock. Seven in the morning. ‚ÄúHardly.‚Äù I push back my
                        hair,
                        mussed from sleep, and focus on her. She‚Äôs wearing her UC Davis sweatshirt again, the hood
                        covering
                        her hair. Her eyes are alive, probably hyped from the co ee she must have guzzled down during
                        the
                        long trip. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt leave you three to fend for yourselves.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hug her again, the strength of it surprising me and her. But she doesn‚Äôt say
                        anything else.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôd been so mad for the past few weeks, busy with the Gold Key submissions, my
                        feelings for B·∫£o&mdash;just having so many thoughts weigh me down. I know it was sel sh. I know
                        I
                        could have handled it all better. If Evie were in my place, she would have handled it
                        differently for
                        sure.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-184" class="calibre12">But now that I was honest with B·∫£o, that‚Äôs one thing o my
                        chest. As for the other things?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOuch, Linh. You‚Äôre hugging me way too tightly!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs rare for me to wake up before my parents, but it‚Äôs all worth it, watching
                        Evie
                        tiptoe into their bedroom down the hall, leaning down close and blowing air into Ba‚Äôs left ear.
                        He
                        lets out a snort, lurches over. His arm swings up until he realizes who‚Äôs right beside him.
                        ‚ÄúCon!‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúG√¨?‚Äù</i> M·∫π says blearily. Then she‚Äôs instantly awake.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π playfully slaps my sister‚Äôs arm, scolding her for driving all night and not
                        letting any of us know. What could have happened on the road? And she was alone! But her wide
                        smile
                        undercuts her rebuke; she‚Äôs happy to see Evie here. I‚Äôm reminded of past Sundays when my sister
                        and
                        I would sneak into their bed, crawling like toddlers until we could sandwich M·∫π and nearly knock
                        Ba
                        o his side. We‚Äôre older now, all grown up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We could still knock Ba over, if we really wanted to.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">After showering, I walk down to the kitchen. M·∫π makes a feast for breakfast like
                        she‚Äôs preparing soldiers for battle: cooking eggs <i class="calibre5">·ªëp la</i>, <i
                            class="calibre5">c√† ph√™ s·ªØa ƒë√°</i>, and some leftover <i class="calibre5">b√°nh ∆∞·ªõt</i> from
                        the
                        restaurant. They‚Äôre talking about B·∫£o‚Äôs restaurant, especially their plans for later tonight.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">B√°nh X√®o</i> Day,‚Äù Ba remarks. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt we ever think
                        of
                        that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaking <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> was never my strong suit,‚Äù M·∫π says.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe you should practice,‚Äù Ba replies.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe <i class="calibre5">you</i> should,‚Äù she retorts, before turning her
                        attention to the saut√© pan, where another serving of over easy eggs is ready to be ipped. Evie
                        and I
                        grin at each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look down, realizing that my mom had set before me a bowl of <i
                            class="calibre5">ch√°o g√†</i>, warm rice porridge with chicken meat, freshly chopped parsley,
                        and
                        a few turns of ground pepper. My mom must have made it late last night at some point. A rush of
                        warmth washes over me, and I haven‚Äôt even taken a bite.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre12">She settles into her seat to my left. Ba‚Äôs at my right,
                        and
                        Evie‚Äôs across from me. The seating that we‚Äôd had as we shared countless dinners. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope
                        today
                        goes o as well as last time,‚Äù M·∫π says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I thread my fingers through hers. I hope so too, but I also would hate that to
                        mean
                        that B·∫£o‚Äôs family somehow fails, and maybe that makes me a traitor. I brush aside the thought,
                        focusing on my mom and the rest of my family.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 29</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The weather is dreary and gray, but it bodes well for tonight, my mom proclaims.
                        It
                        means rain is coming&mdash;the perfect excuse for <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">At home in our kitchen, my mom woke up early to prep. I shu e into the kitchen
                        in
                        my sweats, trying to compute what my eyes are seeing. On every surface available&mdash;the
                        table,
                        the counters, the top of our rice cooker&mdash;sit metal food buckets, each holding the food
                        items
                        that would go in each batch of <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>: shrimp, pork belly, bean
                        sprouts,
                        and more. I see another batter that‚Äôs not as yellow; it might be the desserts she‚Äôs trying out,
                        something that resembles a crepe, ready for xings of strawberry, Nutella, and banana.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π comes in from outside, raincoat on, her pj‚Äôs underneath. She shakes out her
                        wet
                        hair. From her morning shower or from outside, I‚Äôm not sure. Behind her on the outside stove,
                        whatever‚Äôs inside the pan sizzles and pops.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNeed help?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo touching,‚Äù M·∫π answers tersely. She tries to clean but all she‚Äôs really
                        doing is
                        moving from one bucket to the next. I haven‚Äôt seen her fretting like this since she found out
                        about
                        the Mais‚Äô rst Ph·ªü Day. And it all makes sense.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π, are you nervous?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNervous? M·∫π not nervous.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the Vietnamese word for ‚Äònervous‚Äô?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Lo l·∫Øng</i>, but M·∫π not <i class="calibre5">lo l·∫Øng</i>,‚Äù
                        my
                        mom counters. ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Ch·∫øt cha</i>.‚Äù She does a double take toward the outdoor
                        stove,
                        cursing when she sees something I can‚Äôt. I watch from inside as she scoops the batter from the
                        pan
                        and dumps it onto a plate&mdash;with other failed attempts, I guess.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π,‚Äù I say rmly once she gets back in. ‚ÄúWhat can I do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre12">M·∫π sighs and glances down at her bowl half full of
                        batter.
                        ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done a couple of batters. But something is not right. I‚Äôm about to put in another layer
                        right
                        now. Here, let‚Äôs use another pan. Everything else is almost cooked.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She lets the pan sit for a few seconds over the fire before instructing me to
                        douse
                        it with two bottle-squirts of oil. She adds shrimp and pork belly. After waiting a couple more
                        beats, using her chopsticks to mix the batter, she deftly pours in a thin layer and it slides
                        into
                        the pan with a satisfying sizzle.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tricky, getting the layer just right,‚Äù M·∫π says, adding in bean sprouts.
                        ‚ÄúToo
                        much and it won‚Äôt be crispy. <i class="calibre5">Kh√¥ng gi√≤n</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow do you know when it‚Äôs crispy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe edges look as if they want to peel off.‚Äù Seconds pass and she has her
                        spatula
                        ready. She folds the pancake in half, the other side golden brown. I grin. If she were in Chef
                        L√™‚Äôs
                        kitchen, he‚Äôd probably be praising her. <i class="calibre5">This is the shit</i>, he‚Äôd say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> slides off easily onto the plate that I‚Äôm
                        holding. The rain has let up, but water from the gutter drips by my feet. I‚Äôm about to head
                        inside
                        again to actually get a raincoat, when I hear M·∫π speaking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI used to love <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> as a child. During the monsoon
                        seasons. Your uncle and I would eat this up whenever our parents made them,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe would
                        leave the door open and watch the rain from the kitchen.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúC·∫≠u Cam?‚Äù The uncle who I resembled. The one who didn‚Äôt make it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhen I cook things like this, I remember him. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd be surprised by
                        how
                        good of a cook I‚Äôve become. He was always so critical of my skills,‚Äù she says fondly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">After a moment, realizing that‚Äôs all she‚Äôs going to say, I mention, ‚Äú<i
                            class="calibre5">Everyone</i> says your <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> is the best one,
                        you
                        know.‚Äù</p>

                        But
                        she smiles at me, her hood covering most of her face. I know her, though; I know she likes to
                        hear
                        praise like this. She glances up at the sky, watching for something I can‚Äôt see. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping the
                        rain doesn‚Äôt make everyone stay inside. If so, both restaurants might lose, which can‚Äôt be

                        But until then, we think this deal will get a lot of customers. Even more than <i

                        compare
                        to Linh‚Äôs, not at this hour, but still, there are people waiting outside the restaurant,
                        umbrellas
                        up. So far, no one looks upset that they‚Äôre in the rain. Ba walks down the line, handing out
                        menus
                        for consideration and even some samples of <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>. One guy takes a

                        and says, ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Dude</i>. This is the best thing I‚Äôve ever tasted. Even my mom
                        doesn‚Äôt make it this good.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I only saw the back of my dad‚Äôs head, so I have to imagine his reaction to
                        being
                        called a ‚Äúdude.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGame on, man,‚Äù Vi·ªát says, standing right next to me as he ties his apron
                        strings
                        behind his back. He was here earlier with us, his parents tagging along as they dropped off a
                        fresh
                        batch of shrimp for tonight‚Äôs service.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In the furry of everything, I remember that Vi·ªát doesn‚Äôt know about me and Linh

                        Vi·ªát everything about my visit to Linh in the art room, my note to her, and then our meetup at
                        Chef
                        L√™‚Äôs place and our decision to test out our relationship.</p>

                        anything for a few beats. Suddenly, he‚Äôs thumping me on the back&mdash;channeling Chef L√™‚Äôs
                        strength
                        &mdash;congratulating me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs no better way to test a relationship than competition.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThanks for the reminder, Vi·ªát.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúPersonally, I don‚Äôt think anyone can really win. Both restaurants are doing
                        different specials, so it‚Äôs going to draw different people. Don‚Äôt tell your mom I said this,
                        though. She
                        wouldn‚Äôt like it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWho wouldn‚Äôt like what?‚Äù M·∫π asks, appearing behind us as she dons a pair of
                        kitchen gloves. ‚ÄúWhy are you talking instead of working?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNothing, we‚Äôre just wondering if anyone‚Äôs ever going to make <i
                            class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> the way you do. What if the other restaurant tries to copy
                        us?‚Äù
                        Vi·ªát answers, so sweetly that M·∫π might see through him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π doesn‚Äôt even bat an eyelash as she says, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre no good at making <i
                            class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had theirs before or something?‚Äù I ask, surprised that she would know
                        how
                        it tasted. Or at least it sounds like it. She used to call their other foods bland, especially
                        the
                        ph·ªü, and I always thought it was an assumption on her part. A way to mock them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π waves her hand. ‚ÄúI just know it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Her quick answer bothers me, though. It‚Äôs more of a feeling than
                        anything.
                        But there isn‚Äôt time to think about it more, because Ba is shouting for us to get into formation
                        up
                        front and seat everyone he‚Äôs about to let in.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The deal started out as a combination special&mdash;ph·ªü plus a free mini
                        pancake. It
                        was going ne until the first ticket for one complete order of <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>
                        emerges, and then another, and then another. Soon enough, we find tables ordering <i
                            class="calibre5">only</i> pancakes and not ph·ªü.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The customers are mostly Vi·ªát, with a few stragglers who probably spotted a
                        flyer at a Vietnamese market.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre12">One woman&mdash;strikingly blond&mdash;with a hint of
                        some
                        European accent asks me to describe <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> to her. She‚Äôs in charge of
                        ordering for her family of ve who look the most out of place in the restaurant&mdash;and I‚Äôm
                        guessing Bolsa in general.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHave you ever had a crepe?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell this is kind of a like a crepe, except it‚Äôs mostly savory. Think about
                        the
                        crispiest thing you‚Äôve ever eaten. Got it?‚Äù The customer nods, looking like she‚Äôs hanging on to
                        my
                        every word. I feel suddenly powerful, and I go with this feeling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sitting outside under a storefront‚Äôs umbrella. It‚Äôs raining, but not
                        pouring, and you can smell soil, gasoline from a motorbike just passing through. Someone places
                        this
                        bright yellow pancake in front of you. It has turmeric, juicy pork belly, soft prawns, and
                        crunchy
                        bean sprouts tucked inside, and you drizzle salty and spicy fish sauce all over it. One bite‚Ä¶
                        and
                        you‚Äôre gone.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The customer blinks twice and sits back. ‚ÄúYou sold me. One for everyone at the
                        table.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt regret it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Back in the kitchen, I hand over my slip to M·∫π, who does a double take. ‚ÄúFive?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFive,‚Äù I repeat with a wide grin.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDid you tell them we put gold in it or something?‚Äù she mutters. I catch a hint
                        of
                        a smile as she turns back toward the kitchen line to bark an order.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Over the years, my parents have had to deal with various levels of nasty
                        customers.
                        Abhorrent. Unconscionable. Sometimes, the criticism comes from other Vietnamese people. The
                        broth‚Äôs
                        too bland or the egg rolls haven‚Äôt been cooked enough or the <i class="calibre5">n∆∞·ªõc m·∫Øm</i>
                        doesn‚Äôt have enough lime. M·∫π‚Äôs quick to have a word with them, her voice turning firm when she‚Äôs
                        speaking in her language. By the end, they always agree to disagree about the recipes.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre12">‚ÄúEvery Vietnamese person is different. Our family may be
                        different according to region.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But some customers are on a different level. Like today.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Around four in the afternoon, Vi·ªát comes up to me by the service window
                        looking,
                        for once, concerned.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up with you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDude, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Some guy‚Äôs saying we haven‚Äôt given him enough egg
                        rolls.‚Äù

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow many did he order?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOne side.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd we gave him two?‚Äù At Vi·ªát‚Äôs nod, I ask, ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the deal?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt believe me, thinks we‚Äôre scamming him. He wants to speak to the
                        manager.‚Äù I hesitate then. That would be my mom. It‚Äôs ne for my mom to berate Vietnamese
                        customers&mdash;somehow she manages to win them over by cracking a joke or two, then she gives
                        them
                        an extra side of something. But in English, she‚Äôs different. I can see it in her face when she
                        struggles to find the right word, the right retort. It‚Äôs one of her biggest insecurities. Then
                        she
                        loses her cool, getting angry mostly at herself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I search the room and nd the trouble immediately. His face is sunburned and he
                        has
                        his sunglasses on top of his head. His hair‚Äôs all spiked up. While he waits for attention, he
                        leans
                        back, arms crossed, fingers tapping away his impatience. It looks like he‚Äôs with his wife or
                        girlfriend and their kids. The woman‚Äôs leaning in, whispering something, but he just stares
                        straight
                        ahead, jaw clenched. I wonder how the kids must be feeling.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π makes her way from the front desk to the table&mdash;and steps back when the
                        man
                        rises slowly. He towers over her in a way that reminds me that my mom‚Äôs actually under five
                        feet. It‚Äôs
                        always her voice and manner that make her seem taller than she is.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShit. I have a bad feeling about this.‚Äù Vi·ªát and I get closer to the table.

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúA scam?‚Äù M·∫π asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat, that word not clicking for you? Do you even know English?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat the fuck, man,‚Äù Vi·ªát whispers to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMister,‚Äù M·∫π starts over, regulating her voice. She speaks slowly, but clearly,
                        ‚ÄúWe

                    <p class="calibre12">She gestures to other tables, where customers have stopped eating or are trying
                        not
                        to look interested in the drama. The man can‚Äôt help but look around too, and he lets his arms
                        fall
                        loose. From my place, I breathe out. There. It‚Äôs just a misunderstanding. He‚Äôs going to
                        apologize
                        soon, and then everything will go okay.</p>

                        now.
                        ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not paying for this,‚Äù Jared declares.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat&mdash;‚Äù My mom‚Äôs sputtering now, shocked by his declaration. As am I.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Before another word can be said, the guy forcefully pushes his chair in and
                        barks
                        at his children to get up too, which they do, eyes on the ground. Embarrassed, maybe. I would
                        be.
                        The little girl looks close to tears, even. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I jump in. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not cool, man. You already
                        ate, like, everything.‚Äù Which is true. The ph·ªü, the <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i>&mdash;save
                        for
                        the side order of egg rolls&mdash;are all cleared. But my protest goes unheard. Beth scrabbles
                        for
                        her purse hanging on her chair and almost hesitates to follow Jared. Mouth opening, then
                        closing,
                        she finally heads toward the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm the first to move. ‚ÄúWhat the hell!‚Äù I try moving past my mom, planning on
                        calling
                        the police on them, or <i class="calibre5">something</i> that would make them pay, but M·∫π
                        quickly
                        catches me by the wrist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCon, it‚Äôs not worth it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm shaking with anger. ‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe have to get back to work.‚Äù M·∫π gives me a hard look. ‚ÄúThere are other
                        customers
                        to take care of. This family won‚Äôt make a difference.‚Äù To the remaining customers, she turns and
                        smiles diplomatically. ‚ÄúPlease, return to your meals. Sorry for the disturbance.‚Äù She repeats it
                        in
                        Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre12">My mom saves her complaints about Jared and his family
                        for
                        the kitchen. I‚Äôm sure this has happened before but it was the first time I‚Äôd seen it in person.
                        I grew
                        up here, living around people who looked like me. We belonged to the same temple, our parents
                        knew
                        each other. I didn‚Äôt expect to see someone from the outside look so sure of themselves as they
                        spouted hate.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I lean forward, elbows on a prep table, and say, ‚ÄúDo you think that guy‚Äôs going
                        to
                        come back?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, I won‚Äôt let him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you report him?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs many men like him. Are we going to report all of them?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, but‚Ä¶‚Äù I trail o ; I don‚Äôt have a real solution. I guess I just don‚Äôt
                        like
                        the feeling of some guy treating my parents&mdash;and other owners in the area&mdash;like this.
                        It
                        was more painful than hearing the waiter at photastic ask my dad to repeat himself. This guy
                        basically attacked them. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it just seems wrong.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe are not new to this,‚Äù Ba says shortly. ‚ÄúWe have lived in other places

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt come back, con. <i class="calibre5">ƒê·ªì qu·ª∑</i>.‚Äù Somehow she makes
                        swear
                        words sound like a natural part of our language.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an asshole,‚Äù I agree. Now she scolds me for using a bad word, but I press
                        on.

                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">My phone chirps. A text from B·∫£o. My parents are finally sitting down with
                        friends
                        who‚Äôd stopped by at the tail end of service hours. The men brought out Heineken, signaling that
                        it‚Äôll be a bit longer until we get to leave the restaurant. Evie is busy with cleanup tasks,
                        though
                        from what I can see, she‚Äôs catching up with the line cooks who looked after us when we were
                        younger,
                        and the less senior servers are taking care of clearing the tables. I sneak out, promising
                        myself
                        ten minutes of my own time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The air is cool enough for me to wear my jacket outside. I use the lamplights
                        to
                        guide me away from the restaurant, to the small park usually populated by skateboarders and
                        people
                        exercising outside. B·∫£o‚Äôs there, sitting on a graffiti-ridden bench. He sets a Styrofoam
                        container on
                        the bench and stands when he sees me. His smile is weary, a perfect reflection of mine. He
                        kisses me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúPeace offering,‚Äù he says, handing me a container. I laugh and hand him my own,
                        which I had hidden behind my back. Inside B·∫£o‚Äôs box, he‚Äôd packed away a small slice of <i
                            class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o,</i> while I gave him egg rolls nicked from the kitchen. We sit
                        there,
                        eating food cooked by our family‚Äôs respective enemy. I wish I could say I understood why their
                        food
                        is considered a threat, a reason for my dad‚Äôs competitiveness when it comes to them, but I can‚Äôt
                        really taste the difference, even if the <i class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> is good.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs possible that our parents actually know each other?‚Äù B·∫£o
                        asks.
                        ‚ÄúLike, actually interacted with each other? Maybe way before us. Vietnam, or sometime after
                        their
                        escapes?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt they have said something, though?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre12">‚ÄúCome on, it wouldn‚Äôt be unusual for them to hold back a
                        few
                        things from us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I think about the comments my mom and dad have made about his family. <i
                            class="calibre5">Have I missed signs?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat makes you say that?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy mom mentioned something about your mom‚Äôs cooking. About her <i
                            class="calibre5">b√°nh x√®o</i> not being good, but she sounded like she <i
                            class="calibre5">knew.</i> Like she‚Äôs had it before.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ ?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow much do we really know? Like Chef L√™ said, there‚Äôs stu that they don‚Äôt
                        tell us
                        because it isn‚Äôt relevant to us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo, what, you want to ask your parents about us?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNothing too direct. Nothing to raise suspicion. You okay?‚Äù Hands together, he
                        runs
                        his thumb over my hand. I wonder if he knows what he‚Äôs doing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot, I know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt want to run away again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù I say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy mom just texted. She‚Äôs wondering where I‚Äôve gone off to; they‚Äôre heading
                        home.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I sigh. I hate thinking that the moments we spend together are only
                        temporary. That, when we get back to our separate restaurants, we‚Äôll need to pretend that our
                        lives
                        have no bearing on each other. When it‚Äôs the opposite.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He takes my hand and we start walking back. I imagine a time when we don‚Äôt have
                        to
                        hold hands in the dark, when we can visit each other on lunch breaks without having to nd a
                        secluded
                        park.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find another moment,‚Äù B·∫£o says, reading my expression. ‚ÄúWe still haven‚Äôt
                        had a
                        first date yet.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIf you think about it, haven‚Äôt we‚Äôve gone on many dates already&mdash;between
                        the
                        restaurants that we went to and our meetings in the art room?‚Äù I say, even though the word
                        ‚Äúdate‚Äù
                        causes my stomach to tumble.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We stand at the intersection between Larkin and Sylvester, knowing we‚Äôll need
                        to
                        let go. By day, the plaza is packed with cars, but the parking lot is empty now. A neon sign
                        saying
                        <span class="calibre13">CLOSED</span> burns brightly in the dark, casting a metallic sheen
                        against
                        B·∫£o‚Äôs face. It‚Äôs silent save for grasshoppers hiding in nearby bushes.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre12">‚ÄúThis is going to be different. Let‚Äôs go somewhere where
                        I can
                        hold your hand like this.‚Äù He squeezes my hand. ‚ÄúBrush aside your hair when it falls in front of
                        your eyes.‚Äù Like now. ‚ÄúKiss you.‚Äù He leans in, capturing my lips.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOur first date will be ours alone,‚Äù he declares.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">On a Saturday, my parents and I attend a two-part wedding: the traditional
                        Vietnamese ceremony and the American reception&mdash;all in one day. The bride, Fay, is the
                        oldest
                        granddaughter of B√°c Xu√¢n. I‚Äôve talked to Fay a couple of times, our circles of family and
                        friends
                        overlapping because of our business, and liked her. Rather than being involved in the food
                        business,
                        she went to dental school and later opened up her own practice in southern California. Her
                        partner
                        is her soon-to-be husband.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Attending a wedding ceremony means I‚Äôll need to squeeze into my <i
                            class="calibre5">√°o d√†i</i>, which grows tighter each passing year. It means seeing
                        strangers
                        who know everything about me through information shared over various phone calls, store errands,
                        and
                        house get-togethers. It also means there‚Äôs a high possibility of me sitting at the kids‚Äô tables
                        at
                        the reception&mdash;with the actual ages ranging from two to college students. Since Evie‚Äôs back
                        at
                        college, I‚Äôll be the only teenager at the table, but for the rst time ever, it won‚Äôt matter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This wedding is an opportunity.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mind latched on to B·∫£o‚Äôs suggestion as I fell asleep last night. Is it
                        possible
                        that there‚Äôs more to our families‚Äô feud besides our competitive restaurants? Is there something
                        else
                        that might have driven them apart and made our families this way?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I can‚Äôt ask my parents outright; I‚Äôm not even sure there‚Äôs a way to ask them
                        subtly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But, as all Vietnamese know, information gets around. At least one person has
                        to
                        know the truth. In my parents‚Äô network, there‚Äôs only one viable person who might know more about
                        my
                        family&mdash;and B·∫£o‚Äôs. The best connection that we have so far is B√°c Xu√¢n, Fay‚Äôs grandfather,
                        who
                        gave my mom a chance with the restaurant. And who helped most of the businesses around here,
                        including B·∫£o‚Äôs family restaurant.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-197" class="calibre12">M·∫π and I are getting ready in her bedroom. She‚Äôs just put
                        on
                        her <i class="calibre5">√°o d√†i</i>, a yellow-and-white oral pattern adorning it from top to
                        bottom.
                        She needs me to hook together the sides so that skin there doesn‚Äôt show.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Apparently Fay and her husband are not going to last, my mom con des in me.
                        They‚Äôd
                        picked the wrong dates, didn‚Äôt consult the right calendar, or something like that. I don‚Äôt think
                        those things actually have a real bearing on the outcome of their marriage, but my mom&mdash;and
                        her
                        friends&mdash;certainly do.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The ceremony at Fay‚Äôs house proceeds smoothly. First the men and the women from
                        each side of the family exchange gifts in red tin baskets covered by red velvet. It‚Äôs a way of
                        the
                        husband asking permission from the bride‚Äôs family to see her. Both families line up at the
                        shrine,
                        also decorated in red. Fay, radiant in her traditional red <i class="calibre5">√°o d√†i</i>,
                        emerges
                        from upstairs, her arm looped through her already crying mother‚Äôs. When she joins her soon-to-be
                        husband, D≈©ng, who‚Äôs wearing the traditional blue <i class="calibre5">√°o d√†i</i> for men, the
                        image
                        of them is striking. They‚Äôre the most colorful people in the room, and their happiness only
                        makes
                        them glow brighter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I imagine the murmurs from the crowd fade when Fay and D≈©ng face each other to
                        exchange vows. D≈©ng, so nervous, bumbles his way through his speech, his words earnest and
                        sincere,
                        and Fay reaches out for his hand when he pauses, holding back tears. We‚Äôre all smiling by the
                        end of
                        the ceremony.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Later, the wedding transitions into a modern American wedding. The <i
                            class="calibre5">√°o d√†i</i> disappear&mdash;though Fay‚Äôs mom opts out of changing&mdash;and
                        we
                        move for the American ceremony to a Catholic church, the reception to follow in its courtyard
                        right
                        after. I‚Äôve changed into a periwinkle dress that stops above my knees.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I do my best to avoid the women in Fay‚Äôs family. They like to tease. They
                        think, <i class="calibre5">Well, there‚Äôs one Vietnamese woman off the market! Let‚Äôs see who else
                            has
                            potential</i>, so they crowd the young ones and joke about their boyfriends. I can just
                        imagine
                        the fury on my parents‚Äô faces if I were to ever answer the question honestly. That me and B·∫£o
                        are
                        finally together.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre12">I try to fight back my smile when I get the question for
                        the
                        fourth time tonight. I guess it feels less tedious when you actually have a perfect answer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Fay and her husband, D≈©ng, couldn‚Äôt look any happier. Probably both from the
                        relief
                        of finally seeing their wedding go o without a hitch and from the actual idea that they‚Äôre just
                        starting a new life together.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">By now, food and lots of alcohol have sated the guests. The elderly ones sit
                        clumped off, chattering away about past and present grievances. My parents are sitting with
                        Fay‚Äôs
                        parents, chatting. The younger generation are tearing up the floor, moving along to the American
                        music blasting from the speakers. They‚Äôre</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">heedless of the expressions of shock, and some amusement, from their parents and
                        family members watching. But there‚Äôs also a few braver older Vietnamese guests who‚Äôve joined the
                        oor, and I think I can pass the night away just watching it happen. The strobe lights are
                        blinding,
                        disorienting. I almost forget about B√°c Xu√¢n, until I see him a couple tables away, seated in a
                        wheelchair on the edge of the dance oor. My heart wrings at the sight of him; it‚Äôs been so many
                        years since I‚Äôve seen him in person.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I escape the flailing elbow of a seven-year-old to my right and make my way
                        over. ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Th∆∞a</i>, B√°c Xu√¢n.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B√°c Xu√¢n looks up slowly and reveals a nearly toothless smile. ‚ÄúAh, <i
                            class="calibre5">ch√°u</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you remember me?‚Äù I ask cautiously in Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course. Li√™n Ph·∫°m‚Äôs daughter,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúYou look just like her now.
                        What a
                        beautiful young woman you‚Äôve become.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I laugh, sitting down across from him. Age spots outline his cheek. His hands
                        sandwich mine, trembling faintly. There‚Äôs a glossiness in his eyes that I mostly see in my
                        family‚Äôs
                        elderly customers. They‚Äôre past the point of worrying, their lives already fulfilled. I think
                        it‚Äôs a
                        look of satisfaction, or I hope it is.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow are you doing? What are you doing in school? And where is your sister
                        &mdash;you have a sister, don‚Äôt you? I remember she was very smart. And you still draw?‚Äù He
                        seems
                        happy to talk to someone, finally. I smile with relief, just glad that he remembers me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúEvie‚Äôs away at UC Davis, studying biology.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAh!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd I still draw. I‚Äôm a painter, in fact.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo I can see.‚Äù He gestures to my hands. I really thought
                        I
                        washed them well, but I missed a spot on my pinkie finger. <i class="calibre5">‚ÄúGi·ªëng y h·ªát d√¨
                            c·ªßa
                            ch√°u,‚Äù</i> he mutters, amused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy aunt?‚Äù I ask in English, jostled by the comparison. Then I remember she
                        visited
                        him when she was over here. ‚ÄúD√¨ V√†ng, you mean.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course. Ever since she was little, she would have her hands in something
                        messy.
                        Mud. Then clay. Sculpting was her true passion.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The disorientation comes back and now it has nothing to do with the lights.
                        ‚ÄúYou
                        knew my mom and aunt back in Vietnam?‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">I lean back into my seat. That‚Äôs why my aunt had been so familiar with him on
                        her
                        last visit. They weren‚Äôt just meeting; they were <i class="calibre5">reuniting</i>. I glance
                        past
                        B√°c Xu√¢n, feeling as if the ground shifted underneath me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Back in Nha Trang. <i class="calibre5">Before me.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">B·∫£o‚Äôs right. There‚Äôs more to the story than we‚Äôve been

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, your mother and your aunt! They were inseparable, especially after your
                        grandparents passed. It was always interesting seeing your mother act like the older sister.‚Äù
                        B√°c
                        Xu√¢n shifts in his wheelchair, his pillow slipping sideways. I get up and x it quickly, earning
                        a
                        pat on the shoulder. ‚ÄúThank you. The community, just like here, was important in our
                        neighborhood.
                        Individually we didn‚Äôt have much, but together, we had everything we would need, even as the <i
                            class="calibre5">C·ªông s·∫£n</i> were starting to take everything we had. We looked out for
                        each
                        other. M·∫π, your mother and aunt, the L√™s, especially after the fall of Saigon.‚Äù He pauses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAh, forgive me. She‚Äôs no longer a L√™; she‚Äôs now a Nguy·ªÖn.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Nguy·ªÖn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt was a miracle that we all found each other again when we made it over here.
                        It
                        took longer than we all imagined.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Nguy·ªÖn as in B·∫£o Nguy·ªÖn?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB√°c Xu√¢n,‚Äù I say, interrupting him midsentence, ‚Äúby Nguy·ªÖn and by ‚Äòshe,‚Äô do
                        you
                        mean the woman who owns the restaurant across from ours?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course, who else? She runs her restaurant like a true entrepreneur. Just
                        like
                        her own mother. I thought that by encouraging her and your mother to see each other
                        again&mdash;the
                        restaurants facing each other&mdash;they would be able to move on from the past.‚Äù He shakes his
                        head. ‚ÄúAh, terrible what happened.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-200" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I ask immediately, though I wish I
                        hadn‚Äôt,
                        because it signals a change in B√°c‚Äôs expression. He actually looks uncomfortable now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shake my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAh, well. It is not my story to tell. If my wife were here‚Äù&mdash;B√°c Xu√¢n‚Äôs
                        wife
                        had passed before I remember meeting him&mdash;‚Äúshe would tell you everything, but I don‚Äôt think
                        I
                        can. I don‚Äôt think I have any right to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI won‚Äôt tell my parents, I swear. I‚Äôve been wondering about the other family,
                        why
                        they‚Äôve never spoken to each other. Why they seem to hate each other.‚Äù I place a hand on his
                        arm,
                        but he only pats it again, this time with sympathy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He chews on his lip, deep in con ict. ‚ÄúWe went through many things to get here,
                        <i class="calibre5">ch√°u</i>. Things that we do not speak of because it might pain us too much.
                        Show some respect. It will all come out in due time.‚Äù He nods to another person over my
                        shoulder,
                        then wheels himself away, oblivious to the thoughts roiling inside me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I stalk the room, deep in thought, the wedding fading in the background. My mom
                        and
                        Ba have now included B√°c in their conversation with Fay‚Äôs parents. M·∫π is smiling and Ba throws
                        back
                        his head, laughing. They‚Äôre both red from the wine at the table. Looking at the group, I
                        wouldn‚Äôt
                        have been able to see the shared history with B√°c; I always assumed they‚Äôd met in California.
                        But
                        there‚Äôs a story between them&mdash;and between my mom and B·∫£o‚Äôs mom.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The bride and groom do their rounds around the room, trailed by a red-eyed,
                        pale
                        photographer who looks like he doesn‚Äôt know what sleeping means. When they get to my table,
                        where
                        I‚Äôm now sitting, the kids all hold up their fourth glasses of soda that their parents, under the
                        dim
                        lighting, and amid the noise of celebration, don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre having.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Fay spots me and gives me a quick hug. I push the revelation from B√°c Xu√¢n to
                        the
                        back of my mind. She introduces me to D≈©ng. Up close, dressed in a chic white dress and crisp
                        black-and-white suit, they really do look like models.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you guys meet?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">At my question, Fay and D≈©ng exchange one look and a small smile, full of
                        meaning,
                        full of secrets only the two of them can know. ‚ÄúWell, we were in college and in the library
                        cramming
                        like usual.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt was the rst time I stepped into the library, actually,‚Äù D≈©ng jokes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe checked out books at the same time. Mine was a chemistry book.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">D≈©ng glances down in mock shame. ‚ÄúAnd mine was a manga book.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSomething I‚Äôll never stop teasing you about.‚Äù Her husband pulls her close,
                        planting a quick kiss on her forehead.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOur first date, because we were poor college students, was actually on
                        campus.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">First date</i>. B·∫£o said we‚Äôd have one soon, but will that
                        all
                        change when I tell him what I‚Äôve found out? That the history between our families goes even
                        further
                        back than we realized, to a time that neither of us belonged to?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Turns out D≈©ng had been the one to ask her out first. ‚ÄúWe had a picnic on the
                        quad,
                        then walked around campus, ended up at the library, where I made dinner in one of the study
                        rooms.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Fay gazes up at D≈©ng with a soft smile, so tender I feel like I‚Äôm intruding.
                        ‚ÄúAnd
                        did your parents approve of you two?‚Äù Then, the DJ decides to turn up the music, drowning out
                        most,
                        if not all, of my question. In Vietnamese, he asks if everyone is having fun.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Fay leans over, asking me to repeat myself. The photographer snaps a photo of
                        us. I
                        shake my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThis wedding is so much fun. Congrats!‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 31</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I die. Again and again and again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù I say, throwing Vi·ªát‚Äôs console to the ground. I‚Äôve played <i
                            class="calibre5">Apex</i> before, but not as badly, but I guess that‚Äôs what happens when my
                        mind
                        isn‚Äôt on the game. Instead, it‚Äôs on a certain painter, and that date I was so confident to
                        suggest.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre at Vi·ªát‚Äôs house on our day o from work. Vi·ªát is ensconced in his beanbag
                        chair, looking like he was browsing the Internet rather than systematically destroying me and my
                        team. ‚ÄúYou suck more than usual,‚Äù he says oh-so-observantly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThanks. Sorry, let‚Äôs try it again.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, whatever you say.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I haven‚Äôt had a chance to see Linh, only text her. She said the wedding had
                        gone
                        okay, and that she needed to tell me something, though it might be important since she didn‚Äôt
                        text
                        me what the thing was, just that she‚Äôd see me soon. A small part of me wonders if she‚Äôs
                        regretting
                        everything that happened&mdash; if I‚Äôm putting more hope into a relationship that can‚Äôt work
                        out.
                        But that kiss Linh had given me, the texts since then&mdash;and the promise that we would see
                        each
                        other&mdash;made it sound like she was in this, all the way. What did she need to talk to me
                        about?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When I think of romance and dating, my mind plays out the South Korean dramas
                        that
                        get M·∫π giddy: You know, the kind with the impossibly good-looking guy and the impossibly
                        good-looking girl who‚Äôs disguised as an awkward person. Cue scenes with intermittent slow-motion
                        physical contact, gauzy romantic music. Then they somehow end up trapped in an elevator and fall
                        asleep slumped together. These things don‚Äôt happen in real life.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre12">I never thought that I‚Äôd be staying up late reading <i
                            class="calibre5">Seventeen</i> and <i class="calibre5">Marie Claire</i> articles on first
                        date
                        ideas. I never thought I‚Äôd be reading those magazines, period. So far, the options are boring
                        and
                        generic, but I keep trying because my other option is to ask the person who knows Linh best for
                        ideas and that‚Äôs Ali, and I don‚Äôt want to go there.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">One thing that‚Äôs consistent in the articles is that dates should be activities
                        that
                        two people would want to do together. We‚Äôve done the restaurant thing. Movies could work, but
                        we‚Äôve
                        already had six years of silence, once I think about it, so that‚Äôs o the list. I thought of
                        Ph∆∞·ªõc
                        L·ªôc Th·ªç, but a local mall crawling with people who know either set of parents would make us
                        paranoid
                        the whole time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I am so desperate for an idea that I consult Vi·ªát in between games.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">All I get is a blank stare.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut you watch <i class="calibre5">The Bachelor</i>!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI do. But his dates actually suck!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Not helpful.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The next day, I resolve to find another source: Chef L√™‚Äôs place, which is just
                        starting to switch from late afternoon to dinner service. It works out well, since it‚Äôs the same
                        day
                        Linh has resolved to submit her paintings to the Gold Keys; she just needs to choose between her
                        final
                        pieces.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh disappears into the back to grab a fresh paint mixer, and that‚Äôs when I
                        bring
                        up the whole date issue.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFirst date?‚Äù Chef L√™ shouts across the room at Saffron. ‚ÄúBabe, they‚Äôre going
                        on
                        their first date!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI heard you; you don‚Äôt need to shout,‚Äù she sings back to him, joining us at
                        the
                        center with a sparkling water with lemon in hand.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo what, B·∫£o, you need some tips?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, kind of.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre12">Saffron says, ‚ÄúAny date you think of will be fine. As
                        long as
                        you don‚Äôt do what Bry did.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His head swivels in her direction. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that? Mine was the
                        pinnacle
                        of romantic dates.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou took me to the Eiffel Tower.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ohhhh. But Chef L√™ is less than quick to get it, apparently. ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs
                        beautiful.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHoney, I‚Äôm French. Seeing the Tower is like Americans visiting Washington,
                        DC.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ leans forward now, elbows on the table. ‚ÄúSo what made you want to go
                        out
                        with me again?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Amused, Saffron takes a sip of her sparkling water. ‚ÄúI guess it was the day we
                        went
                        shopping. Which we didn‚Äôt really call a date, but it was one.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúTo buy the floor lamp for your apartment? Going <i
                            class="calibre5">shopping</i> was
                        what convinced you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI thought it was sweet that you decided to go somewhere that you had zero
                        interest
                        in just because I said I wanted to go. I‚Äôm not about big gestures. So when you volunteered to
                        come
                        with me, I loved you even more.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo if I took you to the bridge with all those locks, we wouldn‚Äôt have ended up
                        together?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI would have left you right away.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRegular comedian today, aren‚Äôt you,‚Äù Chef L√™ grumbles before disappearing into
                        the
                        kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Saffron winks at me and with laughter still in her voice, says, ‚ÄúIt was
                        actually
                        three dates before I decided I liked him. But don‚Äôt let him know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I grin, thinking back to what Saffron just said. It wasn‚Äôt the date‚Äôs
                        destination
                        that really mattered to her; it was the gesture. She seemed to appreciate something less
                        extravagant, as long as it felt real.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">At that exact moment, Linh comes back, mixer in hand. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let him know
                        what?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Sa ron and I pipe back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000029.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-205" class="calibre1">An hour later, an idea catches on. I‚Äôm sitting down, my
                        back
                        pressed against the heaters emitting air that‚Äôs neither hot nor cold. Seeing that I had nothing
                        to
                        do, Chef L√™ asked if I could look over his brief speech. As comfortable as I‚Äôve grown with
                        writing,
                        it‚Äôs still a shock that someone would trust me with their writing like this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Hell, I still can‚Äôt believe <i class="calibre5">Ali</i> put some semblance of
                        trust
                        in me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">After journalism class today, Ali updated me about Ernie, who handed over his
                        first
                        television review about a <i class="calibre5">Black Mirror</i> episode. It was like another
                        person
                        had penned it. The writing was strong, energetic, and went deeper into the narrative than I‚Äôd
                        ever
                        be capable of doing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now, Linh is just a few feet away, wearing her usual paint gear, nestled
                        comfortably on the top of a ladder as she outlines parts of the mural with chalk.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She has a sketch clipped to her mini canvas and every minute or so, she squints
                        at
                        it, then stares hard at the mural. As if she‚Äôs imprinting the image with her mind. Not for the
                        rst
                        time, I‚Äôm not in her orbit anymore.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">If I walk out, will she even notice?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I set down my laptop and stand, fighting back a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôll go blind if you squint that much.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou sound like my mom.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm channeling mine.‚Äù I grin once I‚Äôm by the mural.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Shut up</i>,‚Äù Linh answers, refusing to look at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I wish I could lean up, steal a kiss. It‚Äôs been a few minutes since our last.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB·∫£o,‚Äù she says, still focused on her design. ‚ÄúI can feel you. You‚Äôre
                        hovering.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ making sure the ladder‚Äôs secure.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh rolls her eyes at me, then shakes her head so that her ponytail slides off
                        her
                        shoulder, back to a free hang.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat photo do you have?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called reference photo. Chef L√™ gave it to me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I know I should let her concentrate. And that she needs to get this mural done.
                        But
                        I also can‚Äôt wait to ask my question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I clear my throat. ‚ÄúSo are you&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt gured out a way&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre12">We stare at each other, laughing nervously as we talk
                        over
                        each other‚Äôs sentences.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, you go. You haven‚Äôt figured out a way to‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAt the wedding, I ran into B√°c Xu√¢n, who gave us the restaurant. And he
                        actually
                        knew my mom before they ever lived here. He knew her back in Vietnam.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I blink at her sudden statement.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh blows out air. ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">And</i> that‚Äôs not the only person he
                        knows.‚Äù She gazes down at me. ‚ÄúHe also knows your mom from Vietnam.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù I say. I sit down by the foot of the ladder. Linh eventually comes
                        down,
                        gesturing for me to scoot over as she sits right next to me. I think the air circulation has
                        somehow
                        gotten cut off , because suddenly I‚Äôm dizzy and barely feel the surface beneath me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh goes on, maybe too lost in her own thoughts to notice my reaction. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm
                        starting to think that this feud goes way back&mdash;before we were alive. It happened back <i
                            class="calibre5">there</i>, and it must have been bad if our moms aren‚Äôt talking to this
                        day.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd you don‚Äôt know what caused it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh nods and shrugs at the same time. ‚ÄúB√°c Xu√¢n wouldn‚Äôt say another word. He
                        said
                        it‚Äôs not his story to tell.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh tells me what B√°c said about their neighborhood being close, how they all
                        helped each other in need. Almost as if they‚Äôd become a family. So whatever happened between
                        them
                        had to be capable of breaking apart a family. Based on gossip from my mom‚Äôs circle, that could
                        be
                        anything. They‚Äôd mentioned a family whose youngest son had gotten into drugs, which got him
                        banned
                        from ever entering his childhood home. A man who was sixty years old went back to Vietnam to
                        find a
                        wife half his age, leaving his ex-wife and two kids to basically fend for themselves. The wrongs
                        done to the family seemed limitless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôre getting somewhere,‚Äù I say numbly. We are, but what if we
                        eventually nd
                        something that‚Äôs bigger than we ever imagined? What if it turns out it‚Äôs nothing we can ever
                        fix? What
                        would that do to our families? To me and Linh?</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre12">Linh slips her hand into mine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here, you know.
                        Nothing‚Äôs changing the way I feel about you. Whatever we find out, we‚Äôll find out together.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 32</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">B·∫£o kisses my hand, making me blush. Obviously the fact that our parents had
                        known
                        each other in Vietnam scared him, just as it scared me, and yet he‚Äôs still here. Holding my
                        hand.
                        Our break is interrupted by Chef L√™. He‚Äôs been so grateful that I‚Äôm taking on his mural, that in
                        addition to paying me commission later on, he‚Äôs been feeding us whenever we come by. He‚Äôs also
                        calling me ‚ÄúMiss Mai‚Äù&mdash;and B·∫£o likes it so much that he teases me whenever we‚Äôre alone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYo, you two are like an old married couple,‚Äù Chef L√™‚Äôs voice booms across the
                        room. He‚Äôs carrying two plates of <i class="calibre5">b√°nh cam</i> over to us, a towel slung
                        over
                        one shoulder. Even if I didn‚Äôt see him walk over, I would have smelled it: thick, glutinous rice
                        balls fried till crispy, with sugary mung bean nested within&mdash;a soft surprise once you bite
                        through the outside.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Chef L√™ has a big, smug grin plastered on his face. ‚ÄúTime for a break.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I try to turn it down; it‚Äôs the polite way as my parents taught me. ‚ÄúNo, I have
                        to
                        finish this sketch for the mural.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe mural can wait a few minutes. I‚Äôm not going to have someone faint on the
                        job.
                        Come here.‚Äù B·∫£o shoots me a grin and heaves himself off the oor, going to reach for one sesame
                        ball.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His phone, though, rings at the wrong moment. He grimaces at me. ‚ÄúMy mom.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBetter pick that up before your mom calls again,‚Äù Chef L√™ says seriously,
                        perhaps
                        remembering his own experience with his parents at our age.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o presses Accept. ‚ÄúHi, M·∫π‚Ä¶ Uh, yeah, I‚Äôm with Vi·ªát, just shopping.‚Äù Which is
                        half
                        true. Vi·ªát‚Äôs out shopping, just with his track friends, I‚Äôm told. B·∫£o glances at me before
                        turning
                        away, still talking to his mom. Apparently he needs to run to the store to get something.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you two not supposed to be here?‚Äù Chef L√™ asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúKind of. I‚Äôm not supposed to be here with <i class="calibre5">him.</i>‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd he do?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNothing. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ complicated. Our families hate each other. Restaurant
                        rivalry.‚Äù At one point, that had been accurate. But now‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo shit. That‚Äôs rough. So I don‚Äôt imagine you have a lot of chances to hang
                        out.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been finding time to steal. Sometimes at school and after school. And
                        here.
                        And we‚Äôre going on a date soon, I think.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Or I know, since Ali texted me earlier saying that she had a ‚Äútalk‚Äù with Vi·ªát,
                        who
                        apparently told Ali that B·∫£o was doing research.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFirst date, that‚Äôs big. But he hasn‚Äôt asked yet?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI think he was about to.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI can remind him.‚Äù Chef L√™ nudges me by the shoulder. If I had a brother, I
                        think
                        he‚Äôd be like him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat are you going on about?‚Äù B·∫£o asks, pocketing his phone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, you know. Deep emotional stuff,‚Äù Chef L√™ says casually.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A harried line cook surfaces from the kitchen, yelling Chef L√™‚Äôs name with
                        equal
                        parts annoyance and authority. Her hair has reached maximum frizz capacity. It‚Äôs obvious this
                        isn‚Äôt
                        a new thing&mdash;Chef L√™ wandering during duty when he‚Äôs really supposed to be manning the
                        kitchen.
                        He wouldn‚Äôt last a day in my mom‚Äôs kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOops, I guess I have to go back there.‚Äù He heaves himself to his feet and
                        slings
                        the towel back onto his shoulder. ‚ÄúNow eat before the sesame balls get cold.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHere you go, Miss Mai,‚Äù B·∫£o says, handing me one. It‚Äôs still warm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Nguy·ªÖn.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I grin, loving his sudden shyness. For a wordsmith, he clearly doesn‚Äôt have the
                        right ones lined up now. So I answer for him, put him out of his misery.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go on a date.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGood, because I have an idea.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-210" class="calibre4"><img src="images/000030.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" />
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">In a modern art class in freshman or sophomore year, we looked at a Van Gogh
                        painting from his time spent at Arles. He was always a tragic figure, someone who went through
                        so much
                        difficulty, only to receive fame years after his death.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He‚Äôd capture a simple rendition of his room: his bed, two empty chairs,
                        portraits
                        of unnamed subjects that seemed to stare right at the bed where he would usually go to sleep. As
                        if
                        his world had turned inward. As if there was nothing outside for him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Van Gogh‚Äôs room is my mom‚Äôs kitchen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">After my shift, right before we start to lock down, I find my mom alone in the
                        kitchen, stirring a ladle in a large pot. She‚Äôs not committed to it, just turning the spoon,
                        slowly
                        and slowly. Something must be bothering her, just as B√°c Xu√¢n‚Äôs statement has been bothering me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up. How can I even start a conversation and
                        transition
                        it smoothly over to the past&mdash;a past that my mom seems to volunteer to talk about less and
                        less? What right do I have to bring something up that may be painful to her?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Let it go. It will all come out in due time</i>, B√°c Xu√¢n
                        said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Will it be too late then?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π comes back to life; she picks up her stirring, then takes a sip. After
                        adding a
                        handful of sugar, she turns, jumping at the sight of me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou scared me, con.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I nally said. ‚ÄúWhat were you thinking about?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúD√¨ V√†ng. She‚Äôs coming very soon. I wonder if I‚Äôll have everything ready by
                        then.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you excited?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course. She‚Äôs my sister. It‚Äôs been far too long.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">This is an opening. I should ask, shouldn‚Äôt I?</i> But
                        perhaps
                        it‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs mood, perhaps it‚Äôs the feeling that I‚Äôm trespassing somewhere, but I keep the
                        question
                        to myself. I‚Äôll ask next time.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I will.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000031.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-211" class="calibre1">I‚Äôm in the art room after school the next day. I don‚Äôt
                        have to
                        work today, so I‚Äôm taking the extra time to just paint. Paint without needing to worry about
                        what to
                        submit since I did it right after stopping at Chef L√™‚Äôs. I know I chose the right paintings in
                        the
                        end, the ones that mattered the most to me and best represented the theme I was capturing:
                        memories.
                        Memories about my parents and growing up. About my journey as an artist. About B·∫£o and the
                        discoveries I‚Äôm making as we have more time to ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I only stop painting when Yamamoto comes in, announcing her appearance with a
                        dumbfounded, ‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù I turn on my stool, facing Yamamoto, who‚Äôs behind me, and wait for an
                        explanation.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But it doesn‚Äôt come, not right away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat are you thinking about?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. Your colors are the same, but something about this is‚Ä¶ lighter.‚Äù
                        Yamamoto regards my canvas, tilting her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Lighter?</i> I try looking at the canvas the way she is.
                        But it
                        doesn‚Äôt seem out of the norm of what I usually paint.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLike, what gives?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I bite my lip. ‚ÄúI <i class="calibre5">might</i> be seeing someone.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding me!‚Äù She smiles, pulls up a stool beside me. ‚ÄúWait, let me
                        guess.
                        Tall, lanky kid? Kind of good-looking? Who conveniently comes into the art room at lunch, but
                        someone I‚Äôve never had in art class before?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I smile at the thought of B·∫£o hearing how he was described‚Ä¶ until her words
                        catch
                        up with me. I nearly drop my paint brush, but Yamamoto only laughs. ‚ÄúSaw him the other day. It‚Äôs
                        fine,
                        of course. I remember being your age. And from what I can tell‚Äù&mdash;she gestures to the
                        canvas,
                        still seeing what I can‚Äôt &mdash;‚Äúspending time with him is making you happy. And your art‚Äôs
                        never
                        been better. At the same time, I‚Äôm still supposed to be your teacher. So if it happens again,
                        you‚Äôll
                        get sent to the principal‚Äôs office.‚Äù The threat‚Äôs diminished by her subsequent wink.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Yamamoto turns to leave, throwing me another grin that makes her look years
                        younger. ‚ÄúThis is the type of thing they like to see.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWho?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúScholastic. Gold Key.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre12">‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I say, blushing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs going to be a long time until you nd out the results. So, to hold
                        you
                        over, I‚Äôm giving you an early holiday gift.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now I‚Äôm dubious. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never given me a gift before.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI will now.‚Äù She beams. ‚ÄúGuess who I want to spotlight at the end of the year
                        Art
                        Fair?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So caught in more looming deadlines&mdash;and crises&mdash;I‚Äôd forgotten about
                        the
                        Art Fair. Only one person gets spotlighted in their own exhibition. And all previous artists who
                        were lucky enough to get picked had also won various Scholastic awards. Yamamoto has said again
                        and
                        again that this was just a coincidence and that what happened at school had no bearing on
                        Scholastic
                        results. But the myth is there, and in the past I‚Äôd even believed it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I just never believed it could happen to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000032.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>

                    <p class="calibre1">As if the world is conspiring to help us make up for lost time, B·∫£o and I get a

                        to ourselves one Sunday. M·∫π left early to visit a friend‚Äôs house to cut herbs and bring home
                        fruit,
                        which translated to a daylong a air of gossiping and catching up about their families. M·∫π will
                        drop
                        Evie‚Äôs name a few times, I‚Äôm sure of it. That also meant Dad would want to make his own outing
                        to
                        visit friends at their restaurants and caf√©s.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôd always imagined going on a first date would be the most nerve-racking
                        thing, an
                        event that would set my stomach alight with butterflies. A time for two people who like each
                        other to
                        be alone. But for me and B·∫£o, we‚Äôve only known <i class="calibre5">how</i> to be alone. So as
                        I‚Äôm
                        walking toward our meeting spot, I feel no different from when I‚Äôm with him in the art room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Until I see him: standing in the middle of the park, fresh from the shower
                        since
                        his hair is still wet. He‚Äôs wearing a button-up red-and-black plaid shirt and loose jeans, and
                        smiles cheekily once he‚Äôs spotted me. The butterflies kick up in</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">flight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He points to my camera. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt aware you wanted to document this. Should I
                        sign
                        a form of consent?‚Äù he teases me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-213" class="calibre12">‚ÄúI capture memories, remember?‚Äù I snap a photo of
                        him&mdash;he covers his eyes. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs been ages since I‚Äôve used it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He poses, lifting his chin up. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll volunteer to be your model. I‚Äôm a
                        great model.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSays who?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo one.‚Äù B·∫£o grins. ‚ÄúAbsolutely no one.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what I thought.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Laughter and movement from behind catches my eye.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Perfect</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHold still,‚Äù I whisper.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I laugh as his eyes widen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A family celebrating a birthday has taken over a table, filling it with
                        mouthwatering
                        food and presents. Some brought balloons of all colors, weighing them with a rock. Cerulean,
                        canary
                        yellow, and cherry red bump and bob next to each other. But from where B·∫£o is standing, it‚Äôs
                        almost
                        as if the balloons are sprouting from his head. Smiling, I look through my camera. <i
                            class="calibre5">Click</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then B·∫£o is free to move, whirling around. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a bee, I‚Äôll run.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNo, look.‚Äù I move closer to him and he dips his head down to see my camera
                        screen.
                        He smells as fresh and clean as cotton.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNice.‚Äù Our eyes meet&mdash;an indescribable <i class="calibre5">whoosh</i>
                        passes
                        between us, so strong I feel the need to look away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo where to?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We pass a squad of elderly Asian women, coordinated by their visors, oversize
                        sunglasses, and faces whitened with 80 SPF sunscreen. They‚Äôre windmilling their arms. They look
                        at
                        us as if we‚Äôre in the way&mdash;and for one small moment, I wonder if any of them have come to
                        either of our restaurants or know our parents&mdash;and imagine how quickly this would travel.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And how possible it‚Äôd be for everything to unravel in an instant.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúJudging by your look,‚Äù B·∫£o says, interrupting my spiral of thoughts, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre
                        thinking that we probably shouldn‚Äôt have our first date so close to home.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSpies.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúExactly what Vi·ªát said. So, I have a place in mind that I think you‚Äôll like.
                        Do
                        you trust me?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre12">I thread my fingers through his.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 33</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">As I‚Äôm driving, doubt creeps in. Did I really pick the right place to go on a
                        date?
                        An ad for Ellen‚Äôs Studio appeared during a search&mdash;as if the universe was taking pity on me
                        as
                        I considered different date ideas. It was far away enough that no one would know us. And it was
                        something creative, perfect for Linh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Confidence in my plan dimmed when I made the mistake of telling Vi·ªát about it.
                        He
                        replied with a straight face, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you supposed to impress your date? Not embarrass
                        yourself?‚Äù We
                        were in the kitchen then, so the line cooks and other servers&mdash;Eddie and Tr·∫ßn
                        included&mdash;then offered their own dating advice that seemed borderline illegal and might
                        have
                        been fun, I don‚Äôt know, back in the nineties.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I sneak a look at Linh. She‚Äôs wearing a jean skirt and a white flowy blouse, a
                        part
                        of it tucked in. A picture of comfort. She catches me looking and I will myself to stay put and
                        not
                        look away like I would‚Äôve months ago. A bright smile graces her face like we haven‚Äôt seen each
                        other
                        in days. A thrill shudders through me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Once we stop at the plaza, Linh leans her head out the window and makes a noise
                        of
                        surprise at the storefront. ‚ÄúPottery?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She unbuckles her seat belt and slips out. I follow her, watching with some
                        hesitation. Her eyes go soft and she slips her arms around my middle, almost mirroring her
                        impromptu
                        hug that day we decided to start all of this. ‚ÄúWhere did you find out about this place?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, I heard it was good. I love‚Ä¶ er, ceramics.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLiar,‚Äù she whispers, before fitting her hand into mine, leading me inside. I‚Äôm
                        content to follow her. Inside, my veins are like highways and all cells rushing through me like
                        high-speed cars.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWheel-throwing,‚Äù that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called, the instructor
                        tells us, but we can‚Äôt throw the wheel? Her voice, melodious and deep, demands our attention,
                        and
                        for a few minutes Linh and I watch as she demonstrates how to handle the clay and gently shape
                        it.
                        The wheel should be at a medium pace, and she makes us practice. But I might be doing it wrong,
                        because the clay wobbles unevenly. Laughter sounds from next to me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs been watching me, but now she‚Äôs purposefully focusing on the teacher.
                        Her
                        lips twitch.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, shut up.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour face says it all.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I stop pretending to be mad when Linh has her turn at the wheel. Her hands
                        merely
                        guide the clay into the shape it‚Äôs meant to be&mdash;no frantic movements to force it one way or
                        another. ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôre good at this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not. I‚Äôm just okay. My aunt, though, does this for a living.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe one in Vietnam.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYeah, I haven‚Äôt seen her in ages. But she‚Äôs coming over because some of her
                        international friends are displaying their work around the country.‚Äù You had to be pretty smart
                        to
                        navigate a foreign country like that. ‚ÄúMy mom‚Äôs already worried about her. She‚Äôs acting like the
                        older sister and all that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The mention of her mom prompts my question. ‚ÄúSo do you think your aunt knows
                        what
                        happened between our families?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs nice!‚Äù the instructor interjects. At Linh or someone else; we‚Äôre
                        not
                        paying attention.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible that she wouldn‚Äôt. I mean, if my mom and your mom
                        were
                        actually friends, surely they would have known each other. Hung out together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you think you‚Äôll get a chance to talk to her about it? When she‚Äôs here?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúStill figuring out how to approach that. But yeah.‚Äù Linh gets tired of her
                        hair
                        falling into her face and hurriedly brushes it away with the back of her hand. In her rush, clay
                        that caught on her wrist swipes across her cheek. I wait a few seconds. She still doesn‚Äôt
                        notice. Of
                        course.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-217" class="calibre12">Our instructor stops by, examining Linh‚Äôs work: a small
                        teacup. Mine‚Äôs just a cylinder, like the cardboard that‚Äôs left over when toilet paper runs out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy, you‚Äôve done this before, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh smiles politely. ‚ÄúA few times.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The instructor nods her head in approval and her eyes slide over to mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd yours‚Ä¶‚Äù She quickly assesses it and takes a breath. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad you
                        could
                        come by today.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She walks away, leaving Linh in a t of laughter and me trying to hold my
                        dignity
                        intact.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI tried.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, you did.‚Äù She shakes her head. ‚ÄúThough this is fun for me, you must be
                        bored
                        out of your mind. We could have done something else, you know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut I chose this place because I thought you‚Äôd like it. Also, I‚Äôd never use
                        the
                        word ‚Äòboring‚Äô to describe what it‚Äôs like being around you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh? And what words would you use instead, Mr. Wordsmith?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHonestly, my vocabulary isn‚Äôt big enough for what you‚Äôre asking.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I won‚Äôt tire from that look in her eyes. Soft amusement, a moment where the
                        worries
                        slide from her mind. Her hand rests on mine. ‚ÄúThanks. I‚Äôm having fun. But it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm with
                        you.
                        Next time, we‚Äôll go where you want.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Next time.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I refuse to let go of her hand until the instructor tells us to place our
                        ceramics
                        on a shelf.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs trade,‚Äù Linh says suddenly. ‚ÄúMine for yours.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut then you‚Äôre stuck with mine.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs one of a kind. It‚Äôs something that you made.‚Äù She tilts her
                        head, sending me a dazzling smile. ‚ÄúSo I like it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, one more thing, then. Need to mark it with something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">On the bottom of each ceramic&mdash;the teacup and the
                        whatever-the-hell-it-is&mdash; I etch our initials: <i class="calibre5">BN + LM</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I get a kiss for that.</p>

                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">One of the places I‚Äôd pick to represent California, the real California, where
                        people grew up their whole lives, planted their roots, and left things behind for their family
                        to
                        take over, would be Huntington Beach. People know colors here, with their skateboards,
                        parasailers,
                        and sunglasses screaming out their personality. Hip-hop beats from boomboxes and live musicians,
                        mostly guitarists, clash in the air. Everything is alive here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When we were kids, Evie and I could have spent all day here if it weren‚Äôt for
                        my
                        parents, who were wary of too much time in the sun. Never mind that they always slathered the
                        both
                        of us in too much sunscreen. Never mind that we were mostly sitting under umbrellas. We‚Äôd beg
                        them
                        to buy us cotton candy, but would get a lecture about cavities and bad teeth. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm
                        getting
                        the chance to enjoy things now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o offers me his hand, and I take it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI like your face today.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I laugh. ‚ÄúI believe you‚Äôd call that a <i class="calibre5">non sequitur</i>.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre speaking my language.‚Äù B·∫£o pulls me in by the waist. He doesn‚Äôt explain
                        right away, just holds me close. ‚ÄúI meant that I like how calm you look right now. You‚Äôre not
                        worried. The thing between your eyebrows‚Äù&mdash;he pokes me at that spot&mdash;‚Äúisn‚Äôt there.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe wrinkle‚Äôs not always there.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNot always, but I notice it when it appears.‚Äù He swings our arms.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell, I have one less thing to worry about&mdash;my application‚Äôs sent off. So
                        I
                        guess it <i class="calibre5">is</i> better than before. But that‚Äôs been replaced now by
                        something
                        else to worry about, right?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre12">‚ÄúOur moms, yeah. And however your aunt might fit in.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I nod. ‚ÄúI know we have to ask. I know. But a part of me doesn‚Äôt want to. To
                        find out something that might change everything.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary. I think we have to ask the question eventually. If we really want
                        this‚Äù&mdash;he holds up our clasped hands&mdash;‚Äúto work. I hate hiding. I hate not being able
                        to
                        kiss you before we go to work, right across from each other. I hate not being able to walk in
                        the
                        park near our homes, just because I might be seen with you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI hate that too,‚Äù I say. The feeling of lying has become all too familiar.
                        It‚Äôs
                        not the nervousness of hiding something now&mdash;it‚Äôs the shame that weighs me down, more and
                        more.
                        ‚ÄúBut you know how our parents are with the past. What if, by asking questions, we make things
                        worse?
                        With our parents? With us?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut if we don‚Äôt start asking these questions‚Ä¶‚Äù He shakes his head. ‚ÄúRemember
                        what
                        Chef L√™ said? About having these questions he wants to ask his mom but knowing he can‚Äôt because
                        she‚Äôs gone?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow it‚Äôs too late?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat could be us one day. One day, they‚Äôre not going to be around as much.
                        That‚Äôs
                        what‚Äôs happening next year&mdash;we‚Äôre going to college and they‚Äôll be living out their
                        lives&mdash;and in no time, it‚Äôll happen. The chance to ask will pass.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">On our way back, dusk is our cover. Me and B·∫£o hold hands&mdash;his clean, mine
                        still stained with paint no matter how clean I tried to make them. I mention that to B·∫£o, but he
                        only shrugs. ‚ÄúFeels like a hand. Feels like mine.‚Äù He reaches our clasped hands up, kissing
                        mine,
                        then smiling, knowing I was watching, probably blushing. ‚ÄúPlus, you wouldn‚Äôt be you without it.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Together we walk into the ocean and take in the waters that stretch ahead of
                        us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I ask, looking up at him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNothing. Just‚Ä¶‚Äù He trails off as he leans forward, and our lips touch again. I
                        slip
                        my fingers into his hair. My heart beats double-time, and the way he‚Äôs looking at me sends a
                        rush of
                        heat through me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I meet him there when he ducks his head to kiss me. It‚Äôs him making a strange
                        sound
                        when I stand up so that I‚Äôm flush against him. I can feel all of him, him me. A small wave
                        crashes
                        against us and I stumble until he catches me at just the right time. We laugh together, our
                        sound
                        mingling with nearby notes of happiness: kids shrieking as they splash up a storm, squawking
                        seagulls flying and dipping into the ocean, lazy guitar music tickling our ears. The most
                        perfect day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">A phone call wakes me up. I hear murmuring from down the hall, until I hear an
                        exclamation. I stop mid-stretch, waiting to hear more, but the whispers return and then nothing.
                        <i class="calibre5">Am I dreaming?</i> It happens sometimes, whenever I shut off my iPhone
                        alarm,
                        feeling a false confidence that I‚Äôll get up, and I descend into a dream where I do just that:
                        wake
                        up, eat breakfast, go to school, as if everything was normal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I drift above myself until the cabinet door slamming shut wakes me up
                        completely.
                        I‚Äôm still in bed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This time, I walk to the kitchen, clearing away the gunk from my eyes. M·∫π is

                        directing his rant at M·∫π. Ba ignores me, his newspaper forgotten, and punches in some numbers on
                        his
                        cell phone. He disappears from the room; I can sense his anger but I can‚Äôt hear it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He mentioned a woman. Only one person can get Ba this riled up. But rats&mdash;

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWill everything be okay?‚Äù I repeat. She doesn‚Äôt answer, only leans against the

                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">In the morning, a half hour before classes start, I head to the art room, where
                        Linh
                        texted me to meet her. The lights are on low, the sun straining for passage through the
                        blinders.
                        Long shadows cast against the oor. Motes of dust drift lazily across the room. At first I can‚Äôt
                        nd
                        Linh, but she‚Äôs there, on the center stool, facing a blank canvas. She sits empty-handed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs it so dark in here?‚Äù I ask, approaching her. I lean down, aiming for a
                        kiss,
                        but her lips are still against mine. I tilt my head in question. ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù A sense of
                        foreboding washes over me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour parents spread a rumor about our restaurant.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat rumor?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She gnaws on her bottom lip. ‚ÄúRats.‚Äù</p>

                        though. No
                        way. Linh, they might be harsh sometimes, but to spread a rumor like that‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs <i

                    <p class="calibre12">They‚Äôre my parents. This rumor‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs beyond my mom. She isn‚Äôt cruel. They

                        Mai.
                        ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just ask them.‚Äù</p>

                        competition.
                        They wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ would they?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to them,‚Äù I repeat, wanting to make it sound like that will solve
                        everything.</p>
                    \ <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">School passes in a blur, my thoughts occupied by Linh, by the rats, by my
                        parents‚Äô
                        potential hand in it. Even Ali, perhaps after texting or talking with Linh, leaves me relatively
                        alone in journalism class. And then I get a text from Linh saying they need to close down the
                        restaurant for a day. The inspector is still coming by, regardless of her parents‚Äô efforts to
                        dispel
                        the rumor.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">One day gone; one day of potential pro ts gone.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When I get to the restaurant, M·∫π‚Äôs circle is there at the usual booth. Ba is
                        elsewhere; he might have gone to visit his friends&mdash;the husbands of the very wives his own
                        wife
                        befriended. Friends. Followers. Whatever they call themselves. As annoying as their laughs were
                        before, it‚Äôs even more grating today, since I know what they may be laughing about. They‚Äôre
                        celebrating. Hyenas laughing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π, can I see you for a second?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, hi, con. Are you hungry? I just made a new batch of
                        ph·ªü
                        and can get it ready for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNot hungry.‚Äù Not while Linh‚Äôs&mdash;or her mother‚Äôs&mdash;accusation clings to
                        me
                        like a cloying cologne. I sense the General‚Äôs eyes on me, as well as the other women‚Äôs. ‚ÄúCan we
                        go
                        to the back?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In the kitchen, alone with me, my mom moves around as if nothing is wrong. She
                        flicks
                        on the stovetop, reheating a stock pot of broth, seemingly ignoring what I said before about not
                        being hungry.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI heard there‚Äôs rats going around. Not here but at the restaurant across the
                        street. Have you heard anything like that?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Something passes over my mom‚Äôs face, too quickly for me to catch. But her tone,
                        as
                        she answers, is even and as hard as int. ‚ÄúYes, I think I heard that too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut they don‚Äôt have rats.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I sag against the counter behind me. I hear the challenge in her voice and it
                        con
                        rms it all. I wanted Linh to be wrong. So badly. But this is a deflection. My mom‚Äôs purposefully
                        not
                        answering my question, which can only mean‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The rumors. My mom <i class="calibre5">did</i> spread them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The headache from earlier today comes back full force. Maybe that‚Äôs why my next
                        questions come out louder than I expected, louder than I‚Äôd ever spoken&mdash; dared to
                        speak&mdash;to my mom. ‚ÄúWhy is it always <i class="calibre5">them,</i> M·∫π? Why are you always
                        trying
                        to ruin <i class="calibre5">them</i>? What, like they‚Äôre not people, too? They‚Äôre like you, M·∫π.
                        They
                        have this job, it‚Äôs what they do to put food on the table, pay for their oldest daughter‚Äôs
                        tuition.
                        Linh‚Äôs graduating soon, too. This rumor could really ruin things for them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π‚Äôs mouth falls open. Then closes. Opens again. Stunned. ‚ÄúHow do you know all
                        of
                        this?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúKnow <i class="calibre5">what</i>?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh. It sounds like you know her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This is it. Maybe if she accused me of this earlier in the year, before I knew
                        how
                        I really felt about Linh, I‚Äôd waver and deny being close to Linh. I remember Linh in my arms,
                        trembling from anger and worry.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-225" class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know Linh because I‚Äôm friends with her. Been friends
                        with
                        her for a few months now.‚Äù <i class="calibre5">And we‚Äôre more than that now.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">G√¨</i>?‚Äù she asks me to repeat myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A river of laughter from her circle reaches the edges of our space, but it dies
                        down, engulfed by the tension between me and my mom.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe were partnered up for an assignment,‚Äù I continue, watching her expression.
                        ‚ÄúThe

                        the Vietnamese chef, and other places&mdash;I‚Äôve been going with her and she‚Äôs been making the

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that possible?‚Äù she asks almost in wonder, before her tone switches up,
                        reprimanding me. ‚ÄúI told you never to talk to them. Never to interact with them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhich never made sense to me. It‚Äôs impossible to avoid them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, it is possible if you make it so. If you listen to what I told you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt listen to you,‚Äù I say, my voice gathering strength.
                        I‚Äôve
                        gone this far, and I don‚Äôt see a way back. ‚ÄúBut I like Linh, M·∫π. I realize she‚Äôs just like me.
                        With
                        a family just like ours. She‚Äôs one of the nicest people you‚Äôve ever met. And I don‚Äôt know what
                        you
                        have against her family&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat has she said? About our family?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her question throws me off. I cross my arms, suspicious. Instead of chewing me
                        out
                        for admitting that I was friends with her, she asks <i class="calibre5">that</i> question? ‚ÄúWhy
                        does
                        she have to say anything about us?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π closes her mouth. ‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù She swiftly turns. A line cook steps into
                        the
                        kitchen, AirPods in. She barks at him, bringing him out of his musical reverie, to clean up the
                        prep
                        table a bit more. I could feel her anger, even if it were miles away. Most of the time I keep it
                        separate, observing it from afar. Sometimes my dad and I can laugh it off. Simply steer clear.
                        But
                        now, the anger is like tar. I‚Äôm a part of it. I‚Äôm the reason for it. I feel what she feels.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat <i class="calibre5">do</i> they know about us? What aren‚Äôt you telling
                        me?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNothing for you to worry about.‚Äù She turns her back, busying herself with
                        moving
                        around pots and pans. The line cook, sensing the mood of the room, quickly departs, leaving me
                        to
                        ask:</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π, is this about what happened in Vietnam? What B√°c Xu√¢n knows?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-226" class="calibre12">She slams an empty pot against the stovetop before
                        whirling
                        around. Before I know it, she‚Äôs around the table, yanking me toward the back entrance to our
                        alley,
                        until we‚Äôre both outside, standing between a heap of black trash bags and broken-down cardboard
                        boxes. ‚ÄúHow did you&mdash;<i class="calibre5">why</i> are you asking these questions?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm trying to figure all of this shit out!‚Äù I yell freely. ‚ÄúAll of the
                        secrets. The way you‚Äôre acting. Why I can‚Äôt even mention Linh and her family‚Äôs name without
                        getting
                        this kind of reaction from you! Or maybe it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want to think that you, M·∫π, could
                        do
                        this to another family. This can‚Äôt be you, M·∫π. I didn‚Äôt think you could be this cruel.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCruel?‚Äù My mom sucks in a breath. A movement catches my attention, rendering
                        me
                        speechless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Tears.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Falling like snowy specks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look to the side, hating to see them. My body screams at me, my heart
                        thudding at
                        the idea of betraying her&mdash;<i class="calibre5">you made her cry; you did this!</i> But
                        another
                        voice inside me protests: <i class="calibre5">She is crying because she‚Äôs guilty</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me who said it,‚Äù she finally whispers. ‚ÄúIt was D√¨ Nhi. It was said
                        inside
                        this restaurant; I didn‚Äôt think anyone would take it seriously. It wasn‚Äôt meant to leave here.
                        I‚Äôll
                        talk to her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The admission doesn‚Äôt help. Not one bit. ‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt help. This is D√¨ Nhi we‚Äôre
                        talking about. Everything she says takes on a life of its own. And you should have stopped her.
                        And
                        now their restaurant‚Äôs in danger.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCon being dramatic. It will go away. Like all rumors. So M·∫π not sure why con
                        being
                        so&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh told me a health inspector‚Äôs coming by. Making them close down for the
                        whole
                        day. Imagine if you had to do that, M·∫π.‚Äù I turn my back on her. ‚ÄúLinh‚Äôs just like me. And she‚Äôs
                        scared of what‚Äôs going to happen to <i class="calibre5">her</i> parents, to <i
                            class="calibre5">their</i> restaurant. It‚Äôs their only means of living.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I can‚Äôt be near her, not right now. I almost turn to go back into the
                        restaurant,
                        when suddenly her voice stops me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour uncle died because of that girl‚Äôs family. My brother died‚Ä¶ because of <i

                        echoing back at me.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 36</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs crushing to see my parents look scared. Because when they‚Äôre frightened
                        they‚Äôre
                        no longer the people who raised me to be strong, but strangers who look older than they really
                        are.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The inspector came by. He‚Äôs Vietnamese as well. He gave my parents a brisk
                        handshake, clipboard under his armpit, but before stepping into the dining area, he gave a good
                        sweep of the room, eyes calculating. I wondered if he was judging us, how we lived. I wanted to
                        yell
                        that this was all a cruel joke. It was embarrassing to have him rummaging through the kitchen
                        cabinets, bending over and checking under the tables, feeling along the walls for cracks and
                        damages.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Despite the Health Department clearing us, I see how the rumor has done damage
                        afterward&mdash;small, but damage nonetheless. Customers who‚Äôd visited us daily dropped o until
                        Ba,
                        turning on his charisma, appealed to them, explained the situation, offered them discounts on
                        future
                        meals. The favors that my parents were so reluctant to ask for are used now to recoup whatever
                        unquantifiable loss the rumor had cost us. Luckily, it seems like the stream of new customers
                        hasn‚Äôt
                        been affected.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">There‚Äôs no way to tell if B·∫£o‚Äôs talk with his mom helped in that matter, but
                        the
                        next time I saw him, he said his mother promised to have a word with Nhi Tr∆∞ng, the real
                        culprit. He
                        doesn‚Äôt say much more, though. Sometimes I catch him spacing out, eyebrows furrowed. I‚Äôm prone
                        to
                        daydreams, but not B·∫£o. So he must be bothered by something.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I would hate it if his relationship with his mother was tainted by this. Even
                        if
                        she did play a part in spreading the rumor&mdash;even if&mdash;I don‚Äôt want to demonize her.
                        Just
                        like I wouldn‚Äôt want B·∫£o to demonize my own parents for their prejudice.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre12">He feels maybe more unreachable, even as we spend most of
                        our
                        free time at Chef L√™‚Äôs restaurant, finishing up the mural. I like painting from this height; I‚Äôm
                        untouchable, unreachable, too‚Ä¶ and everything below is smaller. Issues farther away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That same distance seems to overtake my parents. I rarely see them in the
                        morning,
                        and when I work after school, they‚Äôre preoccupied at the restaurant. D√¨ V√†ng‚Äôs visit is only a
                        few
                        days away, too. It‚Äôd be impossible to bring up what I heard from B√°c Xu√¢n. Lately, B·∫£o doesn‚Äôt
                        seem
                        as intent on finding out more about our families‚Äô shared past.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I feel, somehow, that me and B·∫£o are running out of time. That the both of us
                        are
                        being pushed toward an edge, but we won‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll go over until the very moment it
                        happens.

                    <h3>Chapter 37</h3>
                    <h2>Bao
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">In the next two weeks, my mom makes herself scarce. She talks to me, but
                        pretends that she didn‚Äôt drop a bomb on me about Linh‚Äôs family being possible murderers. We
                        don‚Äôt even discuss my friendship with Linh, and I don‚Äôt know if she really thinks I‚Äôll follow
                        her request to not see Linh. At this point, I can‚Äôt. I won‚Äôt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt tell Linh, either, secure in the knowledge that M·∫π wouldn‚Äôt want to
                        tell anyone. Even her gossip group. They still come in, and when they see me, they still treat
                        me with the same level of disinterest. Their laughter is the same as I retreat to the back.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">When I‚Äôm not at work or at home, conscious of this weird shift in my
                        relationship with my mom, I find refuge at Chef L√™‚Äôs. I watch as Linh‚Äôs mural blooms to life. At
                        her request, we‚Äôre not letting Chef L√™ past the curtains anymore; she wants to surprise him with
                        a reveal. Saffron‚Äôs gotten a peek at it, though.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She‚Äôd carried her ten-month-old son Philippe against her hip. He was yanking at
                        the handkerchief wrapped snug around her neck, but she paid him no mind, taking in Linh‚Äôs work
                        of art. Beaming. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll love it. He‚Äôll absolutely love it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In exchange, Chef L√™ said he wants to invite a few friends over for the reveal
                        and close down the restaurant for the night. It‚Äôll be small, he said, and it‚Äôll be a chance to
                        ‚Äúdebut Miss Mai‚Äù and ‚Äúshare her talents with the world.‚Äù Well, Fountain Valley, at least. Linh
                        tried to protest but she was up against four people &mdash;Chef L√™ counts as two. She really had
                        no choice.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 38</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Soon enough, it comes time for Chef L√™ to reveal his mural to his friends and
                        family. His missive to me and B·∫£o, as well as Vi·ªát and Ali, is to dress ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure
                        what
                        that means coming from a man who wears T-shirts underneath his chef‚Äôs jacket.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm not expected to work tonight and M·∫π and Ba are already at the restaurant.
                        <i class="calibre5">It‚Äôll be a late night. Food is in the fridge</i>, reads the sticky note in
                        my
                        mom‚Äôs neat cursive.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm about leave for Ch∆°i ∆†i, nally settling on a strapless black dress paired
                        with
                        an old burgundy shawl I found my in my mom‚Äôs closet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">As I‚Äôm in the closet, curious, I see old boxes of photos. My parents always
                        tell me
                        they‚Äôll put these photos into neat scrapbooks. First it was planned for the weekend, then during
                        the
                        holidays when things died down, and now they‚Äôve pushed it to retirement age. But my dad, in his
                        defense, did start the project.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Not</i> in his defense, he got tired by the time the photos
                        started showing Evie at age four and me age three.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My parents keep the photos in bulging shoeboxes from Payless, Ann Taylor, and
                        Adidas. But the sepia photos from Vietnam are stored in pocketbooks, underneath crinkling
                        plastic.
                        There are a lot of beach photos&mdash;a given, since Nha Trang‚Äôs known for its beaches.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In one photo, my mom lounges on the beach in a one-piece, sunglasses tangled up
                        in
                        her hair. Behind her is my aunt, who might have just pushed her from behind&mdash;their smiles
                        are
                        identical, even with ve years in between them. It seems impossible to think that outside the
                        frame
                        of this photo, the country they knew was changing rapidly. And yet here they were: joyful. The
                        next
                        photo appears to be from the same day, only now they‚Äôre standing. Same with the next handful of
                        photos. I‚Äôve never seen my mom smile so much.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre12">And I stop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o is in this photo, still at the beach, standing right next to my aunt. But
                        that
                        can‚Äôt be. I was just thinking of B·∫£o right this second; that‚Äôs why my mind brought him to mind.
                        That
                        must be why, as I come across this photo, his face appears on the photo.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And yet it‚Äôs not. Of course. This was before he was born. The man‚Äôs hair is far
                        longer than B·∫£o‚Äôs has ever been.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I nd the answer on the other side of not-B·∫£o. I‚Äôve seen her only in glimpses
                        &mdash;coincidental looks as she leaves the restaurant for some reason or another&mdash;
                        including
                        that time at the Vietnamese supermarket.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o‚Äôs mother is in this photo, indisputably confirming what B√°c Xu√¢n shared
                        with me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Two women, who supposedly hated each other, and did everything to avoid each
                        other,
                        are embracing like they‚Äôre sisters. So that must be B·∫£o‚Äôs uncle, the one who died at sea.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Back before the second Ph·ªü Day happened, M·∫π mentioned my aunt had a fianc√©,
                        didn‚Äôt she? Someone who died.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Of course.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs <i class="calibre5">him.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My aunt and his uncle had been together. Until‚Ä¶ what was it? He left, causing
                        his
                        family to lash out and blame my family. What did they say in their defense?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And how the hell did all of that bring us here?</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I take the bus instead of driving, not trusting myself to navigate in this
                        confused,
                        somewhat dizzying state. I bring the photo along, tucked inside one of my dress‚Äôs pockets. It
                        crinkles as I walk a certain way, reminding me of its existence.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-233" class="calibre12">Our parents knew each other back then&mdash;or at least
                        our
                        mothers. And, even though it would have seemed impossible before this photo&mdash;they were good
                        friends. My aunt was in the group as well. Does my aunt know about the Nguy·ªÖns‚Äô restaurant too?
                        Know
                        that they now hate each other?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o and I were wrong, absolutely wrong. It was something entirely bigger than
                        just
                        the businesses. And far bigger than we‚Äôd feared.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I stop. B·∫£o. <i class="calibre5">What am I going to say to B·∫£o? With everything
                            going on!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The dining room is closed for the public tonight, and one of the waiters
                        standing
                        at the door grins when I tell him my name, playfully gesturing me forward. Inside, the room is
                        awash
                        in soft lighting. Jazzy music plays in the background. Ali is dressed up in all black with red
                        shiny-but-sensible heels that still make a statement, and she waves excitedly. Vi·ªát stands next
                        to
                        her, his excitement level less obvious, of course, but he still gives me a small wave, one hand
                        in
                        his pocket. And B·∫£o‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now I know what books and old movies mean by <i class="calibre5">dapper</i>.
                        Like
                        Ali, he‚Äôs dressed in black. He looks far older, and for a moment, a vision of an older B·∫£o
                        &mdash;someone like his uncle in the photo&mdash;supplants itself over my vision. One blink and
                        it‚Äôs
                        the B·∫£o I know again. Once I‚Äôm close enough, he hugs me, lifting me o my feet. I laugh as his
                        kiss
                        meets my crown.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre way more excited than you should be,‚Äù I mumble as I retighten my
                        ponytail.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow can I <i class="calibre5">not</i> be? You have a mural. This is <i

                    <p class="calibre12">Putting aside the last few weeks, I want to tell him about the photo, but the
                        way
                        he‚Äôs looking around the room, pointing out the size of it&mdash;the way he just looks so <i
                            class="calibre5">proud</i> of me makes my throat tighten up. I ignore the photo for a
                        moment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLocal genius displays award-winning art,‚Äù Ali says with her Banner Move, which
                        I
                        approve only in this instance. ‚ÄúLinh, this is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm out of words.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFor once,‚Äù Vi·ªát quips. But he‚Äôs grinning and adds his own congratulations.
                        ‚ÄúYou

                    <p id="calibre_link-234" class="calibre12">Focused on finding my friends, I forgot to really look
                        around.
                        The other guests must be Chef L√™‚Äôs friends&mdash;people in the restaurant circuit. A couple are
                        dressed in bright colors&mdash;artists? Fashion designers? The idea of Chef L√™ having all sorts
                        of
                        friends from di erent crowds feels right.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMiss Mai!‚Äù Chef L√™ shouts, barreling through the crowd like an overgrown
                        puppy. He
                        gives me his signature bear hug, and I feel a wave of affection wash over me. ‚ÄúYou ready for
                        this?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDid you have to invite this many people?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">This many people</i>. This is the smallest gathering I‚Äôve
                        ever
                        had. Didn‚Äôt want to overwhelm you.‚Äù He playfully pushes me by the shoulder, crashing me into
                        B·∫£o,
                        who catches me and grins. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, the mural‚Äôs so great. Everyone in Orange County has to see
                        it.‚Äù
                        And with that, he pulls me by the elbow into the center of the crowd. My friends laugh, trailing
                        behind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFriends, you know this place is my baby and I love showing it off. I want
                        everyone
                        to be reminded of why they‚Äôre here. For me, it‚Äôs a reminder of why I‚Äôm here, how I‚Äôm the chef
                        right
                        now. It‚Äôs a reminder of everything that my parents have done. Especially my mom.‚Äù He clears his
                        throat as a somber look passes over him. His father, or who I assume to be his father, clasps
                        him on
                        the shoulder, showing his support. ‚ÄúI wish M·∫π could have been here to see what the restaurant‚Äôs
                        become, and I hope to God that she knows she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about little me anymore.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A respectful silence settles in the room. A few people clap in encouragement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell, not <i class="calibre5">little</i> me, because, you know.‚Äù The mood
                        shifts
                        again&mdash;laughter. ‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôm intentional in everything that goes into this restaurant.
                        It‚Äôs
                        Vietnamese, one hundred percent, and I like to think the decorations are reflective of that. But
                        this
                        column‚Äù&mdash;he points&mdash;‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt figure it out. I needed something.‚Äù He pauses
                        dramatically.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I was so excited to meet a special artist who came in here with a
                        young
                        man. Before they met me, believe it or not, they were <i class="calibre5">just friends</i>, but
                        you
                        know how I like to meddle&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o clears his throat. ‚ÄúUm, Chef L√™&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay, okay. Long story short: I‚Äôm the only reason they got together and they
                        should thank me,‚Äù he adds in a rush, despite B·∫£o‚Äôs suggestion. The crowd laughs and I glance in
                        mock
                        suffering at B·∫£o, but instead of embarrassment, the look in his eyes is soft like the warm glow
                        of
                        the light above us. ‚ÄúAll I want to say is I told you so. Anyway, they wrote this bomb piece for
                        their school newspaper but it was better than anything I‚Äôve ever read. And it led me to discover
                        the
                        extraordinary talent that is Linh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-235" class="calibre12">He gestures for me to stand next to him and I‚Äôm
                        emboldened by
                        the applause. ‚ÄúIs everyone ready?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The wrap falls with a <i class="calibre5">whoosh</i>. A flash blinds me for a
                        split
                        second.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I haven‚Äôt seen the mural from afar in this kind of lighting. I‚Äôd only been up
                        close, using the smallest brushes imaginable, observing for all kinds of imperfections, and so I
                        rarely stood aside to see what I was building layer by layer, color by color. The crowd eases
                        forward, murmuring to one another. B·∫£o slips his hand into mine, squeezing, and a few feet away,
                        Chef L√™ is pointing out details of the mural to the friends closest to him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs a collage of him and his mother, based on photos that he gave me: her
                        hugging
                        him on his first day of school, him standing on a stool to help his parents roll out <i
                            class="calibre5">b√°nh bao</i> doughs, all the way up to a scene from last year, of them
                        together
                        in the kitchen. It‚Äôs celebrating her and everything she gave him&mdash; and more.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A round of guests come by to congratulate me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúA high school student did this?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIs she available for other work?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I duck my head at some of the praise, but I can‚Äôt deny how they make me warm
                        all
                        over. ‚ÄúBeautiful,‚Äù B·∫£o says, kissing my temple and hugging me from behind. I lean back against
                        him,
                        my mind running on imagination. Somewhere, far into the future, people might come to my
                        exhibition
                        and feel the same amount of awe that I‚Äôve had toward other artists growing up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I want to stay like this forever.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúIf this writing thing doesn‚Äôt work out, I‚Äôll be your manager.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry, Ali‚Äôs going to be my manager.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre12">‚ÄúPR, then. I‚Äôll write the best PR,‚Äù B·∫£o says as he pulls
                        up a
                        few houses away from mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I laugh. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know a thing about art.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut I know a few things about you,‚Äù he returns cheekily. He leans in as
                        smoothly
                        as he can with his seat belt keeping him back and kisses me twice. He doesn‚Äôt pull away, his
                        eyes
                        roving over my face. Looking for something. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you go&mdash;you‚Äôre probably tired from
                        the
                        all-star treatment that you got.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A satisfied laugh bubbles in my throat, and I want to protest, but he‚Äôs right.
                        We
                        can‚Äôt push it. I slide out of the passenger seat, careful not to close the door too loudly. The
                        movement reminds me of the photo in my pocket, which slips out, catching B·∫£o‚Äôs attention. I grab
                        it,
                        wanting to keep it out of sight, out of mind, just for tonight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù he asks, resting a hand on the steering wheel.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLook closer.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He squints and leans forward, assesses the man‚Äôs head full of hair, his lean
                        frame,
                        his smile&mdash;and disbelief dawns on his face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my uncle.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶ ? Isn‚Äôt that‚Ä¶ ?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy mom and my aunt.‚Äù I exhale. ‚ÄúB·∫£o, there is more to the story. First it was
                        my
                        mom and your mom. Then there was the question about my aunt, but here it is. Proof. My aunt and
                        your
                        uncle were together at some point.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o releases his hold on the steering wheel, dragging both hands through his
                        hair.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat do you know about him?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe died,‚Äù he says, staring straight ahead. ‚ÄúHe tried to escape by boat first,
                        but he
                        died. And my mom doesn‚Äôt talk about him much. Hurts too much, I think.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course. It was her brother.‚Äù I try to think, try to connect the dots
                        between my
                        mom, my aunt, his mom, and his uncle, and I know there <i class="calibre5">is</i> something, but
                        everything feels unfocused. Just out of reach. ‚ÄúI think he was the one my aunt almost married.
                        But
                        he left. For some reason he left.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o is tight-lipped. I feel his mind working itself into a frenzy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI told my mom about you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-237" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI told her how we became friends, how we worked together. I didn‚Äôt mention <i
                            class="calibre5">what</i> we are, but I think she knows. But she didn‚Äôt really blow up about
                        that. It was what she said after, and I didn‚Äôt tell you right away because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin
                        things. I didn‚Äôt want there to be another reason for us not to be together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB·∫£o?‚Äù I slip my hand back into his. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. You can tell me.‚Äù I don‚Äôt care
                        that he didn‚Äôt tell me right away; I tried hiding the picture from him. We both didn‚Äôt want to
                        ruin
                        things. Now, even if we don‚Äôt have all the pieces, we‚Äôre gravitating closer to the truth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy mom said that it‚Äôs your family‚Äôs fault that my uncle died.‚Äù He turns his
                        head,
                        meeting my eyes. ‚ÄúShe called your family murderers.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I suck in sharply. Moths dance around one of my neighbor‚Äôs porch lights. Behind
                        shaded windows, multicolored lights from their television pulse. My gaze falls on my house, dark
                        save for the light from the back of the kitchen, shining half its usual luminosity.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMurderers,‚Äù I whisper. What a horrible word. An impossible reality.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">What does this all mean? How could my mom, my aunt&mdash;or both&mdash;have
                        played
                        a hand in his uncle‚Äôs death? Had they gone with him? Did he drown, then? And where was B·∫£o‚Äôs
                        mother
                        in all of this? ‚ÄúThey couldn‚Äôt have&mdash;‚Äù Killed. Murdered. Done whatever they were rumored to
                        have done.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh, I have no clue what that means. I‚Äôm just saying what she said, but‚Ä¶
                        fuck,
                        this is all messed up.‚Äù The desperation in his voice pulls me back into the car, and I reach for
                        his
                        hand. ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know what to think.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know either, B·∫£o. I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe have to talk to them. At least we have something tangible in front of us.
                        They
                        can‚Äôt deny it now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI can only nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Tomorrow. The truth will come out tomorrow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o kisses me goodbye. We linger, noses touching, breathing in and out again.
                        Then,
                        he gives me one last kiss. He backs up and drives off, leaving me wondering how I‚Äôll be able to
                        go to
                        sleep tonight.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre12">But then my living room lights snap on, the curtains part
                        sharply, and two silhouettes appear, facing me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My parents are home.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000037.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The exaltation from tonight‚Äôs showing, the peace that I felt being with
                        B·∫£o&mdash;it
                        all gradually disappeared as details of the photo came out and B·∫£o told me what his mother said.
                        Any
                        good feeling that was left bursts into nonexistence the moment I step into the house.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My parents‚Äô shoes are by the front door, neatly against the wall as always. The
                        room feels colder than usual, but maybe it‚Äôs me, shivering at the prospect of my parents, who‚Äôd
                        come
                        home early to nd an empty house, when I said I‚Äôd be home.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hear them exchange sharp whispers, and they stop when I get to the kitchen
                        threshold. My mom‚Äôs at the kitchen sink, washing dishes. Ba sits at the table, mandarin peels
                        sitting in front of him. Neither looks at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I realized that I needed to finish up a project. And I sort of lost
                        track
                        of time.‚Äù I force out the lie, instantly hating myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mother still doesn‚Äôt turn around. Ba‚Äôs focused on something on his phone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry,‚Äù I say again, hating how stale it sounds.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre late. Not now,‚Äù my mom says. Her voice sounds
                        clogged,
                        like she‚Äôd just been crying a few minutes before.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba abruptly pushes away his chair, as if ready to storm from the kitchen. But
                        he
                        doesn‚Äôt; he just paces, his steps heavy. ‚ÄúAre you going to tell us where you really were for the
                        past hour? Or will you lie again?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh no.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba turns his phone, slides it toward me. His Messages app is open, showing a
                        photo
                        that was received a half hour ago.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The photo is of me and B·∫£o. At the mural reveal, the moment the curtains had
                        fallen. I remember there‚Äôd been a flash, and I guess whoever had taken the picture had sent it
                        his
                        way. ‚ÄúThe person who puts our ads in the newsletters. She was there and told us how proud we
                        should
                        be. To have our talented daughter showcase her first mural!‚Äù Ba shakes his head. ‚ÄúI should have
                        answered, ‚ÄòWhat daughter?‚Äô After all, what daughter hides this from us?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-239" class="calibre12">I feel cold all over. I swallow hard, trying to summon
                        the
                        right words to explain everything. I know I have many things to defend; I don‚Äôt even know where
                        to
                        start. How can I explain meeting B·∫£o? Wanting to do art, not engineering? Being at the reveal,
                        rather than at home? Words are out before I know what to say. ‚ÄúM·∫π, I know I‚Äôm not supposed to
                        talk

                        out into the space between us like a flame on the stove turned up too high.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how to tell you,‚Äù I say weakly. About everything. ‚ÄúBa, M·∫π, I‚Äôve
                        always wanted to be an artist. But I couldn‚Äôt tell you that because you were always saying

                        about D√¨ V√†ng, about how that kind of life will be hard. You‚Äôd never approve.</p>

                        day, you will not need us anymore.‚Äù M·∫π angrily wipes away a lone tear running down her cheek.

                    <p id="calibre_link-241" class="calibre12">The sight of her tears makes my heart feel as if it‚Äôs
                        being
                        gnawed on from the inside. I want to tell her to listen to me, listen to what I‚Äôm saying. But
                        she‚Äôs
                        shaking with anger. Her hair has fallen loose from her clip. And her eyes‚Ä¶ I look down. I think
                        this
                        is the rst time she‚Äôs doubted that I love her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom storms out of the kitchen and a few seconds later, her bedroom door
                        thuds
                        against its frame.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I brace myself, wait for my dad to scream as well. His gaze is on me. Yet, he‚Äôs
                        calm. I think I want him to yell now, because it‚Äôll show he‚Äôs feeling <i
                            class="calibre5">something</i> toward me. But the quiet between us is cold and cut off. Like
                        I‚Äôm
                        beyond reproach, like I‚Äôm worthless.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He snatches up the photo I showed M·∫π. He turns his back on me. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt
                        honor
                        your parents and listen to us&mdash;after all that we have done for you&mdash; then we have
                        failed.
                        We have failed as your parents.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to lie so much,‚Äù I say weakly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba doesn‚Äôt say more. He walks away from me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The next morning, I wake to an empty house. My cheeks are dry and tight from
                        crying.
                        In the kitchen, I splash cold water on my face. My parents have already left for the restaurant.
                        No
                        note or anything, no breakfast Saran-wrapped in the fridge. I wonder what hurt more: the yelling
                        match we had last night or the resulting silence. Disquieting. Unforgiving.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My walk to school is slow and painful, as if my body is also hurting. I keep my
                        head down too, because if I pass someone I know, the polite thing to do is smile, but it‚Äôs not
                        something I can muster. Neither does sitting in class interest me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o‚Äôs at my locker, holding on to his backpack by one strap. I see the worry on
                        his
                        face, then his eyes rove over me, and his eyebrows quickly furrow. Of course I know why; I saw
                        my
                        face in the mirror. It‚Äôs blotchy, my eyes are swollen, and the bags underneath create the
                        illusion
                        that I smeared gray paint below them.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-242" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His look of concern hurts rather than helps. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. Not right now,‚Äù I say. I
                        put
                        in my combination.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt comprehend right away why my touch is slippery, why my vision starts
                        blurring. Then B·∫£o‚Äôs arms are around me, and he‚Äôs mumbling ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù again and I‚Äôm saying
                        things into his chest and he can‚Äôt hear me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Soon enough I‚Äôm half walking, half leaning on B·∫£o as he moves us into an empty
                        classroom. Empty for how long, we‚Äôre not sure. I hate how I‚Äôm a clich√©, crying in the middle of
                        the
                        hallway. People are probably thinking we broke up. They‚Äôre going to go to class and gossip. Roll
                        their eyes, but then forget about it next period.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I tell B·∫£o everything as I nestle against him, last night‚Äôs ugly words between
                        me
                        and my mom flowing out of me in a furious, murky stream. If I could take back last night, I
                        would. If
                        I could go back to the beginning of this year&mdash;before <i

                    <h3>Chapter 39</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I don‚Äôt know what else to do but hold Linh. Drop a kiss on her head now and
                        then.
                        And just hold her more. She‚Äôs trembling, her voice breaks, and I don‚Äôt have anything to give her
                        but
                        physical comfort. Still, it feels empty, temporary, and Linh needs more than that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôve never seen them look at me that way. Especially my mother. It
                        looked
                        like I broke her heart.‚Äù Linh sniffs. ‚ÄúAnd maybe I was too honest toward the end. Throwing that
                        photo
                        in their faces only complicated things more.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think that. You got it out there. All the things you were holding back
                        for
                        months. It‚Äôs there.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt say that telling my mom about Linh made things better&mdash;but
                        it
                        didn‚Äôt make things worse. Just uncomfortable. I‚Äôm more disturbed that she pretends as if we
                        never
                        had that conversation, as if she hopes I‚Äôll forget about it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut now everything‚Äôs a mess!‚Äù Linh gestures to the ground, as if the argument
                        with
                        her parents were physical things just scattered below our feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all out there, but tangled
                        up,
                        messy, and&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">It‚Äôs out there</i>,‚Äù I try saying. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to lie
                        anymore.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">That‚Äôs not the right thing to say. I can tell by her face falling, her voice
                        turning dull. ‚ÄúI guess that was the actual problem for them. Lying. Me, lying. You saw it from
                        the
                        beginning.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt go there,‚Äù I counter as gently as possible. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a liar, I am
                        too. And parents blow up. They say things in the heat of the moment. I‚Äôve argued before with my
                        parents. You have too, probably.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNot like this, B·∫£o. Never like this.‚Äù She slides o the desk, sni ng and wiping
                        back stray tears, looking so defeated.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-244" class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt hurts, Linh. I know it does. But there‚Äôs always a way
                        out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Linh asks, an edge to her voice. ‚ÄúTell me how. Because I don‚Äôt think I
                        can
                        keep doing this, B·∫£o. Trying to defend what I‚Äôve been doing. And what we were about to do,
                        digging
                        into the past.‚Äù I read between the lines. Does she want to give up?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to know?‚Äù I ask, reaching for her hands. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want us?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She doesn‚Äôt move.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I never thought a nonresponse could hurt me so much. Not a word, but that
                        look on her face. Empty.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can keep doing this, B·∫£o.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre scared, Linh. I know you are.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúEver since we started <i class="calibre5">this</i>‚Ä¶ no, even met, I think, my
                        life
                        has been about putting one fire out after the next.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo, what? You think it‚Äôd be better if we‚Äôd never met? Never spoke to each
                        other
                        again?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The bell ringing to announce first period cuts through our silence.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 40</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Everyone is just about settled in class and any minute now a school aide will
                        start
                        her rounds, trying to catch kids playing hooky from class. The noise in each
                        classroom&mdash;chattering, laughing, the droning of a documentary&mdash;reaches me. I‚Äôm not
                        sure
                        where I‚Äôm going until I stop by rote.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali, to no surprise, sits at the front of her AP History class. She sees me
                        through
                        the door window, a smile ready on her face. She stops mid-wave. Then her hand shoots straight
                        up.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMrs. DuBois?‚Äù she says, the sound muted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, Allison.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCan I go to the bathroom?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you go before? We‚Äôre just about to&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù Ali bolts from her chair, swiping the bathroom pass from the
                        whiteboard‚Äôs
                        frame.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Out in the hall, she pulls me aside and lays her hands on my shoulders. ‚ÄúLinh?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And I just cry.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 41</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I‚Äôm not sure how long I stay seated in the classroom, but the period bell
                        ringing
                        makes me stand. I don‚Äôt feel like myself as I walk out, the teacher looking curiously after me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh doesn‚Äôt want us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Somehow I make it to another classroom, and only when Vi·ªát arrives do I realize
                        it‚Äôs Forensic Science today. He offers a packet of Orbit gum. When I don‚Äôt take it, that somehow
                        draws his concern. He waves his hand and I‚Äôm forced to look at him, really look at him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I might have spoken in sentence fragments. Or rambled on and on. Or shouted.
                        Not so
                        sure, but Vi·ªát listens the whole time. Today our teacher‚Äôs routine lateness is to our advantage,
                        and
                        our classmates are clumped together to one side, watching a YouTube video or something that
                        makes
                        them snicker now and again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you think she means it?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát chews his gum slowly. He plays with the corner of his worksheet, which was
                        filled out&mdash;reminding me that I left mine at home. Great.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt been rejected before. It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt
                        disappointed
                        my parents in some ways&mdash;and will continue to do so&mdash;for a lifetime. But I guess it
                        fucking sucks when I hear it from Linh.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I thought she saw something in me. And I wanted to believe in whatever she saw.
                        I
                        thought we would figure out the truth of us together.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Mr. Lynch enters the room, hungover by the looks of his mussed hair and
                        wrinkled
                        polo. He yawns a ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù while the other students snicker knowingly. I don‚Äôt care about
                        that.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-247" class="calibre12">I put my head down, feeling just exhausted.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt care about anything.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 42</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Doing as I was told, I skip work and head home, lying in bed, facedown, pillow
                        over
                        my head. I try to drown out my thoughts, my worries, scenes from last night and today pounding
                        inside my mind. I would have tried to take a nap, but my phone rings. Someone‚Äôs calling on
                        Viber.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, Linh,‚Äù D√¨ V√†ng says when the visual stabilizes, sounding like I was the
                        one to
                        call. She‚Äôs at an airport, sitting in a packed waiting area. Beside her is a nosy grandmother
                        who
                        stares suspiciously at my aunt, then looks away. ‚ÄúFive more hours until I land in Cali!‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I summon all of my energy into a smile and tell her how excited I am to finally
                        see her. I must look like something‚Äôs wrong because the next moment she leans in, squinting, and
                        asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Were you crying?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">What a way to welcome my aunt to the States after seven years.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Before I know it, I‚Äôm telling her everything that‚Äôs happened in the past few
                        months. It pours out of me. Maybe a screen separating us makes it easier for me to speak freely.
                        Or
                        maybe because D√¨ V√†ng looks a bit like my mom now, and I wish I could explain this all to her. I
                        start from the beginning&mdash;and for me, the real beginning was when B·∫£o crossed the street
                        because he saw I needed comfort. I start with <i class="calibre5">him</i>, not mentioning him as
                        the
                        son of my parents‚Äô nemeses or as the nephew of her former fianc√©, but the boy who offered to
                        help when
                        he didn‚Äôt have to. I tell her about him and his writing and my painting&mdash;how our
                        relationship
                        had formed and blossomed along with the art I‚Äôm finally making.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I tell my aunt about our meetups, and then our dates. About that happiness that
                        came in revealing my mural&mdash;that initial silence, then uproarious applause from strangers
                        who
                        loved what I‚Äôd put out there. And then I tell her about the moment things went wrong with my
                        parents, everything that I had hidden from them coming out and me having no real way to explain
                        myself.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-249" class="calibre12">I should have known where I would end up. I knew that
                        lying
                        was wrong, but I‚Äôd thought it was the only way to do the things that I wanted. Wasn‚Äôt it? I
                        finish my story with that question, one that my aunt needs to look away to ponder.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then she sighs and sips her co ee, which she got from Auntie Anne‚Äôs. ‚ÄúThis
                        doesn‚Äôt
                        sound good, Linh.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I say miserably.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot to take apart, but I think it‚Äôs the act of lying that hurt my
                        sister
                        the most. She loves you, Linh. And I don‚Äôt think she feels great about being left out of your
                        life.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to do that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, I know you didn‚Äôt,‚Äù she says sympathetically.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt mean to unload on you right before you even land here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI can think about it on the plane ride over.‚Äù She leans back in her seat. ‚ÄúSo
                        this
                        boy,‚Äù she says almost wistfully. ‚ÄúI remember being your age&mdash;what that was like.‚Äù She
                        smiles
                        quickly before it disappears. ‚ÄúFrom what it sounds like, this boy seems very <i
                            class="calibre5">ƒë√†ng ho√†ng</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I inhale. I‚Äôm on the precipice here, and once I say this, once I hear her
                        reaction,
                        I really can‚Äôt go back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something else I need to tell you. You know B·∫£o, kind of.
                        Because
                        you know his parents, or his mother. And his uncle. The one who died.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her lips part, the sun from the far-left window, facing the planes, touches her
                        face, obscuring her expression from me. <i class="calibre5">‚ÄúTr·ªùi ∆°i.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She knows. She remembers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The kiosk attendant starts calling people to board.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúD√¨ V√†ng&mdash;‚Äù I start to apologize, knowing that this thought will occupy
                        her
                        mind over the plane ride, and there won‚Äôt be anything she can do to stop it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So in shock, she only manages a goodbye before telling me she needs to step in
                        line. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been so long. But I guess we all have to face this, once and for all. I will see you
                        soon.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-250" class="calibre4"><img src="images/000040.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" />
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The drive is excruciating. A song plays in the background, the kind to lull me
                        and
                        Evie asleep during rare road trips. This was before M·∫π and Ba opened the restaurant, when their
                        work
                        hours were slightly more forgivable. We‚Äôd drive within California&mdash;to a park or to visit a
                        relative. In intermittent moments, my mom would reach her hand back and my sister or I,
                        giggling,
                        would put our hand in, asking her to guess whose it was.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúTay c·ªßa ai v·∫≠y?‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π would pretend to think, squeezing the hand, fingers, guessing whose hand
                        she‚Äôs
                        holding. Of course, my mom had the rearview mirror and could easily see who, but I thought it
                        was
                        just a superpower she had because she was a mom.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In the arrivals wing, my parents and I sit with three seats in between us.
                        Every
                        few minutes, Ba gets up to stretch his legs, then stand by the window, hands clasped, to observe
                        the
                        planes taking off. The area is alive with vibrant clothing and languages mingling and flying
                        right over
                        my head. The walls are wide and white, and tired passengers flow from the customs gate, their
                        dull
                        faces turning into laughter, surprise, eagerness as they reunite with their families. Then the
                        most
                        colorful person emerges&mdash;a woman with her hair piled atop her head, for convenience, rather
                        than looks. Her neck scarf, blouse, and pants show a bizarre spectrum of shades of green, pink,
                        and
                        yellow, though they all seem to mesh. She‚Äôs here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My aunt shrieks, causing the other off-loading passengers to look back at her,
                        some
                        with shock, some with amusement. Leaving her bag there momentarily&mdash;a woven bag that‚Äôs seen
                        better days&mdash;she and my mom, who‚Äôs suddenly come to life, embrace. Her hug is strong and
                        tight.
                        I feel it myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou look so skinny!‚Äù my aunt exclaims, squeezing my mom‚Äôs cheeks, shoulders,
                        hips,
                        but she bats her hands away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat are you wearing?‚Äù my mom asks dubiously, in the same way my sister asks
                        when
                        something doesn‚Äôt compute with her right away.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe latest Vietnamese fashion,‚Äù she retorts pompously. ‚ÄúI bought you the same
                        scarf.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-251" class="calibre12">‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll give it to Linh.‚Äù She turns to me, opens up
                        her
                        arms. ‚ÄúLook at you, all grown up! You‚Äôre so beautiful.‚Äù I stay there for a moment and I hear M·∫π
                        tell
                        Ba to pick up the bag D√¨ V√†ng left behind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt know why, but I start crying. Maybe I was exhausted by this energy in
                        the
                        house, by what I did to get us here, or that I didn‚Äôt expect my aunt to hold me for this long.
                        Or
                        that it would make me miss the way M·∫π used to hug me. My aunt‚Äôs arms tighten around me.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 43</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I‚Äôm glad that Vi·ªát is not someone to press me. He knows what‚Äôs happening with
                        Linh,
                        but he doesn‚Äôt force me to explain. Doesn‚Äôt tell me to stop moping. Just lets me deal with this
                        my
                        own way. At work, he keeps chattering on about his TV shows, not caring that I‚Äôm not listening
                        to
                        half the words. At school, in Forensic Science, he does most of the work, telling me to write
                        this
                        and that down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But one morning, I think he may have had enough. He‚Äôs calling my name as I‚Äôm
                        zoning
                        out, and when I don‚Äôt answer him right away, he punches me in the shoulder&mdash;the pain
                        jerking me
                        awake from my daze.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLook. Someone screenshotted these Yelp reviews.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I pull his laptop closer. It turns out Jared, the guy who accused my mom of
                        scamming him, had been making rounds, based on these online Yelp pro les all under di erent
                        names.
                        He was hitting several businesses with the same message:</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Fucking FOBS&mdash;if they‚Äôre going
                                to
                                open businesses here, they should speak in English, since they can‚Äôt</i></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">even do that, they should go back
                                to
                                where they belong.</i></span></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I click on my parents‚Äô restaurant. Similar message.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My rst thought? <i class="calibre5">Run-on sentence.</i> Then I hear Jared‚Äôs
                        self-righteous voice. It may or may not be him, but since he was the most recent person to say
                        things like this, my mind uses him as the person sitting in front of a PC, trolling because he
                        doesn‚Äôt have better things to do with his life. I see his wife hovering over his shoulder in
                        their
                        home somewhere, pleading for him not to hit that Post button, then walking away, shaking her
                        head,
                        when he fully ignores her.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-253" class="calibre12">Go back where? Where else would Linh‚Äôs parents go? My
                        parents? By now, half of their lives have been spent here. The country they remember is not the
                        one
                        that exists today. So why should they go when they so clearly belong here?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">This guy doesn‚Äôt know shit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs everywhere,‚Äù Vi·ªát says. He clicks through other names from our
                        neighborhood
                        shops. Nail salons, <i class="calibre5">b√°nh m√¨</i> places. Jared, or whoever it is, has really
                        been
                        hitting up every prominent Vietnamese place nearby.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you think a lot of people have seen this?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Vi·ªát just shrugs. ‚ÄúFor this douche‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs hope not.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The community did see it. Not through electronic means, but something more
                        reliable
                        for our parents: word of mouth. And who hears it rst? M·∫π‚Äôs group. Her circle, including Nhi
                        Tr∆∞ng,
                        convened in their booth, bickering quietly among themselves, printed pages of those reviews
                        spread
                        out across the table. M·∫π examines one of them, her glasses at the bridge of her nose. She
                        doesn‚Äôt
                        look happy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo you guys saw it too?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB·∫£o?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe reviews.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π purses her lips, answering my question. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre ridiculous. Racists.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Leaving the group, she strides to the back where Eddie, Tr·∫ßn, and others are
                        goo ng
                        around again. I don‚Äôt see Ba, until I realize he‚Äôs in the restaurant too, with the husbands.
                        They‚Äôve
                        come here about the review as well. In the kitchen, one of the line cooks wordlessly slides down
                        a
                        tin of Caf√© du Monde and M·∫π receives it smoothly, spooning it into a single-cup filter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúCon mu·ªën c√† ph√™ kh√¥ng?‚Äù</i> she asks breezily, and starts
                        making one for me before I can answer. I realize that this is the rst real one-on-one since our
                        argument a few weeks ago about Linh. We‚Äôre exactly where we were before. This time, I round the
                        prep
                        table, try to reason with her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre we going to do anything about the review?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-254" class="calibre12">My mom doesn‚Äôt answer me right away. Instead, she busies
                        herself with the filter, fiddling with the dripper, twisting it so that the drips run at the
                        right
                        pace.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My parents have never been the type to make a fuss. They save their comments
                        for
                        the kitchen after hours or the safety of our home. If their opinions are to be shared, they do
                        it
                        with others like them&mdash;Vietnamese who‚Äôve fled home for the same reasons, who read the same
                        newspapers about the home they once knew. I wonder if it‚Äôs because of what they‚Äôve gone through;
                        how
                        easily they could have been punished for speaking a word against the communist government. How
                        they
                        saw their friends and families punished for doing exactly that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It could all be that. But it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôll ever tell me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I try again. ‚ÄúThis review is ridiculous.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically talking shit about every business in our community! We need to
                        do
                        something.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy do you keep bothering? What can we do? Hm?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Her anger rises like a quick ame, knocking me o guard. And also because I don‚Äôt
                        have an answer. How can we ght someone who‚Äôs anonymous? Or the lies that they spread online
                        about
                        us?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat is it that Americans say? It‚Äôs not your battle.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I shake my head. An antithesis to basically everything she‚Äôs said to me my
                        whole
                        life. It‚Äôs always about us. Not one person&mdash;us. Together. And I‚Äôm not going to let her
                        start
                        saying things like that now.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThese words,‚Äù I slowly say. ‚ÄúThey have consequences. Yeah, sometimes, you
                        don‚Äôt
                        think they will do much, especially when they‚Äôre said among friends&mdash; within the safety of
                        one
                        place.‚Äù Her face shifts; she remembers our argument. ‚ÄúBut some words, like this, sometimes they
                        win.
                        We can‚Äôt let that happen. We can‚Äôt let anyone just see these words on our page and not defend
                        ourselves.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now my mom just looks tired, decades older than she really is.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let this person get away with saying things like that. I‚Äôm
                        not.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm tired.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-255" class="calibre12">Of all of it. Of all this useless gossip that never dies,
                        only comes back in different forms. Causes people to hide certain things, then when it comes out
                        it
                        hurts all of us at once.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Someone needs to finally say something in our defense. Even if it hurts.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Later that night, instead of sleeping, I‚Äôm up with the lamp on, my computer in
                        front
                        of me. Considering the blinking cursor for a few minutes, I place my fingers on the keyboard,
                        and
                        before I know it, words and sentences y from my</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">mind to the keys. With each word I type I‚Äôm hoping to erase the vile reviews
                        that
                        those shitheads left on our pages. I‚Äôm writing this for not just my family, but other
                        restaurants&mdash;and I pause&mdash;and the Mais‚Äô restaurant. As much as our restaurants have
                        clashed, as much as their weird battle has gone on, we still live in the same place. And hasn‚Äôt
                        Linh
                        always encouraged me to write what I feel? What I‚Äôm passionate about?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I sit up straight, stretching my back and arms. A look at the clock shows that
                        I‚Äôve
                        been typing for an hour. It‚Äôs the first long piece I‚Äôve written that wasn‚Äôt an assignment. It‚Äôs
                        me
                        on the page, and looking at it, I almost feel lighter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The rst person I want to share it with is Linh, but at the memory of our last
                        talk,
                        seeing her at her breaking point, my energy stills for a moment. That‚Äôs not an option, so I go
                        to
                        the next person I can trust.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I almost hesitate to show Ali the next day. Who knows what she‚Äôs thinking about
                        what
                        happened between me and Linh, whether she‚Äôll take Linh‚Äôs side and cold-shoulder me, too, because
                        that‚Äôs where her loyalty should be. But when I text her for help on the article during lunch,
                        she
                        sends back a quick ‚Äúyeah, sure,‚Äù telling me to nd her now in the newsroom like usual.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I pack my things from the lunch table and Vi·ªát sends me a quick nod. He‚Äôs been
                        my
                        friend for so long that he knows when to shut up. I haven‚Äôt heard <i class="calibre5">SVU</i>
                        recaps
                        from him in what seems like ages and I‚Äôve got to give his cross-country friends credit for
                        following
                        his lead, their conversation a little less boring than usual.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-256" class="calibre12">Then, because I can‚Äôt help it, I seek Linh out, wondering
                        if
                        she‚Äôll be here or in her art room, cooped up as usual. But she‚Äôs here, eating lunch with some
                        friends. I stare harder at her, willing her to turn around, to see me, but she doesn‚Äôt notice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Swallowing hard, I leave.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not bad?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNot bad so far.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHey, I said ‚Äòso far.‚Äô Your next sentence is probably going to be shitty.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôre quiet as she keeps reading as promised. I scroll through Twitter on the
                        computer. She marks up some words and nods sometimes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo Linh told me what happened. Well, kind of. Not the whole story. But she did

                    <p class="calibre12">My hand freezes on the mouse, but I keep quiet.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been really stressed. I mean, you know she probably didn‚Äôt mean any of
                        it?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali sits next to me, looking unusually somber. ‚ÄúSee, the thing with Linh is
                        that
                        she was alone for a while. Not physically, but alone inside her head. I‚Äôm a journalist and she‚Äôs
                        a
                        painter and though they‚Äôre both creative things, she never really had someone on that level with
                        her. But you, B·∫£o, you made her open up a little. Her art has changed. It‚Äôs transformed. It‚Äôs
                        been
                        freed.‚Äù Ali pauses. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen her that happy, and it‚Äôs because you walked into her life.
                        I‚Äôm
                        grateful for that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Words are stuck in my throat. This wasn‚Äôt what I expected when I came to Ali
                        for
                        help.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just talking about Linh who‚Äôs changed. You‚Äôve become the writer you‚Äôre
                        meant to be.‚Äù She nods, like she‚Äôs confirming the fact to herself.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-257" class="calibre12">‚ÄúDespite what‚Äôs happening, Linh‚Äôs just scared. Because it
                        <i class="calibre5">is</i> scary. Her world &mdash;both of your worlds&mdash;have been
                        upturned.‚Äù
                        Ali shrugs. ‚ÄúLet it settle a little. And don‚Äôt doubt what she feels for you. Or what you feel
                        for
                        her.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">After a few beats, Ali sti ens her back, morphing into the journalist I know
                        and am
                        terri ed of.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt ever repeat that to anyone,‚Äù she says, in her signature <i
                            class="calibre5">I will cut you</i> voice. Right after, she smiles. A genuine smile that
                        she‚Äôd
                        share only with Linh. ‚ÄúThis is great. I actually think it‚Äôs your best.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I say again, like a broken record.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo good,‚Äù she says, pushing herself o the counter, ‚Äúthat I think you should
                        try
                        for something bigger than just our newspaper. Because it‚Äôs not really about the school. It‚Äôs
                        about
                        the community. Your community. Your home. And if you need help with that, I have the right

                    <p class="calibre12">Hearing the word ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù come from her mouth still sounds ominous, but out
                        of

                        come

                        turns
                        to the woman, who slides a folded newspaper her way, a perfectly manicured finger pointing at

                    <p class="calibre12">My heart leaps at the praise. A stranger, complimenting me? ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù M·∫π
                        pauses,

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt was really touching. Those reviews were vile. I‚Äôve been here so many times

                    <p class="calibre12">After getting the woman settled into a booth, my mom takes the newspaper with
                        her
                        to the back, bringing along her grocery-store glasses. I wait tables all the while, my focus
                        split
                        between the back and the customers&mdash;many of whom have actually come by because of my
                        article,
                        to my shock.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">An hour later, M·∫π emerges from wherever she was, her glasses hanging by her
                        shirt
                        collar. She brings the newspaper back with her, but she doesn‚Äôt look for me. She takes her spot
                        by
                        the front desk, straight-backed, busying herself with the cash register. And I thought that this
                        was
                        it. The article was written. It‚Äôs out there.</p>

                        about
                        what I wrote. Before I can get a word out, she speaks.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">A few minutes later, after getting back to work, I look back and see M·∫π holding

                        the newspaper against the wall, like she‚Äôs checking to see how it‚Äôll look.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The next day, there <i class="calibre5">is</i> a framed picture of my article
                        hanging on our wall of fame: articles about the restaurant when it rst opened, the great reviews
                        that have come in. My mom probably pulled in a favor with friends to get it made so quickly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">According to Ali, the article has gone viral, shared by local news sites. She
                        had
                        that gleam in her eyes when she explained: ‚ÄúThey love underdog stories, you know. People
                        fighting
                        back against assholes like this guy.‚Äù And because of the reach, we‚Äôre getting more and more
                        customers, even from outside Bolsa.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">There‚Äôs a small collective of people in our community taking it upon themselves
                        to
                        look out for future racist incidents&mdash;online and in real time. Walking into work one day, I
                        see
                        my mom‚Äôs friends crowded around someone‚Äôs laptop, systematically scrolling through old reviews
                        to
                        report them. The General, ironically, might have established herself as the leader.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I can‚Äôt be sure that this will help stop the gossip wars, but it‚Äôs still a
                        welcome
                        change. And it was one article that started it. Mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">At school only the kids whose parents run businesses in the area paid attention
                        to
                        the news&mdash;and I didn‚Äôt realize that it was actually a lot of people. Some classmates came
                        by to
                        high- ve me or say ‚ÄúNice article‚Äù and things like that. Lunchtime surprised me too: Apparently
                        Vi·ªát
                        looped in some of his cross-country friends into the whole deal, and they were nice about it,
                        joking
                        around about me being famous now. Even Steve was so curious that he forgot about his banana.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I tried to look for Linh. Not that I would know what to say, but I wanted to
                        know
                        if she read what I wrote. If she knew that I, in my own way, was reaching out.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-262" class="calibre12">There are flyers now showcasing the upcoming Art Fair, so
                        Linh‚Äôs picture is verywhere that‚Äôs eye level. I want to tell her how happy I am for her, really.
                        Even though she doesn‚Äôt seem to want to talk to me anymore.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali‚Äôs become my pseudo-publicist, in a way. When a local station wanted to
                        interview me on camera for a brief segment, she demanded that they send her the questions for
                        approval. I‚Äôm 100 percent sure that she added some questions that would involve me mentioning
                        the
                        school newspaper and my role in it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening now as I‚Äôm in front of the restaurant, fiddling
                        with
                        the collar of my dress shirt that my mom forced me to wear. ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">ƒê·∫πp trai</i>,‚Äù
                        she
                        said this morning when inspecting me, ultimately approving the look. My dad let me borrow his
                        belt
                        for my pants.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The female news anchor prepping me reminds me not to move so much because the
                        microphone is sensitive and will pick up extraneous noise.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou have to zoom out,‚Äù I hear Ali telling Tim, the cameraman. A professional.
                        ‚ÄúJust like&mdash;yeah, there it is. Perfect.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúKid, I know.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">After the countdown, I can‚Äôt even hear myself talking. I just see the host
                        nodding
                        intently, and her mouth forming words, then she addresses my parents directly. They keep
                        shifting
                        behind me, uncomfortable, fidgeting in the spotlight.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou must be so proud of your son,‚Äù the reporter finally says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I almost chime in, wanting to tell her, ‚ÄúWell, that might be a stretch.‚Äù But my
                        mother answers rst. She looks directly at me and nods silently, seriously. It makes me stand
                        straighter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course I am proud. All of this makes me wonder how he turned out like
                        this.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt was all because of me,‚Äù Dad says from the other side. His joking side has
                        come
                        out, though the reporter looks confused, not sure if he‚Äôs serious, so she just laughs nervously.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Finally, she signs off and the record light dims. I guess I <i
                            class="calibre5">did</i> do okay&mdash;or maybe my eyes are screaming <i class="calibre5">I
                            SUCK!</i> and she just feels bad for me&mdash;because the interviewer shakes my hand,
                        telling
                        me, ‚ÄúGood job,‚Äù before telling her coworkers to pack up.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-263" class="calibre4"><img src="images/000047.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" />
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Later, when all the cameras have gone and customers have dwindled enough that
                        everyone can catch their breath, I spy my dad Windex-ing my framed article, even though I‚Äôm sure
                        it‚Äôs already spotless. He steps back to inspect his work.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba notices me a beat later. <i class="calibre5">‚ÄúG√¨?‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù I fight back a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Ba says. ‚ÄúGet back to work. Stop being so lazy.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I happen to look up, out to the Mais‚Äô restaurant. It looks as busy as it was
                        when I
                        rst crossed the street, rst had the courage to speak to Linh. It‚Äôs busy, too, perhaps because of
                        the
                        article, but that‚Äôs not what caught my eye.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I saw a movement from behind the window.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A flash of long dark brown hair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I miss her.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 44</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I miss him. There are so many things I want to tell B·∫£o after reading his
                        letter.
                        I‚Äôm so proud of him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">I wish I could be like you.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">You‚Äôre speaking the truth, without worrying about
                            consequences.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But I‚Äôm ashamed of how I ran away&mdash;not just from our last conversation,
                        but
                        before. It was him always having to pull a oat, reminding me that I can‚Äôt hide from problems.
                        Because it‚Äôll build up and bury me until I can‚Äôt breathe.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The house is made less tense with D√¨ V√†ng‚Äôs arrival. The past few nights have
                        been
                        light and fun, full of laughter. It was almost as if the argument in the kitchen never happened.
                        But
                        take her presence away and we‚Äôre back to square one between my parents and me. Terse. Cold.
                        Punishing. D√¨ V√†ng has been visiting friends in Washington&mdash;perhaps even B√°c Xu√¢n&mdash;and
                        she
                        comes home late, or not at all, staying at her friends‚Äô places. She‚Äôll have to leave again and
                        miss
                        my exhibition at the Art Fair in a couple of days.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But the one night D√¨ V√†ng does stay, she comes to me to talk. She‚Äôs just
                        showered
                        and is dressed in pale green pajamas. My drawers are packed with similar clothing, gifts from
                        her
                        across the years. Her long hair rests on her left shoulder in a beautiful clean braid and she‚Äôs
                        peering closely at the artwork above my desk. Her eyes linger on B·∫£o‚Äôs sculpture of whatever
                        from
                        our rst date and she tilts her head in puzzlement before moving on. It was shipped here a couple
                        of
                        days ago.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou are just as talented as your mom always tells me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I say quietly, suddenly nervous. I‚Äôm still adjusting to seeing her
                        in
                        person&mdash;unpixelated and in real time.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-265" class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying. Your mom‚Äôs so proud of you. Your dad is,
                        too,
                        but you know how it is; he says it from the background.‚Äù She throws a grin over her shoulder as
                        she
                        pulls back the bedcovers and slips in, looking right at home. Far from sleeping, my aunt props
                        her
                        head up. ‚ÄúIs everything okay now? Since we last spoke.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I pause. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no change.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She stretches her hand toward me and I reach for her, the space between us only
                        an
                        illusion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHas M·∫π said anything to you?‚Äù I ask hopefully. She shakes her head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I stare at the ceiling for a moment, listening to the low hum of the air
                        conditioner turning on, the hush of sprinklers in our lawn. A car passes by, headlights shining
                        into
                        the room before disappearing. I want to ask about B·∫£o‚Äôs uncle, but she‚Äôs not offering to tell me
                        herself. Does she want to ignore it too?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI will tell you everything, Linh,‚Äù she says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look at her in surprise. She must have read my mind.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI will, I promise. But I have to sort things out, too. My sister doesn‚Äôt even
                        know
                        that I know, so just give me some time. It‚Äôll all come out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B√°c Xu√¢n had said the same thing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π always talked about you like you‚Äôre some sort of tragedy. Like your art was
                        a
                        punishment.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI was in a bad way after all that happened. But what my sister doesn‚Äôt
                        understand‚Ä¶‚Äù D√¨ V√†ng pauses. ‚ÄúOr maybe, one day, what you can <i class="calibre5">help</i> her
                        understand, is that for people like us, sadness is part of our inspiration. Others might bottle
                        up
                        their sadness and pour it out on certain occasions, but we let it pour from us and into our
                        medium.
                        It‚Äôs the same for most emotions, and we do it so that we can make room for more.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I nod, remembering how my art was the only thing to calm me when things with my
                        parents and B·∫£o were collapsing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She then adds softly, ‚ÄúWe all lost something precious during that time.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4"><img src="images/000048.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-266" class="calibre1">I think Ba has grown tired of the tension between me and
                        my
                        mom, despite D√¨ V√†ng being there to cut through it all. Now she‚Äôs o visiting a friend in San
                        Francisco, scheduled to come back later this week. Ba‚Äôs kind of annoyance takes only a day or
                        two,
                        much like when he sprained his back. But whether it‚Äôs the food, or the silence, or being
                        in-between,
                        I won‚Äôt ever figure out why Ba shows up outside my bedroom as I type out the captions to my Art
                        Fair
                        display. Just a few more days to go. Ba doesn‚Äôt come in, like my mom; instead he hovers, like
                        he‚Äôs
                        waiting for my permission to enter.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHomework?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúKind of.‚Äù A half-truth, not a full lie. His attention is on the paper in front
                        me,
                        the scraps on the oor as well.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCome eat. I made soup. <i class="calibre5">Canh s∆∞·ªùn b√≠</i>.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His signature, bland dish.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π‚Äôs not coming home?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWorking late,‚Äù he says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I guess even if he were mad, he wouldn‚Äôt starve me. Without another word, Ba
                        turns
                        left, back toward the kitchen, where he‚Äôs already set the table. Two bowls are stacked on top of
                        each other by the rice cooker. He u s the rice with chopsticks, but doesn‚Äôt ll the bowls. I sit
                        down, sensing he doesn‚Äôt want me here just to eat. Maybe he wants to tell me again how
                        disappointed
                        he is, and I feel my stomach drop.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba settles in his usual seat. One of the light bulbs above us is dead, washing
                        the
                        top of Ba‚Äôs head in a dim glow. It highlights his white hairs&mdash;he has so many these days.
                        And
                        it doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs shaved, the hair on his chin appearing as if it‚Äôs just sponged-on
                        black
                        paint.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π and Ba are disappointed, con,‚Äù he starts. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt think we would raise a
                        daughter who would lie to us so much. Lie and think we wouldn‚Äôt figure it out.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I bite my lip, thinking of how I tried to argue with M·∫π and how poorly that
                        turned
                        out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt is not just that: disappointment. You hurt us.‚Äù I shift in my seat now,
                        unaccustomed to hearing that word from him. Come to think of it, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever heard it
                        said here. The concept is unfathomable&mdash;how could Ba be hurt? He‚Äôs always so forceful, so
                        set
                        in his ways. One of those Roman marble sculptures that miraculously never chip.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-267" class="calibre12">I whisper at his pause. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I repeat it in
                        Vietnamese, though it doesn‚Äôt seem to register with him because he says right away:</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut a part of me wonders. Ba and M·∫π should have noticed more why you were
                        acting
                        strangely. Noticed that you looked‚Ä¶ sadder than we are used to. I noticed that right here, in
                        this
                        kitchen that night.‚Äù He gestures to the spot where I‚Äôd been. He leans forward. ‚Äú<i
                            class="calibre5">Ba kh√¥ng mu·ªën</i> con be sad.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">I don‚Äôt want you to be sad</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut you are happy here.‚Äù It‚Äôs then that I notice Ba had something in his other
                        hand. A clipping of a newsletter, the kind that businesses pass around door to door, and it had
                        the
                        photo of me and B·∫£o that someone had texted. Was that only two weeks ago? The Linh there is
                        proud,
                        proud of herself, and also happy in B·∫£o‚Äôs arms as they look on at the mural, her work, her art.
                        Ba‚Äôs
                        right. I was happy.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">But why is he showing this to me now? Will he say something about B·∫£o? There‚Äôs
                        no
                        denying what we are in this pic. Instead, he seems to be ignoring him, literally putting him out

                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLike D√¨ V√†ng,‚Äù I whisper, recalling my mom‚Äôs words repeated over and over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He shakes his head. ‚ÄúLike we did. <i class="calibre5">Khi Ba t·ªõi n∆∞·ªõc n√†y</i>,‚Äù
                        he
                        starts, before switching to English. ‚ÄúWhen I came here, my English was not good. Still isn‚Äôt
                        good.
                        But back in Vietnam, I could stand in front of a classroom and speak without fear. My teachers
                        told
                        me I would be a great businessman. That I would make everyone broke because everyone would want
                        to
                        buy whatever I sold!‚Äù He smiles at the memory, proud. ‚ÄúAfter escaping, after coming here, I
                        wanted
                        to try that. I wanted to try marketing and advertising because it was something I loved to do,
                        and
                        before you were born, I went to school for it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A thought tickles my brain, and I go searching for it, finding it in a few
                        seconds.
                        In the box of photos, there was one showing Ba in a classroom. Maybe it was from that time? I
                        knew
                        Ba didn‚Äôt have a degree, but I didn‚Äôt know that he tried for it.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-268" class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut because of my English, I sounded unpolished in
                        presentations. I couldn‚Äôt speak to even my classmates. It was hard, and I started to hate it. I
                        started to hate doing what I loved to do, which I never thought would happen.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know other people could have moved on despite this. Your mother is someone
                        who
                        would, because she is strong. I wasn‚Äôt. And then Evelyn was born. And then you were born, and
                        there
                        was no more time for school. We had too much to worry about. We had to survive.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I reach for his hand. A strange sense of understanding comes over me. He went
                        after
                        what he loved to do and couldn‚Äôt do it, or finish it, as hard as he tried. But that didn‚Äôt mean
                        he
                        was a failure.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou can go back to school. There‚Äôs time.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba waves away the suggestion. ‚ÄúI am happy at the restaurant now. In a way, I
                        still
                        do marketing and advertising.‚Äù Like the ph·ªü specials and how every time a new customer comes in
                        he
                        ashes his smile, his charisma. ‚ÄúBut I am scared for you, con.‚Äù Another word I don‚Äôt often hear
                        from
                        Ba. ‚ÄúArt will be a hard life.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hold my breath.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Will</i>. He might not know the signifocance&mdash;maybe he

                    <p class="calibre15">rst time I heard it as a possibility.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I grab on to it, squeezing his hand. ‚ÄúBa, I know it will always be hard. But I
                        <i class="calibre5">can</i> do this. I <i class="calibre5">am</i> doing this, now.‚Äù I remember
                        his
                        words before, about how other people might have continued, unlike him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I‚Äôm <i

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOf course con strong. You are Linh Mai,‚Äù he answers quickly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I smile faintly. ‚ÄúI want to do this. I <i class="calibre5">can</i> do this. I
                        know
                        I can. Because I have you and‚Ä¶ M·∫π. You guys did the surviving for me and Evie,‚Äù I say, bringing
                        up
                        his words from before. I wonder if M·∫π feels this way as well, and maybe that is why she‚Äôs never
                        seen
                        art as a path for me. She is scared, too, her own history tinged with so many struggles in
                        Vietnam
                        and after. It might be with her forever.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I know if I close my eyes now, I will see M·∫π, in this kitchen, tears in her
                        eyes. I
                        see her at my age, when she came here, when she didn‚Äôt have what I have now, which is
                        opportunity.
                        All because of them.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBa, all the struggles that you went through. You‚Äôve surpassed them. Now you
                        just
                        deserve to live.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-269" class="calibre12">Ba glances at the table, blinking. Holding back tears.
                        I‚Äôve
                        never seen him cry, and I don‚Äôt think I will, but to see him this close unleashes my tears. I
                        fall
                        apart; I understand, now, just a bit more of what he‚Äôs gone through, mourning his life that he
                        never
                        got to really have. He‚Äôs tired. We sit there, hand in hand for a few minutes, until I feel Ba‚Äôs
                        squeeze.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDoes it really make you happy? Painting?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">I laugh now, shaking my head so that my tears fall to the table. ‚ÄúDefinitely

                        I
                        got as a child whenever I‚Äôd cry after getting yelled at. I rush down the hall to the bathroom,
                        splash cold water on my face, and glance into the mirror. The redness is still there, but I feel
                        di
                        erent.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">For the rst time in weeks, I‚Äôm a bit lighter.</p>

                        tasting
                        it. ‚ÄúNo salt.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba tsks his tongue. ‚ÄúYou try cooking it, and we‚Äôll see how well you do.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Our chopsticks hit the insides of our bowls, us eating our meal quietly,
                        comfortably, even. When Ba finishes his rst bowl, he sets it down.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat boy across the street from us. The one who wrote the article that

                    <p class="calibre12">I take a large gulp, hoping that we‚Äôre not going to head into another argument,
                        because that would break me. I nod.</p>

                        comes
                        back, the corners of my eyes prickling. It‚Äôs not only Mom I‚Äôll need to apologize to, but also

                        more
                        often than Ba, he merely returns to his meal. A part of me wonders if he‚Äôs realized that he‚Äôs
                        never
                        showed me this much emotion, so he may be reaching his limit in one night.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">Things at home are not much better, but not worse. A plan came just at dawn, at
                        breakfast, watching my mom cut coupons and my dad read the crime section of the paper. Ba has
                        been
                        trying to cool M·∫π down, smooth things over between us, but my mom‚Äôs stubborn.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Every cold shoulder, every glance past me, hurts me more than I realize. Maybe
                        I
                        can‚Äôt x that right away. I did lie to her. But there‚Äôs something else I can try xing now, and
                        maybe
                        some good will come out of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I stop just before the front facade of B·∫£o‚Äôs restaurant. Suddenly the alley

                        Unsure of his reaction&mdash;if he‚Äôll just ignore me&mdash;I feel relief coursing through me
                        when

                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt move. That‚Äôs the last thing I want to do, but I don‚Äôt say that.

                    <p class="calibre12">Something lets up in his eyes. And he nods, as if saying, <i

                        the wall. ‚ÄúIt was really nice of him to defend our community.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt was good, yes.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so good at writing. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre proud of him.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-272" class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd you know he writes?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre friends. We‚Äôd never spoken to each other before until this year and
                        we‚Äôve
                        become‚Ä¶ close.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFriends.‚Äù Her eyes widen like someone learning what it means for the rst time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù <i class="calibre5">There, that‚Äôs out in the open.</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnyway, what he did meant a lot. That he‚Äôd write something nice about our
                        family.
                        I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ pretend to know what happened. To make you hate us‚Äù&mdash;I rush through my words when
                        I
                        see her open her mouth&mdash;‚Äúand I know I‚Äôm not a part of it, and that‚Äôs ne and all. I don‚Äôt
                        think
                        my parents would even want me here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I breathe out. ‚ÄúBut they were glad to have someone defend them. It meant a lot.
                        So‚Ä¶
                        thank you.‚Äù I take a step forward, but B·∫£o‚Äôs mother doesn‚Äôt back away or anything. I unroll the
                        paper I‚Äôd worked on, slowly. I feel her gaze on me, taking stock of me, unsure why I‚Äôm even
                        here.
                        ‚ÄúIt was so nice of B·∫£o, especially since‚Ä¶‚Äù I gulp&mdash;no need to give her another reason to
                        kick
                        me out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It feels like a weird dream being here. It‚Äôs just me and her. Like me and B·∫£o,
                        we‚Äôve existed in the same place, a few feet away, and now we‚Äôre here in front of each other.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I glance at the wall that B·∫£o had brought up in some of our conversations. ‚ÄúI
                        want
                        to do something for you. You see, I‚Äôm a painter.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAn artist?‚Äù she asks numbly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I tilt my head, not expecting that reaction. It sounds like she‚Äôs in disbelief.
                        ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs kind of how me and B·∫£o rst started working together. And I had a vision for this
                        wall.
                        It‚Äôs beautiful as it is, with all the photos, but I wonder&mdash;‚Äù I bite my lip before
                        unfurling
                        the paper fully.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Essentially it‚Äôs a mural I‚Äôm proposing. One of Nha Trang from a bird‚Äôs-eye
                        view.
                        The waters, the streets crowded with motorcycles. An ode to where they‚Äôd come from. They‚Äôd keep
                        the
                        picture frames, but it‚Äôd be like the faces in the landscape. A nice reminder of the
                        past&mdash;even
                        though it wasn‚Äôt all that nice. As I gesture to different parts of the mural, I‚Äôm hyperaware of
                        her
                        hands, slightly pink like they were just washed under warm water.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to do it for you one day.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù she asks, incredulous.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-273" class="calibre12">‚ÄúB·∫£o told me the next thing you wanted for the restaurant
                        was
                        a new wall.‚Äù My voice trembles. ‚ÄúHe really loves you. You‚Äôre his mom.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm just babbling, so
                        I
                        summon my remaining courage. ‚ÄúI want to apologize to B·∫£o, but I don‚Äôt know how. He‚Äôs the most
                        honest
                        person out there, more honest than me. Because he cares. Because he‚Äôs special. He means a lot to
                        me.‚Äù I break o before I start to get too emotional. I put on a brave face, starting to back
                        away.
                        ‚ÄúAnyway, thank you for your time. And please let me know if I can help in the future.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you tell him all of this yourself?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I smile sadly. ‚ÄúBecause he was right: I‚Äôm still scared.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 45</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The door rings in the next customer and I say hello without looking, counting a
                        customer‚Äôs change before handing it over. ‚ÄúThanks for coming by.‚Äù Plastering another smile on my
                        face, I focus on the newcomer, only to realize it‚Äôs not a regular customer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs Linh‚Äôs father. Years of spotting him by the window looking out at us, of
                        his
                        pro le just before disappearing into his store, tells me it‚Äôs him. He stands with his arms
                        crossed
                        behind his back&mdash;Vietnamese style. I instantly sense disapproval from him&mdash;as if
                        Vietnamese fathers underwent the same aura training before having children&mdash;but it‚Äôs more
                        of a
                        gut reaction than anything else.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúT√™n con l√† B·∫£o?‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">‚ÄúD·∫°. Ch√†o, B√°c.‚Äù</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He nods. Probably noticing how atrocious my Vietnamese is but accepting my
                        attempt,
                        at least. His eyes sweep the room, and my mom‚Äôs panicked voice sounds choked up inside my brain,
                        <i class="calibre5">Why is he here?!</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He switches over to English. ‚ÄúYour article is very good.‚Äù He holds out the
                        latest
                        edition of <i class="calibre5">Ng∆∞·ªùi Vi·ªát</i> where it‚Äôs folded to show my op-ed. ‚ÄúAnd you
                        defended
                        us well.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Us</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you a writer?‚Äù he asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">If I answered <i class="calibre5">I think so</i>, he‚Äôd probably think even less
                        of
                        me. ‚ÄúYes, I am. I‚Äôm thinking of doing it in college.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He shakes the newspaper at me&mdash;not in a threatening way, thank God. ‚ÄúI
                        think
                        it would be very good for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-275" class="calibre12">‚ÄúTh-thank you,‚Äù I manage to get out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Again the silence falls heavily and I try not to squirm under his scrutiny. I
                        wonder if he knows I was seeing Linh before everything blew up.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou are Linh‚Äôs friend.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs not going to stop just because of the argument. At least, I hope. ‚ÄúI am‚Ä¶
                        Do
                        you want to talk to my parents or‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">His face changes. ‚ÄúNo, no.‚Äù He shakes his head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let them know I was
                        here.‚Äù A
                        corner of his lips turns up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get in trouble.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Ah, the terror of Vietnamese wives.</i> I just nod and wave
                        as
                        Linh‚Äôs father backs out, hurrying across the street so quickly that I must have hallucinated his
                        entire visit. I don‚Äôt know how long I stand there, watching the restaurant across from us,
                        mirroring
                        my dad‚Äôs own surveillance stance. Is it possible that my article managed to bridge some gap? Can
                        forgiveness be born from this?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I dip my hand into my back pocket, brushing up against the folded-up flyer for
                        the
                        Art Fair. I hold on to it as I cross the street.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 46</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I snuck out for the Art Fair. No, that wasn‚Äôt exactly it. My parents had to have
                        known I was leaving. I made noise walking down the hallway, made sure my keys jangled loud
                        enough,
                        before shutting the door. All done to see if they would say anything. But there was nothing.
                        Them
                        not monitoring where I‚Äôm going is so much worse.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The auditorium isn‚Äôt filled to capacity like it is for sports events, but when
                        I
                        walk in, I‚Äôm surprised by the number of people here for the Art Fair. But farther in the back,
                        ribboned o &mdash;dramatic!&mdash;is my display. I see some other classmates, like Eric and
                        Spencer,
                        exhibiting their art.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Spending so much time nose-to-canvas, obsessing over the littlest details, I
                        forget
                        to see the whole picture. I forget what everything looks like when it‚Äôs all put together. And
                        now,
                        easel set up like this, I feel like I can see a story.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I did all of this. Everything here I can call mine. Despite being alone
                        tonight,
                        I‚Äôm latching on to this.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever smiled so much. As I wait for people to come by, I
                        reread
                        my statement. I had Ali look at it, but what I really wanted was for B·∫£o to see it. He was
                        always
                        good at things like that. But it‚Äôs my fault that I can‚Äôt, I know that. I pushed him away, hurt
                        him.
                        And now I‚Äôm paying for it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The compliments are nice and heart-warming, but temporary. My smile fades once
                        each
                        exhibitor leaves my display. I watch a classmate and his parents pose for some pictures. His
                        dads
                        look so proud of him. I turn around, fighting back a burning sensation in the back of my eyes. I
                        wish M·∫π and Ba could be here, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to mention the fair, even if Ba is
                        starting to come around to my art. I wish I could have told the truth from the very beginning.
                        Maybe
                        then they‚Äôd be proud enough to be here, just this one time, for me.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-277" class="calibre12">Soon enough, the Art Fair crowd has dwindled, people are
                        leaving, and some other artists are already taking down their canvases, to store here or bring
                        home.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh!‚Äù I see Ali‚Äôs curly hair before her face. She squeezes me to death,
                        rambling
                        about how proud she is of me. ‚ÄúTotal masterpieces! How are you feeling?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She‚Äôll be worried if I answer honestly: that I feel alone and I can‚Äôt seem to
                        stop
                        it, even if everyone‚Äôs responding well to my artwork. The people whose opinions matter the most‚Ä¶
                        just aren‚Äôt here.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Offering me some comfort, whether she knows it or not, Yamamoto quickly passes
                        by,
                        squeezing me tight, whispering about how proud she is of me. That if I don‚Äôt get the Gold Key
                        scholarship, she‚Äôll visit their headquarters, wherever they are, and protest.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I force a smile, which fades as I spot <i class="calibre5">him</i>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I think I say hello or some version of it, right as he does the same. He‚Äôs
                        stumbling over his words now before he finally stops himself, fixated on the</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">oor. Will it be like this from now on?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou look nice. Professional,‚Äù I offer.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI needed to impress someone.‚Äù A smile plays on his lips. My heart leaps at his
                        answer but I try not to show it, waiting. Then I notice the bouquet that he‚Äôs offering me
                        sheepishly. ‚ÄúI heard about your mural idea. My mom told me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I accept the flowers. ‚ÄúShe was really shocked when I came by.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe could barely speak. That‚Äôs not a common thing.‚Äù He pauses before turning
                        to my
                        paintings. ‚ÄúSo, tell me about them.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He‚Äôs not walking away. He‚Äôs here and his presence gives me a small semblance of
                        hope. In this moment, it‚Äôs enough. I slip my hand into his, relishing in his warmth, and pull
                        him
                        toward my work. The earliest of them depicts a common scene from my childhood, me waiting for my
                        parents to finish prepping for the next day. I painted my ten-year-old self into a booth,
                        preoccupied with blowing bubbles into my water. M·∫π has popped her head out from the serving
                        window
                        and is likely trying to talk to Ba, who‚Äôs at the front desk.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-278" class="calibre12">I show them my family restaurant‚Äôs facade, that night Ph·ªü
                        Day
                        ended with a success. I tried to infuse the contentment I felt at seeing M·∫π‚Äôs face through the
                        yellow haze of the streetlights shining down, the glistening of puddles left from the storm.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I lead B·∫£o to my painting of the art room the rst time he visited me. An
                        idyllic
                        scene, the afternoon light streaming from the window, touching the desks and stools, and my back
                        as
                        I faced the canvas. I painted in B·∫£o‚Äôs backpack and a hint of his shoes peeking out as one table
                        blocked the view of his body.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">These memories grew out of me over time and in the last few weeks. The act of
                        painting them is now a blur; I was so focused on my canvas that I barely kept track of time.
                        Maybe
                        because I‚Äôd never desired more to escape. Seeing my paintings now, displayed like this, is
                        somewhat
                        of an out-of-body experience, but it‚Äôs also hollow. I wish my parents could see them, too, see
                        how
                        much my art and my life with them, here, are so deeply intertwined that it‚Äôs no longer about
                        trying
                        to undo these ties.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The concept of me being an artist <i class="calibre5">without</i> them doesn‚Äôt
                        exist.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I peek at B·∫£o‚Äôs reaction as he leans forward to study the details of the art
                        room.
                        He still hasn‚Äôt let go. I realize that my hands, despite the hard scrubbing, still show residues
                        of
                        paint. But the sight of it against his clean skin is comforting. Normal.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI thought I knew what you were capable of, but this is beyond that. I don‚Äôt
                        think
                        I can pick a favorite. I love all of it.‚Äù He‚Äôs looking at me now, and perhaps it‚Äôs foolish hope
                        that
                        makes me spot a familiar wistful gleam in his eyes. The kind he‚Äôd send me before bringing me in
                        for
                        a kiss, before brushing aside a strand of my hair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And I know I should just say it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, B·∫£o. More sorry than I can ever
                        express. The mural was just one attempt to try to make up for what I said.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLinh, you don‚Äôt have to&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYour article was honest&mdash;the exact opposite of the way I‚Äôd been acting. I
                        was
                        scared of telling my parents the truth. So I lied, and those lies just kept piling up. I hurt
                        you. I
                        hurt them, and now&mdash;this, while it‚Äôs all that I can ever dream of&mdash;it just feels
                        empty.‚Äù I
                        gesture to the paintings behind me, with colors and emotions that were painted, in a way, for
                        them.
                        ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really celebrate because I hurt so many people to get here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-279" class="calibre12">He stops trying to protest, bringing his arms around me.
                        I
                        don‚Äôt understand how much I needed his full touch until my nose is pressed up against his
                        shoulders
                        and comforted by his familiar scent. ‚ÄúI was hurting. I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with all the
                        secrets
                        coming up. But I lied to you, B·∫£o. I want us. I‚Äôve always wanted us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI think I knew that. At least, I hoped what I was thinking was right.‚Äù He
                        leans
                        back slightly to catch my eye, his thumb caressing my cheek.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThank you for being brave, B·∫£o Nguy·ªÖn.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAhem.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali, surprising me, hugs the two of us from behind. ‚ÄúFinally, Romeo and Juliet
                        are
                        back together. I thought you‚Äôd be mad at me for letting him see you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLetting me?‚Äù B·∫£o asks, but Ali ignores him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut I have to admit, these past few weeks have brought me and this guy closer.
                        If
                        we paired together, we could really change the newspaper-making business.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hold back a laugh at B·∫£o‚Äôs grimace, which Ali can‚Äôt see since she‚Äôs facing
                        away
                        from him. Yet that laughter turns into confusion when she asks him, ‚ÄúAre they outside?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI was getting there.‚Äù He‚Äôs almost‚Ä¶ shy? ‚ÄúLinh, I know there are important
                        people
                        you want to be here, who are missing here. But they‚Äôre not, not right now.‚Äù B·∫£o tilts his head,
                        gestures to the exit. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre outside.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat&mdash;‚Äù <i class="calibre5">They?</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Who‚Ä¶ ?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I leave a trail of flower petals as I dash out of the auditorium, down the long
                        streak of hallway with loitering parents and younger siblings amusing themselves with whatever
                        they
                        can touch. I nd my aunt at the very end of it, alone. She welcomes me with a smile.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúD√¨ V√†ng!‚Äù I y into her arms and she returns my hug with a deep chuckle. Her
                        shoulder purse slides off and falls to the ground.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSurprised?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShocked. How&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-280" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWell, I was always planning to come. The thing about
                        visiting a friend&mdash;that was a lie. I wanted to surprise you.‚Äù She looks at a point over my
                        shoulder. When I follow her gaze, I don‚Äôt see anyone. I pivot, confused. ‚ÄúThat was him, wasn‚Äôt
                        it?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Not finding the right words, I merely nod.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the spitting image of his uncle.‚Äù She says this lightly, but there‚Äôs a
                        whole
                        story behind her eyes. What she‚Äôd already told me was likely only half of it.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She shakes the look away and pushes me gently out of her arms. She steers me to
                        face the exit. ‚ÄúWhat&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúGo. Some important people are waiting just outside for you. I‚Äôll meet you back
                        inside. Apparently there‚Äôs a superstar who‚Äôs displayed her work here. Be the brave, honest
                        person
                        that I know you are.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My steps outside are far more hesitant. The scent of cigarettes clings to the
                        cool
                        air. They‚Äôve dressed up. My dad with his polo neatly tucked into his belted dress pants. He
                        stands
                        with his back to me, arms crossed behind him, head tipped back like he‚Äôs watching for a sign
                        from
                        the sky. Next to him is my mom, always favoring softer oral patterns, in a red-and-white
                        knee-length
                        dress that I‚Äôve never seen her wear.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs possible that she bought it just for tonight‚Äôs exhibition&mdash;and the
                        thought makes me hopeful.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBa. M·∫π.‚Äù I clutch the flowers to my chest. They‚Äôre ruined by now. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt
                        think
                        you‚Äôd come.‚Äù My steps toward them seem unusually disruptive and it‚Äôs only because my parents are
                        so
                        quiet and still. Such lifelike statues.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know this was happening until today. Con didn‚Äôt say anything
                        directly.‚Äù
                        Accusation rings clear in her voice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo how did you know to be here?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSomeone slipped a yer under our door,‚Äù Ba explains evenly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Someone</i>. ‚ÄúAli?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Ba says. He stares unblinkingly, but doesn‚Äôt say anything. Now‚Äôs the
                        time
                        he‚Äôs going to try for subtle? What could he‚Ä¶ ?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">So that‚Äôs what his smile was for.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAfter what happened, I knew you wouldn‚Äôt want to come.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-281" class="calibre12">‚ÄúCon knew? How could con know that?‚Äù M·∫π res back. The red
                        in
                        her dress seems to take on a life of its own, a re in the night. Ba interrupts her, telling her
                        in
                        Vietnamese to lower her voice. He‚Äôs playing the opposite role today; his eyes beseech me,
                        reminding
                        me of when I cried and cried. He‚Äôs on my side, but he can‚Äôt do much if I don‚Äôt explain myself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">If I don‚Äôt finally tell the truth about myself.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúM·∫π, I don‚Äôt want to lie to you anymore. And I know I‚Äôve lied. About what I
                        wanted.
                        About my art. About B·∫£o, too, and our‚Ä¶ friendship. At the time, I thought all of this was
                        necessary.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My voice cracks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a painter. And I really love what I do. Nothing makes me
                        happier. When everything in the world seems tough and harsh, painting‚Äôs where I go. It‚Äôs like
                        you
                        and your cooking, M·∫π. Don‚Äôt you ever feel like you can disappear in it?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π folds her arms, and keeps her eyes xed to the ground.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI still wanted to make you proud and show that everything I was doing was <i
                            class="calibre5">because</i> of you, not despite you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere are other ways to make Ba M·∫π proud. Above everything, you should not lie
                        to
                        us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt mean it like that. M·∫π, please. I draw <i
                            class="calibre5">because</i>
                        of you. Because you‚Äôve always tried your best to raise me right. Because you work so hard, never
                        find time for yourself, so I‚Äôm doing this for you, for both of you. Everything</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">you‚Äôre doing has allowed me to be happy. I wish you had that when you were
                        younger.
                        You worked so hard, you gave everything of yourself away just so that I could have a good life.
                        And
                        I believe that. I have a good life. I have a happy one.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúPlease. I want to show you what I mean. Can I show you?‚Äù I hold her hand. The
                        fact
                        that she doesn‚Äôt pull away encourages me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I lead her back into the school like I did at Huntington Beach, that time we
                        saw my
                        rst real artist. It wasn‚Äôt just because I wanted to see; it was because I wanted my mom to see
                        it
                        too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Distantly, I hear Yamamoto greeting my parents. I don‚Äôt eavesdrop, but I stand
                        aside and observe their faces. A bit of confusion. A bit of disbelief. They must be overwhelmed
                        because it‚Äôs not just Yamamoto gravitating toward them; it‚Äôs other parents whose kids also
                        displayed
                        their work.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-282" class="calibre12">What surprises me more, though, is the quiet awe
                        burgeoning
                        in their eyes, a reaction they would have to my pieces from elementary school art classes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Taking my mom‚Äôs hand again, I point to a scene that I hadn‚Äôt shown B·∫£o yet,
                        hadn‚Äôt
                        gotten to. I painted it because I was remembering how much simpler life was a few months ago.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs a nine-by-eleven-inch piece depicting the hours following our rst special:
                        the
                        three of us celebrating in the kitchen. It might have been dark outside, but inside the kitchen,
                        under the bright ceiling lights, we were exhausted and hopeful. My mom bends closer to the
                        canvas. I
                        hope she sees the look in her eyes that I tried to capture, that tired contentedness. I hope she
                        sees me leaning against her, shoulder to shoulder. And I hope she sees my dad and how tall he
                        sits.
                        Most of all, I want her to see how the three of us are together, a family. We are strongest only
                        together.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI really love this one,‚Äù Yamamoto remarks, standing just behind me. I spot my
                        mom
                        squinting at the tattoos along her arms, more curious than horrified.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù my dad finally asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve come to know Linh over the years, Mr. Mai and Mrs. Ph·∫°m. I‚Äôve
                        seen
                        how much she cares about what you think. But I‚Äôve also seen how present and alive she is through
                        her
                        art&mdash;probably more than she realizes. And just a few minutes ago, watching you walk into
                        the
                        auditorium, I saw how Linh lights up knowing that you‚Äôre here to support her.‚Äù B·∫£o‚Äôs right; my
                        expressions give me away. ‚ÄúAll of this‚Äù&mdash;she gestures to the paintings&mdash;‚Äúthis is Linh
                        and
                        what she values the most. In one exhibition.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBeing an artist‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard,‚Äù M·∫π says slowly. I wonder if she‚Äôs cautious to
                        voice
                        this opinion in front of a teacher.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh, it is. You know it is. And from my brief conversation with your
                        sister‚Äù&mdash;Yamamoto tips her head at my aunt, who‚Äôs mingling with people at the opposite side
                        of
                        the room&mdash;‚Äúshe knows, too. But in anything you love, isn‚Äôt there always some bit of
                        sadness,
                        some essence of suffering? That, to me, is what makes art worth it. Su er through it&mdash;mine
                        the
                        emotions you keep inside yourself, face whatever‚Äôs emotionally burdensome, take control of
                        it&mdash;then emerge reborn in the end.‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-283" class="calibre12">She speaks directly to me. ‚ÄúThis is what Linh is doing.
                        It‚Äôs
                        such an honor to be her teacher. I hope you know that Linh‚Äôs one of a kind.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Yamamoto squeezes my arm, before drifting back into the crowd, like a kind
                        spirit.
                        Other classmates and their parents surround me and for the rst time tonight, I bask in their
                        warm
                        glow. I keep an eye on my parents simultaneously. They‚Äôre walking around, peering at other
                        artwork.
                        My aunt soon joins them and points at certain canvases and sculptures, perhaps explaining the
                        different media. Ali‚Äôs been going around the room interviewing other artists, explaining that
                        she
                        couldn‚Äôt show bias in her reporting. B·∫£o, though, seems to have disappeared, understanding that
                        I
                        needed more time with my parents.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The auditorium clears out and only ve or six families linger. My parents rejoin
                        me
                        along with my aunt, and all I can do is follow them as they wordlessly head back out into the
                        hallway. Our footsteps squeak and echo into the empty space. I‚Äôm sandwiched between my aunt and
                        my
                        mom. I‚Äôm struck by the need to clutch M·∫π‚Äôs hand again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">M·∫π‚Äôs voice startles me from my thoughts. ‚ÄúFrom now on, con can‚Äôt tell more
                        lies. <i class="calibre5">ƒê·ª´ng no·∫•i la·∫•o n·ªØa nghe kh√¥ng?</i>‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I nod, promising that there won‚Äôt be any more lies between us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúArt is what you want? It makes you happy?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba had asked the same question.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe happiest, M·∫π.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We walk some more, now standing in the parking lot. The faint smell of grass,
                        barbeque smoke, and asphalt surrounds us. ‚ÄúM·∫π <i class="calibre5">c√≤n</i> mad at you,‚Äù M·∫π
                        answers
                        calmly.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI know. But I promise, I won‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">In a split second, I‚Äôm crushed against my mother. Her arms leave no room for
                        escape. ‚ÄúYou know you are my life, con,‚Äù M·∫π whispers fiercely into my hair.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I blink away tears, my head buried in her shoulder. I feel Ba patting my back,
                        and
                        my mind ashes back to a younger me, a sleepy me, who‚Äôs carried up to bed by my parents.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-284" class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry,‚Äù D√¨ V√†ng says, happiness pure in her voice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm not sure which one of us she is talking to.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">In the car, as we‚Äôre pulling out of the lot, M·∫π reaches back with her hand. I
                        grasp,
                        asking whose hand it is.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat a silly game,‚Äù my aunt mutters with a smile. My mom and I grin at each
                        other
                        through the mirror.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My family spends the rest of the ride bashing other artists, even though I
                        think
                        they‚Äôre all great. Dad called them ‚Äú<i class="calibre5">d·ªü qu√°.</i>‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo how much better am I as an artist?‚Äù I tease Ba.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And his answer surprises me in the best way possible, as he sends me a big, fat
                        smile in the rearview mirror.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">M·ªôt trƒÉm</i> percent.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 47</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">T·∫øt in Little Saigon means tons of road closures. The few police officers who
                        didn‚Äôt
                        grow up around here look befuddled by our penchant for bouncy music, performances from dojos,
                        and
                        bedazzled oats filled with flowers&mdash;lots of them. The American flag and South Vietnamese
                        flag
                        hang along light poles.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The air is filled with the smell of fried sweets&mdash;bananas, I
                        think&mdash;and
                        the crowd ranges from young to old. Little kids run along, some struggling in their bright silky
                        <i class="calibre5">√°o d√†i</i>, followed by a parent looking stressed out and clutching their
                        child‚Äôs mini <i class="calibre5">khƒÉn ƒë√≥ng</i>. But the hate of hats is universal in kids their
                        age.
                        Old dads try locating their wives, who‚Äôve abandoned them for friends; today‚Äôs their day off. I
                        sputter when some stray balloons collide with my face. A sunshine-y version of ‚Äú<i
                            class="calibre5">Xu√¢n ƒë√£ v·ªÅ</i>,‚Äù celebrating the arrival of spring, blasts from a float
                        made
                        out of straw. Miss Teen Vietnam, California, sits perched at the front, waving prettily from it.
                        People holler from the crowd.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLook at how skinny she is,‚Äù Mom mutters, clutching her purse to herself. She
                        then
                        nastily eyes a pack of girls who inadvertently pushed her to take pictures of the passing float.
                        As
                        much as she hates crowds, she always makes a point of attending the celebrations. I think it
                        reminds
                        her of her childhood. And she always manages to run into some Vietnamese friends.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The cash prize is the other draw, ranging from five hundred to five grand. ‚ÄúHow
                        else will we pay for college?‚Äù Ba replied when I asked why we entered with little chance to win.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Scarily, there was no joke in his tone whatsoever.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The usual float from Vietnam America TV 57.3 passes. Another float comes by,
                        some
                        local florist shop, and they‚Äôre launching bouquets into the crowds. M·∫π smacks my dad on the
                        shoulder. ‚ÄúLook at the flowers!‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-286" class="calibre12">Lo and behold, she isn‚Äôt the only middle-aged Asian
                        oohing
                        and ahhing at the flowers being thrown to the crowd. With swiftness that surprises me, my mom
                        jumps
                        to grab a bunch, holding them over her head victoriously. Ba makes some joke, though I can tell
                        he‚Äôs
                        proud of her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Just then, I see the familiar swish of hair across the street, standing behind
                        the
                        fence. Linh. She leans over, peering for the next float to come by, and she‚Äôs smiling. That‚Äôs my
                        girlfriend across the street. A real girlfriend. <i class="calibre5">As opposed to‚Ä¶?</i> says a
                        voice strangely like Vi·ªát‚Äôs in my head.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Could she be more beautiful? This time, she‚Äôs tied her hair in a side braid and
                        is
                        clapping along to the music.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh is with her parents and another woman who must be her aunt. She has long
                        hair
                        just like Linh. She mentioned she was visiting. I push my way up to the front, earning some
                        elbow
                        jabs along the way, but I can‚Äôt help but feel as if something is pulling me toward her. I wave
                        my
                        arms wide, yell out her name.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She notices.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">What are you doing?</i> her panicked eyes seem to say.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">There‚Äôs nothing to be scared of anymore! Our parents know
                            we‚Äôre
                            seeing each other</i>, I say back with my eyes. When nothing changes in her expression, I
                        realize that we haven‚Äôt mastered telepathy just yet. Behind me, I hear my parents calling my
                        name,
                        confused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The crowd is so ferocious that it crushes me against the fence. Linh still
                        looks
                        scared. At this point, neither her parents or her aunt have noticed me‚Ä¶ but then she does. The
                        aunt,
                        at least. Her face goes slack, stopping me in my tracks. I‚Äôve never seen anyone turn white that
                        quickly, but why at me? But her eyes don‚Äôt lock on me; they slide right past me‚Ä¶ zooming in on
                        my
                        parents, who, I turn and realize, froze in the middle as well.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">It‚Äôs like the meeting at the Buddha temple again.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then something weird happens. Linh‚Äôs aunt turns‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">And runs.</p>

                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I never expected B·∫£o to be at my doorstep.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Or that he‚Äôd be able to come into the house at all. But that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening
                        now. He‚Äôs sitting next to me in the living room, as if we do this every week.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asks, tucking a hair strand behind my ear, which makes me panic.
                        My
                        eyes go to my dad, who‚Äôs sitting in his usual chair; he keeps shooting us inquisitive glances,
                        but
                        if he disapproves of our proximity, he doesn‚Äôt say much. My mother, who let B·∫£o inside in the
                        first
                        place, is more preoccupied with my aunt, who, upon returning from the parade, walked straight
                        into
                        the master bedroom, locking the door. Not answering anyone, even my mother as she pleads for her
                        to
                        come out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening? Are you okay?‚Äù she asks through the door.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The bedroom door creeps open and we all stand when my aunt appears, red-eyed
                        but
                        otherwise composed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSorry, I needed to collect myself.‚Äù Her eyes sweep the room before landing on
                        B·∫£o,
                        the only one who doesn‚Äôt belong. Seconds pass, the silence grows disconcerting. ‚ÄúI saw you at
                        the
                        fair, but to see you in the daylight like that‚Ä¶ you really do look like your uncle.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve been told.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow much do you know?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I speak for myself and B·∫£o, explaining how B√°c had told me about our families
                        knowing each other back in Vietnam. About the photo I found, which was when B·∫£o sheepishly
                        recounted
                        his story about what his mother said&mdash;not the accusation&mdash;but the distress that she
                        expressed when she found out we knew each other.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-288" class="calibre12">M·∫π sits silently, nervously, as Ba stands by the living
                        room
                        window, watching us.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My aunt turns back to M·∫π. ‚ÄúI already knew they were here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDoes it matter?‚Äù my aunt counters. ‚ÄúNow why didn‚Äôt you tell me all of this?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to hurt you again. I didn‚Äôt want to bring up memories that were
                        meant to be forgotten.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">D√¨ V√†ng shakes her head. ‚ÄúThat was a long time ago. I‚Äôm an adult now.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou were in love with him,‚Äù M·∫π says. ‚ÄúAnd he left you without a thought. That
                        was
                        his fault. And his family‚Äôs. And it was all unforgivable.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDo you know why he left?‚Äù my aunt asks sharply. ‚ÄúHe was to inherit the family
                        business.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a reason to celebrate, not abandon you. He should have been taking care
                        of
                        you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">D√¨ V√†ng sco s, throwing her hands up. ‚ÄúOf course! Because I was destined to be
                        poor
                        just because I‚Äôm an artist.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe all know the struggle. You couldn‚Äôt just ignore it. It was the reality.‚Äù My
                        mother looks to me now, only this isn‚Äôt about me. ‚ÄúOur parents were just doing their part and
                        looking out for you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm here. And I‚Äôm ne, you didn‚Äôt need to protect me. You don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying to yourself. I knew you were sad after he left. And I could
                        barely
                        speak to his family after that. How could I? When they were the ones who drove him away,
                        convinced
                        him of a better match.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not to blame at all,‚Äù D√¨ V√†ng says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow? How do you know?‚Äù M·∫π demands. My dad mutters something; I suspect it‚Äôs to
                        tell her to calm down, but he‚Äôs silenced with a withering glance.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause I was the one to tell him to leave.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The puzzle dislodges again, my understanding of this very weird situation
                        disappearing in a millisecond. My eyes move between my mom and D√¨ V√†ng, a staring contest in
                        play,
                        both willing the other to speak rst. Ba sits silently, arms crossed, his expression emotionless.
                    </p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-289" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù my mom whispers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat no one knows, no one but me and B·∫£o‚Äôs uncle, is that we were never
                        together.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">G√¨? N√≥i l·∫°i</i>,‚Äù my mother says, confused.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe were a distraction. He liked Huy·ªÅn.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHuy·ªÅn?‚Äù M·∫π looked away, a hardened version sco ng at the name. Now I wonder
                        what
                        that woman did to get on my mother‚Äôs bad side.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, Huy·ªÅn.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWho was she?‚Äù I ask.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúNeighborhood girl,‚Äù D√¨ V√†ng explains quickly. ‚ÄúBut her family was poorer than
                        both
                        of ours and Cam‚Äôs family would have never approved of the match.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù my mom mutters dismissively. ‚ÄúBecause they were prejudiced.‚Äù B·∫£o
                        stiffens
                        beside me. First time over and he‚Äôs indirectly insulted by my mother.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI could say the same about ours,‚Äù my aunt retorts, her tone severe enough to
                        rival
                        my mom‚Äôs. ‚ÄúFinancial security, wasn‚Äôt it? Ultimately that‚Äôs why our parents approved of us so
                        much.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut Cam was my best friend. And he loved my other friend, so I pretended that
                        I
                        was seeing him whenever we left the neighborhood, but I was really bringing him to see Huy·ªÅn.‚Äù
                        Once
                        the last words leave her, her secret finally released, she sits down. She touches her necklace
                        in
                        thought. ‚ÄúThen the whole engagement happened and we were swept up with family expectations,
                        trying
                        to make things work out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúRemember, Huy·ªÅn had to leave because her parents ed rst. And then he was so
                        sad. I
                        couldn‚Äôt get a word out of him. I couldn‚Äôt make him happy, even as his best friend. So I told
                        him to
                        go after her. Life was already miserable back home because of Viet Cong, you know that. Having a
                        broken heart as well?‚Äù My aunt shakes her head. ‚ÄúSo I told him to go. Find her wherever she is
                        and
                        tell her the truth. Start a new life together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She exhales shakily. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think he would lose his life along the way.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I look over at B·∫£o, his mouth slightly opened at the revelations emerging in
                        our
                        living room. He‚Äôd been in the dark just like I was, and now things are just beginning to make
                        sense.
                        These decades of blame from our families manifesting in what we thought was just a silly
                        competition.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-290" class="calibre12">‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be true,‚Äù M·∫π says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say anything?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow would I even <i class="calibre5">begin</i> to explain myself? It was, to
                        everyone, a perfect match. M·∫π and Ba‚Äù&mdash;hearing my aunt mention her parents makes her sound
                        young again&mdash;‚Äúit was something they were happy about too.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut Cam‚Äôs family&mdash;they blame you. Don‚Äôt you remember how angry you were
                        at
                        each other? The yelling that happened. His sister said horrible things.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúShe‚Äôd lost her brother.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúStill! They shouldn‚Äôt have said you were heartless. Worthless.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Is that when things went sour?</i> I remember my mom‚Äôs
                        reaction
                        when she saw the picture of me and B·∫£o. Her anger overpowered me, overpowered any logic. I can
                        only
                        imagine the ugly words that ew between our families.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúMy family doesn‚Äôt know the truth, do they?‚Äù B·∫£o asks. M·∫π‚Äôs eyes y to him,
                        widening
                        before narrowing, as if she‚Äôs just realized who she actually let in. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they‚Äôre still
                        angry
                        at your family.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThe things that were said were hurtful. But they didn‚Äôt hurt me. <i
                            class="calibre5">They</i> were hurt. They‚Äôd just lost a son. A brother.‚Äù She turns to my
                        parents. ‚ÄúIf you lost me, wouldn‚Äôt you react the same way, look for someone to blame?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only so much anger you can hold. But I‚Äôm hopeful, because here are
                        Linh
                        and B·∫£o, willing to move past this.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB·∫£o‚Äôs great,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúAnd his family cares about him just as much as you care
                        about me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He squeezes my hand, a smile playing on his lips. This time I don‚Äôt blush; I‚Äôm
                        bolstered by his silent agreement. ‚ÄúWhen a bunch of racists hounded our place and nearly
                        everywhere
                        else in Bolsa, he wrote an article, for all of us. Because it‚Äôs right.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My aunt appraises him and, based on her smile, seems to think more of him. ‚ÄúHe
                        wrote what he thought was best. He didn‚Äôt let a little history get in the way of what‚Äôs right.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o shifts in his seat. ‚ÄúWhat if you spoke to my family?‚Äù</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-291" class="calibre12">My mom sits up straight. ‚ÄúWhat? No, no, no, it‚Äôs too
                        much. I
                        don‚Äôt want to see them. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ too much has happened.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAll because I held back the truth for years. And now look at what happened. I
                        have
                        to take the blame for that. We‚Äôre going,‚Äù my aunt says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My aunt turns to me, then brings her gaze up to B·∫£o. ‚ÄúCall your parents.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Even though he suggested it, his Adam‚Äôs apple nervously bobs as he nods.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 49</h3>
                    <h2>Bao</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">My mom paces the restaurant, nervously smoothing out her dress, the same one she
                        wore for our on-camera interview. She‚Äôs pretending to mutter to herself&mdash; meaning, very out
                        loud at me and Ba&mdash;about how Linh‚Äôs family has the nerve to come over uninvited, like
                        uncultured swine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Never mind the fact that Linh‚Äôs family called to explain their visit.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Or that I told them Linh‚Äôs aunt would be here too.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Or that the time was one that my mom decided.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Not knowing what to do with myself, I join my father in the kitchen, where he
                        uses
                        a ladle to pour <i class="calibre5">chanh mu·ªëi&mdash;</i>salty limeade&mdash;from a large jar
                        into
                        six drinking glasses. Limes are packed tightly for months, then finished off with a bit of
                        sugar,
                        water, and ice. I nd myself salivating; I haven‚Äôt had it since I was little.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba looks up briefly, finishing the last glass. ‚ÄúThey made the best lemon tea.
                        Linh‚Äôs grandmother. After school, we would all go to her grandmother‚Äôs house for a glass. It was
                        refreshing.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I say, unsure how to respond to the comment, a memory about the other
                        family,
                        whom they‚Äôd hated for so long, shared so willingly. I‚Äôm saved from answering as he gestures for
                        me
                        to bring the glasses out and place them on the table.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">The light falls on our family‚Äôs black-and-white photos, which have watched over
                        me
                        as long as memory serves me. The sight of them sends me some hope. Whatever happens today, they
                        will
                        be our witnesses.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">As I wait at the front desk, tuning out my mother‚Äôs dark thoughts, eager for a
                        glimpse of movement outside the windows, I can‚Äôt help but feel a strange sort of calm, too. An
                        inevitability that started the moment my mother let Linh into the restaurant, despite her family
                        and
                        who she is.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-293" class="calibre12">I hold on to the feeling when I see Linh leading her
                        family
                        over.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúSo what!‚Äù my mom calls out, but she leaves the kitchen, starts fretting with
                        the
                        dishware and silverware.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHow are things over here?‚Äù Linh murmurs once inside. We stay back as our
                        families
                        le into the dining room.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúFrickin‚Äô weird.‚Äù I don‚Äôt take my eyes o our families, together in one place.
                        It‚Äôs
                        like I‚Äôm watching my favorite television show live for the rst time: familiar players but
                        unknown
                        outcomes. ‚ÄúI checked my mom for weapons and she‚Äôs clean.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh sti es a laugh, then squeezes my hand before letting go too early. I run
                        my
                        hand down her back in a fleeting gesture of comfort&mdash;for the both of us&mdash; before
                        focusing
                        on our respective parents in the dining area. My mom saw this interaction, brief shock sparking
                        in
                        her eyes, but says nothing.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She stands stiffly next to Ba</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while,‚Äù Linh‚Äôs mother says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt has.‚Äù My mom nods at Linh‚Äôs aunt. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were visiting.‚Äù Her
                        familiar brisk tone has given way to a different sound. I realize then that her voice is
                        wavering.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">At Ba‚Äôs gesture, we all sit at once: three on each side of the booth, with
                        Linh‚Äôs
                        aunt pulling up a chair at the head. I can‚Äôt remember how to move my hands, where to put them.
                        Linh
                        throws me a hesitant smile across the table. Her ankle brushes up against mine.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you staying in America for long?‚Äù M·∫π asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes, only a few weeks. I‚Äôve been planning on visiting for a while. So far
                        things
                        have been exciting.‚Äù Linh‚Äôs aunt keeps her tone light and airy; she‚Äôs treating this like a
                        regular
                        occurrence.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd what do you do now over in Vietnam?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm still an artist. I sculpt. I make jewelry and vases.‚Äù She reaches into her
                        bag
                        and places down a figurine&mdash;a red dragon with yellow spots along its body. My mom doesn‚Äôt
                        touch
                        it. Ba‚Äôs the one to take it in hand.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-294" class="calibre12">He nods solemnly. ‚ÄúA beautiful dragon.‚Äù Still he pushes
                        it an
                        inch back to Linh‚Äôs aunt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know why it‚Äôs a dragon?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Here I‚Äôm lost and fascinated at once&mdash;nameless emotions cloud, then
                        disappear
                        from my mom‚Äôs face.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">D√¨ V√†ng‚Äôs smile is wry. ‚ÄúYear of the Dragon. Cam‚Äôs year.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom glances down once at the dragon before clearing her throat. ‚ÄúWhy is it
                        that
                        you‚Äôre here?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI was surprised to see you at the parade. Linh had mentioned you, but seeing
                        you
                        so abruptly, I ran. I remembered our last encounter. I remembered what we said. And now I think
                        it‚Äôs
                        time we put this all to bed.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat is there to say?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh‚Äôs aunt inhales. ‚ÄúI know you blame me and my family for your brother‚Äôs
                        death.
                        That you think I somehow hurt him and made him leave the country, and that‚Äôs how he died. And
                        what I
                        want to say is that I am guilty. But not in the way you think.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom leans forward, the chair creaking.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBefore he left, Cam wasn‚Äôt in love with me. He was in love with someone else.‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you saying he was unfaithful?‚Äù My mom starts rising from her seat, ready
                        to
                        defend her brother‚Äôs honor, yet Linh‚Äôs aunt remains seated, shoulders squared&mdash;just like
                        Linh
                        when she has her mind set. Even though we‚Äôve barely spoken to each other, I‚Äôm beginning to like
                        her.
                        This is someone who, long ago, knew how to stand her ground against my mom, a force of nature
                        even
                        though she was younger.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you the truth. My truth. And his.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not his truth, since he is not here.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe was in love with Huy·ªÅn. Remember her? The granddaughter of the woman who
                        always
                        sold sh to the neighborhood on Saturday mornings? The freshest kind! Didn‚Äôt we all used to
                        admire
                        how neatly she was able to braid her hair?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom‚Äôs brow is creased. ‚ÄúShe told us her grandfather would braid it. Because
                        her
                        grandmother‚Äôs hands always smelled of sh.‚Äù She sounds far away, her mind‚Äôs eye sifting through
                        memories.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-295" class="calibre12">‚ÄúYes! Huy·ªÅn. She was a lovely girl. So smart. So
                        beautiful.‚Äù
                        Linh‚Äôs aunt pauses. ‚ÄúThe only strike against her was that she was poor and her parents had
                        abandoned
                        her.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúCam and I were close, so I knew of his feelings. I always knew. The whole
                        time, I
                        was the one orchestrating their visits, giving them time to spend with each other while you all
                        thought we were together.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù my mom breathes.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBecause I did love him. And because I knew he was happy with her.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúBut the engagement&mdash;why‚Ä¶ how?‚Äù Ba asks.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLike I told my sister, we were just swept away by it. We couldn‚Äôt get out of
                        it. I
                        saw that Cam was miserable. But everyone was so stuck in their ways. And so Cam resigned himself
                        to
                        it.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúIf he was so resigned&mdash;you would have been married,‚Äù my mom says harshly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúI told him to go. You know how vocal he was? How miserable he would have been
                        in
                        that country? Even if she hadn‚Äôt gone, he would have eventually left.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd he died.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never forget. But then I think of it: Who controls
                        the
                        storm? How can anyone divine the seas?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know that I feel the same way? That if I could <i
                            class="calibre5">make</i> him love me that would be enough? But that‚Äôs impossible. You can‚Äôt
                        control who you love, any more than anyone can control the seas that took him from you. From
                        me.‚Äù
                        Her voice cracks. ‚ÄúFrom all of us.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Linh looks at me.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hold Linh‚Äôs gaze.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Kh√¥ng bao gi·ªù em kh√¥ng nh·ªõ</i> Cam.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">There‚Äôs not a day that goes by that I don‚Äôt remember
                            him.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A pause so long that we can hear the kitchen fan rumble and the clock in the
                        back
                        of the room tick away. The air returns, allowing us to move. In this moment, we‚Äôre all standing
                        on a
                        precipice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I hold my breath as Linh‚Äôs aunt reaches over, clasping my mom‚Äôs hand. She
                        doesn‚Äôt
                        pull away. ‚ÄúCam is gone.‚Äù But she gestures to everyone. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt you think he would be even
                        more
                        upset to see how our families turned out in the end? We were once so close.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-296" class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe were like family. We su ered together. We celebrated
                        together. To hear what has happened all these years in between&mdash;which I only found out
                        because
                        Linh told me&mdash;it‚Äôs just wrong. This‚Ä¶ rivalry.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom raises her chin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs natural for restaurants to compete against each
                        other.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOurs was not natural,‚Äù Linh‚Äôs mom interjects.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWhat did you expect? Your mother was always the better chef and she was the
                        one to
                        teach you how to cook. Of course I felt intimidated when you arrived on the scene.‚Äù Never in a
                        million years did I think my mom would admit her recipe was inferior.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know you were across from us when we agreed to buy the restaurant
                        from
                        B√°c Xu√¢n. We never meant to compete; it was a way to provide for our daughters.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúWho turned out brilliantly,‚Äù Linh‚Äôs aunt adds, throwing a proud look at Linh,
                        who
                        tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. I‚Äôm brie y distracted by the blush on her cheeks. ‚ÄúAnd it
                        seems like your son has grown up admirably because of your hard work, too.‚Äù I scratch the back
                        of my
                        head as Linh playfully kicks me under the table. ‚ÄúWe can all agree on that.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">She softens her tone. ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt always competing with each other tiring? At
                        what
                        point will you have won? Either of you?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôm not sure if my parents have ever asked themselves that question. But I know
                        the
                        answer. There is no point to it. There‚Äôs no winning if all this competition has been masking a
                        war
                        on matters unrelated to the number of customers that come in, the number of bowls sold each day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">By the way my mom sags into her seat, she‚Äôs probably just reached the same
                        conclusion. Her eyes skirt over to our wall. She might be looking at her brother, having a
                        silent
                        conversation with him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúB√°c Xu√¢n‚Ä¶ By selling the restaurant to you, I sense he was trying to get us to
                        forgive each other.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúVery unsuccessful,‚Äù Linh‚Äôs mom says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúHe was always nosy.‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">Our dads arrive at an agreement first and now it‚Äôs up to our mothers.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Our parents glance down at the plates, pushing around their food, running out
                        of
                        words.</p>

                    <p class="calibre12">I gulp. This is it. Everything will be derailed.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Then, unbelievably, a full-blown smile appears on her face. ‚ÄúSome things really
                        don‚Äôt change.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Instead, my mom sni s in a way that tells me she‚Äôs not really mad. ‚ÄúBlame your

                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">Our families have a lot of catching up to do. Their reminiscences continue,
                        pushing
                        me and Linh out of the conversation. But it‚Äôs ne, because at least everything is out there,
                        finally
                        out there. Sharing one look, we rise from the table, and me and Linh head outside. We nd a spot
                        by
                        the curb and sit down&mdash; right across from the very spot where we shared our very rst laugh.

                    <p class="calibre12">Linh rests her head on my shoulder. ‚ÄúIs this a dream?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I laugh before dropping a kiss on her crown. ‚ÄúIf it is, let‚Äôs stay inside it

                    <h3>Chapter 50</h3>
                    <h2>Linh</h2>
                    <p>
                    <p class="calibre1">The Mais and the Nguy·ªÖns will never be the best of friends they once were
                        decades
                        ago. Too much history clouds the waters we share. But at least there are fewer words left
                        unsaid. In
                        a spirit of forgiveness, the Lunar New Year passed with ease.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">My mom and B·∫£o‚Äôs mom have taken to sharing their homestyle recipes, updating
                        each
                        other with each culinary treat they make at home. Sometimes they visit each other at their
                        respective restaurants. My dad and his dad mesh well; if anyone looks closer, it would seem that
                        they were brothers. My aunt now calls B·∫£o‚Äôs mom&mdash;whether she wants to hear from her or not.
                        B·∫£o‚Äôs still trying to figure that out.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I know things will be all right. Because each visit, each moment spent
                        together,
                        each laugh shared repairs what‚Äôs been broken, like a brush of gesso gently rejuvenating
                        something
                        precious from long ago.</p>
                    <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="calibre1">I don‚Äôt think Chef L√™ understood what he was getting into when he invited me and
                        B·∫£o
                        <i class="calibre5">and</i> our families to his restaurant. He apologized profusely, saying he
                        meant
                        to do it right after my mural was unveiled, but his son, Philippe, had gotten sick and there
                        wasn‚Äôt
                        enough time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Faced with two strong women with strong opinions on cooking, I almost expect
                        Chef
                        L√™ to melt under their interrogation. But of course, he had his own Vietnamese mother to contend
                        with growing up, and he easily deflects the heat. I would even say they are impressed by the
                        kitchen
                        work ow and some of his dishes&mdash;maybe even curious to get their hands on his recipes.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-300" class="calibre12">In the dining room, I glance across the table, watching
                        B·∫£o
                        try to fend o his mother‚Äôs insistence that he needs to eat more rice. My own mother warns me to
                        watch for bones from one of the plates of <i class="calibre5">c√° chi√™n</i> sitting at the center
                        of
                        the table, even though I‚Äôve eaten this kind of sh my entire life. Meanwhile, our respective
                        fathers
                        sit across from each other in companionable silence, preoccupied by their own bowls of rice.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">B·∫£o‚Äôs hair is still slightly wet. Seeing Chef L√™ and Sa ron‚Äôs son across from
                        him,
                        he tries to make the poor kid laugh, but Philippe is completely unamused. Once in a while, from
                        his
                        position on his father‚Äôs lap, he glances confusedly for help from his mother. He only smiles
                        when
                        Saffron mutters an endearment in French, then crawls into her arms.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ali had jokingly said that this was the dinner of the century, and I‚Äôm sure if
                        I
                        told her where I was going, she‚Äôd probably follow. Lately, she‚Äôs had this ridiculous idea that
                        she‚Äôll write a novel about two warring Vietnamese families whose respective son and daughter
                        fall in
                        love. I don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôll do it, but I guess Ali can do anything once she puts her mind to
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Under the table, I feel B·∫£o squeeze my hand. We don‚Äôt quite hide it from our
                        families&mdash;us dating, even though ‚Äúno dating until you‚Äôre married‚Äù is a common refrain from
                        our
                        parents. And when I do leave the house or take a break to visit B·∫£o at his restaurant, my dad‚Äôs
                        always saying, ‚ÄúAh, her <i class="calibre5">b·∫°n</i>.‚Äù Her ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">We‚Äôll get there‚Ä¶ like everything else.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Our dinner finally ends and the laughter in our throats&mdash;courtesy of Chef
                        L√™‚Äôs
                        comedic timing&mdash; finally settles. Toothpicks are distributed and there is momentary silence
                        as
                        each adult digs into their teeth.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A server sidles up to the table, setting down the bill.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">A quiet ‚ÄúOh shit‚Äù slips out from Chef L√™‚Äôs lips as he remembers <i
                            class="calibre5">exactly</i> who‚Äôs at the table and the accompanying struggle of Vietnamese
                        families fighting over the bill. He mutters about checking on the kitchen and scurries away. Sa
                        ron
                        and Philippe soon join him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLet me get this,‚Äù my mom says first, using the tone that commands the line
                        cooks
                        and servers.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-301" class="calibre12">A glint appears in B·∫£o‚Äôs mom‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúOh no, let me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚Äú<i class="calibre5">Th√¥i, ƒë∆∞·ª£c r·ªìi</i>. Please, let me.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Who will win?</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I jump when B·∫£o whispers in my left ear, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of here? Before they
                        really
                        kill each other?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I nod and leave the table. So focused on the bill, our parents don‚Äôt notice our
                        departure.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Outside, we find ourselves in an alley, a familiar meeting spot for us, I
                        suppose.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúLast time we were in an alley, you almost turned me away,‚Äù B·∫£o says.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù I arch an eyebrow.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúAre you going to turn me away again?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Grinning mischievously, I press him against the wall and plant a loud smack on
                        his
                        lips. We burst out laughing the moment we part. ‚ÄúSmooth.‚Äù The grin stays on his face. ‚ÄúLinh?‚Äù
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I sigh, content. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">‚ÄúYou have paint in your hair again.‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I really did try to stay clean. I shrug. ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù I say, challenging him.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">He gives no response, a glint appearing in his eyes, and he reaches for me,
                        pulling
                        me to him by the loops of my jeans. His thumb caresses my cheek, and his eyes are soft.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Now we kiss for real.</p>

                    <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
                    <p class="calibre1">I have so many people to thank. Ba, I am thankful for your quiet love, comfort,
                        and encouragement. I will always remember your patience as I scoured the bookshelves at the
                        Cheshire Public Library&mdash;and later earned too many nes. M·∫π, you are the strongest person I
                        know and I would be lost without you. I‚Äôve grown to understand your strength and sacrifices more
                        and more. I think my love of storytelling started with you&mdash;those nights when you‚Äôd tell
                        stories about your childhood, squished between me and Ch·ªã An after we‚Äôd pushed our beds
                        together.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Ba, M·∫π, I love you, I love you, I love you. I can‚Äôt imagine not being your
                        daughter. I don‚Äôt think either of you ever tried stopping me from reading and writing, and I am
                        glad for that.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">An, our lives take us on different trajectories&mdash;<i
                            class="calibre5">very</i> different, lol. Your brilliance, your strength, and your love have
                        gotten me through so many things. You are truly my big sister. I love you, and I want the best
                        for you. I‚Äôm glad to be your sister-in-law, Kevin, and I can‚Äôt think of a better life partner
                        for An! I am also proud to be Calhoun‚Äôs aunt.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">Dan, you are a rare human in every way possible and I do love you.</p>
                    <p class="calibre12">I‚Äôd like to thank my extended family as well because when I was really young,
                        we lived or were always together. Now we‚Äôre scattered across America and Vietnam. I don‚Äôt take
                        their struggles, unseen and unsaid, lightly: D√¨ Ch√≠n, Anh B√©, Ch·ªã Ty, Ch·ªã Qu·ª≥nh, Anh S∆°n, Ch·ªã

                        only seen each other a handful of times, I want to send love to the West Coast fam (it‚Äôs
                        definitely been more than seven years), and to my family in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p id="calibre_link-303" class="calibre12">Jen Ung, this book literally wouldn‚Äôt have existed
                        without you. I admire you as an editor and I admire you for being my editor. Thank you for
                        bearing with my lateness, for your insightful notes, for your enthusiasm. I have learned so much

                        thankful for the support you‚Äôve shown me from the very beginning. You‚Äôre the best in the

                    <p class="calibre12">I don‚Äôt think I have enough space to thank everyone in my life, and I‚Äôm
                        actually afraid of forgetting people. Please don‚Äôt be offended if you‚Äôre not here. Some may know
                        their impact and some may not (surprise!), but I wanted to thank you regardless because you‚Äôve
                        enriched my life as a person, as a writer, and as an editor: Ali Famigletti&mdash;not the Ali in
                        this book&mdash;I‚Äôm glad to have found a soul sister in you. From the moment we bonded over <i

                        different from each other, and we‚Äôve done a lot of growing up. I love you. Love and hugs to the

                        Yamamoto, you left the world as I was writing this manuscript. I was imagining the day I visited
                        CHS and dropped o a copy in your office&mdash;the same office where our class, even after we
                        were done, shared more Occasional Papers and proudly hung up our college acceptances. I just
                        want to thank you for inspiring me, for being so kind to many, many, many people.</p>
