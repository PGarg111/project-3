                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">Hoisin sauce is not paint.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We need a sign that says that, because our customers don’t get it. Today’s
                    latest work is a misshapen star on the wall. A ve out of ten, if you ask me. The kid’s parent
                    probably did a double take, snatched the bottle away, then paid the check and left before Mẹ
                    could notice. To be honest, it’s not like the sauce makes our wall look worse; it’s just hard to
                    wipe o when it dries. But I try, I really do &mdash;sometimes. Maybe.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Various relatives from both sides of my family judge me from their
                    water-stained portraits that hang around the restaurant.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I sit down and look ahead at the ve booths I still need to wipe clean, but this
                    heat’s unbearable and the main fan, the good fan, died last week. Break time. I brush o grains
                    of rice that cling to my apron. Later, I’m sure I’ll nd a few that somehow end up under my socks
                    at the end of each shift. On the opposite side, my best friend, Việt, goes at the same pace as
                    me. His ears are plugged up, probably to block out the <i class="calibre5">Paris by
                        Night</i>&ndash;like soundtrack blasting from the back room, songs on repeat about the
                    Vietnam War, love, war, poverty, war.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt is the most chaotic neutral person I know. On any other day he wastes time
                    by raving about the latest criminal-investigation show he’s gotten hooked on. I consider that a
                    trade-o ; he’s the one who su ers through my fascination with strange words. Once I was wiping
                    down a front window from the inside, unknowingly overriding his work and adding more streaks
                    than there were to begin with. I’d been mentioning the word “defenestrate,” which made him
                    calmly threaten me with that very word.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre12">Ba stands behind the counter, punching in numbers at the
                    cash register, then piercing receipts onto a spindle. I think he nds the routine satisfying.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The front door opens, the bell shattering the slowness in the restaurant,
                    ushering in more sticky hot air. My mom’s voice whips two other lingering, taskless waiters to
                    attention, and I snatch up the towel and wipe o bean sprouts, lea ess stems of herbs, and straw
                    wrappers shaped as tiny accordions. Mẹ charges across the room. She drops her plastic shopping
                    bags in the path toward the kitchen, a storm on her face. Everyone clears the way for her; they
                    know Mẹ’s mood. But Ba’s expression is as indifferent as his look in their wedding pictures from
                    the 2000s: Stone. Cold.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom slaps down a crumpled piece of paper before him. “Anh, do you know what
                    they’re doing across the street?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Without looking up, speaking to his calculator, he asks, “Did you get more
                    sriracha sauce?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“On my way back, I saw these ugly posters all over the place.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“There was a sale. Did you get them on sale?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It’s always like this, their conversation misaligned, a <i class="calibre5">not
                        much</i> to a <i class="calibre5">how are you</i> question.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Lampposts, windows all over Bolsa Avenue!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Glass shatters in the back kitchen. The line cooks start blaming each other,
                    Spanish and Vietnamese mingling together. My guess: Bình did it. That guy sucks at his job more than
                    me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ ignores the noise. “Two-for-one. Two-for-one bowl of phở. <i
                        class="calibre5">Trời ơi</i>.” Only one family can get her riled up like this. She pauses.
                    “They’re trying to steal all our customers. Why isn’t Anh worried?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba snorts. “Their phở is not good. They never have enough salt.” Now <i
                        class="calibre5">that</i> I can’t verify. I’ve never stepped foot into the Mais’ restaurant.
                    Because what happens? Apparently my mom will cut my legs o .</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Maybe they had one of the waiters pose as a customer.…</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ nods, dialing back her worry. After a moment, she says, “Two-for-one phở. Who
                    wants to have phở <i class="calibre5">lạt</i>?” She laughs at her own joke about their phở’s
                    blandness. Ba joins, too.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre12">Lately their preoccupation with the Mais has ratcheted,
                    probably because they keep hearing about the changes the other family’s been making, changes that
                    seem to be in direct response to our adjustments. We’d recently added new wood grain blinds that
                    block out the sun&mdash;just because it looks like they replaced their blinds, too.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom zeroes in on me. <i class="calibre5">“Con đang làm gì đó?”</i> She side-eyes
                    my tables. “Why are the tables still dirty?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m not finished yet.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why not? He’s done.” Mẹ points to the opposite side.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I look across the room at Việt&mdash;</p>
                <p class="calibre12">And blink. The tables are shining, and the mirrors are ngerprint-less and&mdash;
                    yes&mdash;hoisin-less. Kid’s like an Asian Flash. “Oh, c’mon,” I mutter.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Giỏi quá!</i>” she says to the traitor.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Cảm ơn</i>,” Việt answers without a trace of an accent even
                    though he was born here.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom turns back to me. “Hurry up!” She jabs a finger at me. “And x your hair! It’s
                    so messy.” I can’t help it; my hair has a mind of its own.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The poster that Mẹ showed my dad oats to the ground in her wake. Curious, I pick it
                    up, passing by Việt. Making sure my mom’s a good distance away, I elbow him. “Suck-up.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt lands a punch to my stomach. “Lazy.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I pretend not to die; he’s always been stronger than me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt goes into the back room. I look down at the yer. I’m not sure how anything
                    like this can be considered ugly. It’s awesome. There’s no other word for it. Just really
                    cool&mdash;some kind of collage of old and modern Vietnam: a woman wearing a traditional silk white
                    dress and rice hat winking at a camera. You can see the sun and beachline&mdash;reminding me of Nha
                    Trang, my parents’ hometown&mdash;blazing behind her. An airplane ying above the woman spells out in
                    the clouds <span class="calibre13">OH MAI MAI PHỞ: TWO-FOR-ONE DEAL</span>. With this kind of
                    advertising from the Mai family, my parents should be worrying about <i class="calibre5">our</i>
                    advertising. We don’t have a Linh on our team.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I glance out the window. As if this poster summons her, Linh appears from Larkin
                    Street’s direction. She rushes into the restaurant, her flyaway hair alive, her large canvas bag,
                    which she hauls everywhere, hitting her long legs. Over the entrance and below a pagoda-style eave
                    hangs a South Việt ag just like ours&mdash; yellow with three red stripes&mdash;and it utters in
                    greeting to Linh. She’s always a colorful blur&mdash;going to class, dashing down La Quinta’s
                    hallways when the bell lets out, running into the restaurant at 3:30 p.m.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre12">I see her, but I know close to nothing about her. Maybe it’s a
                    good thing she’s constantly moving, because if she ever stopped, we might have to talk to each
                    other. And we haven’t done that since we were kids.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">Hypothetically, a Buddhist temple is not a place for insults or threats or a
                    potential bloodbath.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’ve gone to temple sporadically throughout my life, but the day I met Linh is the
                    most memorable, for many reasons, aside from running into the rest of the Mais and being <i
                        class="calibre5">thiiis</i> close to seeing bloodshed before Ông Phật.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Before meeting Linh, I’d never seen another seven-year-old kid stab paper with a
                    crayon. Repeatedly. We were in the kids’ room where the <i class="calibre5">chùa</i>’s volunteers
                    babysat kids as the parents went to worship or at least get a moment of silence. Mine were catching
                    up with friends upstairs. There were tables with</p>
                <p class="calibre4">finger paint, macaroni, glue, and paper, and another table with crayons and</p>
                <p class="calibre1">markers. I’m not sure why&mdash;maybe because it was less work&mdash;I went for the
                    crayons.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The other kids sat so far away from Linh because they were afraid she might turn on
                    them. But the look on her face was calm and concentrated&mdash;satisfied, even&mdash;and when she
                    made sure all of the crayons were completely dull, she raised her white paper in triumph. I was
                    closest to her, so she showed it to me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The dots formed a complete picture: green grass, a yellow sun, and a red-and-blue
                    swing set.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Wow,” I said, like any six-to-eight-year-old Asian kid with a bowl cut would say.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s the playground at my school,” she answered proudly.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre12">“Can you draw Spider-Man?” Because back then, that was the only
                    thing that mattered to me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Maybe. I can’t remember what he looks like. I need something to look at.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I have one! I can get it!” I’d brought along my Spider-Man backpack, but it was
                    upstairs in a cubby with our shoes. We raced out of the room, escaping the volunteers, who didn’t
                    really try to catch us. Up on the main oor, the temple membership was serving bowls of phở <i
                        class="calibre5">chay</i> and a white-haired lady waved us over for a bowl of vegetarian soup.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh took her bowl with everything that my family always taught me to use: hoisin
                    sauce, thai basil, and bean sprouts. That told me she knew phở; she <i class="calibre5">came</i>
                    from phở. It was confirmed when we both tried the phở at the same time and said, “BLECH.” Salty as
                    hell. We left our bowls, quick, then moved on to our destination.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Running, that’s what I remember. I was chasing a girl I barely knew, but I really
                    wanted that Spider-Man drawing. Before we could get to my backpack, though, Mẹ’s sharp voice rang
                    out. The one that still summons centuries’ worth of furious Vietnamese mothers. I froze. Our
                    families stood on opposite sides of the room, where Buddha was at the center, accepting gifts and
                    praise from the visitors. Linh and I were caught in between. I waited for Buddha to come alive,
                    chime in, like a referee, and bellow&mdash;while the ground vibrates forcibly &mdash;“Ready, set,
                    FIGHTTT!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But nothing like that happened.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh’s mom took one step forward, like she was marking her territory. Her eldest
                    daughter and husband were just behind her.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Đến đây</i>,” my mom said to me. I thought she was angry at me
                    for running in a temple. I couldn’t say no and when I was with her again, she gripped my hand tight.
                    Ba hung back, and I remember being confused by the fury barely contained on his face, so different
                    from his usual passivity.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">After that, they all but dragged me and Linh away from each other.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">“You still haven’t finished your tables.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre12">Ba’s voice from the front desk snaps me out of my memories.
                    I’m still standing by the windows, but I notice the sky is a bit darker and the lampposts are
                    starting to turn on. The din of inside chatter lls my ears.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why do you have that yer?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sorry,” I say. “I was thinking of how ugly it looked. Mẹ’s right.” I walk to the
                    nearest trash can, hand poised over it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The story of me and Linh at the temple could have been kept as a carefree memory,
                    lost and dusty like an old book in the basement. And I did actually forget about it; she was just
                    one of many kids I’d run around with and never saw again&mdash;best friends for an hour or two,
                    instead of forever.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Then Linh’s family opened their restaurant across from us ve years ago, and I knew
                    it was her. I knew she still drew, because she carried her portfolio with her everywhere, the size
                    of it almost as big as her body.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I also knew that I couldn’t go anywhere near her without risking my mom’s wrath.
                    Disdain was clear in my mom’s voice whenever she talked about <i class="calibre5">that</i>
                    restaurant, as if it were a person.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">I heard that restaurant underpays its staff.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">That restaurant is connected to a gang; they just moved from
                        San Jose, after all.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">That restaurant blackmailed Bác Xuân, pushed him out of his
                        business.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">That last reason might be why the neighbors didn’t accept them so easily at</p>
                <p class="calibre4">rst. Bác Xuân had basically helped the area flourish, connecting fellow business</p>
                <p class="calibre1">owners with the right people. Beloved, you can say. I don’t think my mom’s circle of
                    friends made it any easier for <i class="calibre5">that restaurant&mdash;</i>social wolves who ran
                    various businesses in the area: like Lien Hoa BBQ Deli, nail and hair salons, and even one travel
                    agency. Back then advertising wasn’t really a thing, so the good word of one of these women? Certified. You either get a <i class="calibre5">dở ẹc</i> or a <i class="calibre5">cũng được</i>, the
                    latter being as close to great as you can get in terms of Vietnamese praise. Their group is led by
                    Nhi Trưng, an older woman who constantly liked to brag that her name bears a similarity to one of
                    the female military leaders to rebel against the Chinese domination centuries ago&mdash;as I
                    discovered on Wikipedia. As if that was supposed to impress people these days. I think of her as the
                    General, though the real-life Nhi Trưng was the general’s daughter.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre12">She had a special reason for hating the Mais; she’d always
                    liked Bác Xuân’s spot and said it’d gotten the most tra c. I bet she was planning to go for it right
                    when the rst opportunity came up.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Luckily gossip changes and some attention spans are short. Now the Mais’ restaurant
                    has become a fixture just like ours. But that doesn’t stop my mom’s competitive streak.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My parents&mdash;my mom, really&mdash;have now perfected the art of non-encounters,
                    knowing their schedule right down to when they close and when they leave. In a way, their schedule
                    has become ours. We’re background characters in each other’s stories.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">As I look at the poster in my hands, though, I wonder if it’s possible for us to
                    change up our scripts. What would happen if our families came face-to-face with each other like that
                    time at the temple? What would me and Linh say to each other?</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">“Tại sao mày đứng đó vậy</i>?<i class="calibre5">”</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sorry!” I shout to my mom. Back to work.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I fold up Linh’s poster and pocket it, not knowing why.</p>
