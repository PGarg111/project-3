# project-3

My project is a digital library called Story Haven. In this library the user will find popular books intended for middle and high schoolers. The website is divided using the different genres. To navigate the page you have to click on the different genres and then click on the book cover. Depending on whether the book is uploaded the user will see a page-not-found page or the actual book and be able to start reading. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this website. 

The features of the website include chapter buttons at the top and bottom of each reader page (after you clicked on the book cover). There are also buttons for the user to be able to increase/decrease the text size, play/pause music (it's relaxing piano music) while they read, toggle between dark/light theme, and return back to the main library if needed. When navigating through the buttons at the bottom of the page, the user will automatically be directed to the top of the next chapter. Because of how time consuming some of it was, the only reader pages available are 

Percy Jackson and the Lighting Thief, 
A Pho Love Story, 
The Downstairs Girl, 
Foolish Hearts, 
part of City Spies. 

The reader can see the whole series for the books which are part of a series on the genre pages. 

I made my website because as a reader, I struggle a lot with finding downloads for books or be able to read books for free online. Not everyone has the time to go to the library to get the book they want or be able to buy every book they want. Since I struggle and probably millions of others, I though it would be a great idea for a website. I also hate it when the free websites are plagued with random questionable adds which can get in the way of reading. In this website I prioritized easy navigation, comfort, and readability for the user. The music can provide a sense of comfort for readers who enjoy it when reading. 

My project was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the help of Calibre for converting PDF to HTML. 

My biggest challenges were with Javascript. Since it was my first time with Javascript, I went through a lot of tutorials, mostly on w3 schools. My biggest issue was that I couldn't write Javascript. I can look at Javascript and figure out what it's doing because of my knowledge with Python, but didn't know how to write. But learning Javascript and applying it to the website actually made my job easier. Before I was making a different page for each chapter, but with Javascript I was able to put all the chapters on one page and navigate using Javascript. The transfer of books into the website wasn't challenging at all, it was just time consuming, especially if the book converted wrong (I used Calibre for conversion).
