                <h2>CHAPTER 9: I AM OFFERED A QUEST</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                                    class="calibre12">T</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre5">HE NEXT
                        MORNING</span>, C<span class="calibre5">HIRON MOVED</span> me to cabin three. I didn‚Äôt have to
                    share with anybody. I had plenty of room for all my stuff: the Minotaur‚Äôs horn, one set of spare
                    clothes, and a toiletry bag. I got to sit at my own dinner table, pick all my own activities, call
                    ‚Äúlights out‚Äù whenever I felt like it, and not listen to anybody else.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">And I was absolutely miserable.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Just when I‚Äôd started to feel accepted, to feel I had a home in cabin eleven and I
                    might be a normal kid&mdash;or as normal as you can be when you‚Äôre a half-blood&mdash;I‚Äôd been
                    separated out as if I had some rare disease.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Nobody mentioned the hellhound, but I got the feeling they were all talking about
                    it behind my back. The attack had scared everybody. It sent two messages: one, that I was the son of
                    the Sea God; and two, monsters would stop at nothing to kill me. They could even invade a camp that
                    had always been considered safe.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-150" class="calibre17">The other campers steered clear of me as much as possible.
                    Cabin eleven was too nervous to have sword class with me after what I‚Äôd done to the Ares folks in
                    the woods, so my lessons with Luke became one-on-one. He pushed me harder than ever, and wasn‚Äôt
                    afraid to bruise me up in the process.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to need all the training you can get,‚Äù he promised, as we were
                    working with swords and flaming torches. ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs try that viper-beheading strike again. Fifty
                    more repetitions.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth still taught me Greek in the mornings, but she seemed distracted. Every
                    time I said something, she scowled at me, as if I‚Äôd just poked her between the eyes.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">After lessons, she would walk away muttering to herself: ‚ÄúQuest‚Ä¶ Poseidon?‚Ä¶Dirty
                    rotten‚Ä¶Got to make a plan‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Even Clarisse kept her distance, though her venomous looks made it clear she wanted
                    to kill me for breaking her magic spear. I wished she would just yell or punch me or something. I‚Äôd
                    rather get into fights every day than be ignored.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">I knew somebody at camp resented me, because one night I came into my cabin and
                    found a mortal newspaper dropped inside the doorway, a copy of the <i class="calibre7">New York
                        Daily News</i>, opened to the Metro page. The article took me almost an hour to read, because
                    the angrier I got, the more the words floated around on the page.</p>

                <p class="calibre6">ripped off and the front axle broken. The car had flipped and skidded</p>

                <p class="calibre3">Mother and son had gone for a weekend vacation to Montauk, but</p>
                <p class="calibre6">left hastily, under mysterious circumstances. Small traces of blood</p>
                <p class="calibre6">were found in the car and near the scene of the wreck, but there were</p>
                <p class="calibre6">no other signs of the missing Jacksons. Residents in the rural area</p>
                <p class="calibre6">reported seeing nothing unusual around the time of the accident.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="calibre17">The phone number was circled in black marker.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I wadded up the paper and threw it away, then flopped down in my bunk bed in the
                    middle of my empty cabin.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLights out,‚Äù I told myself miserably.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">That night, I had my worst dream yet.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I was running along the beach in a storm. This time, there was a city behind me.
                    Not New York. The sprawl was different: buildings spread farther apart, palm trees and low hills in
                    the distance.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">About a hundred yards down the surf, two men were fighting. They looked like TV
                    wrestlers, muscular, with beards and long hair. Both wore flowing Greek tunics, one trimmed in blue,
                    the other in green. They grappled with each other, wrestled, kicked and head-butted, and every time
                    they connected, lightning flashed, the sky grew darker, and the wind rose.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-152" class="calibre17">I had to stop them. I didn‚Äôt know why. But the harder I ran,
                    the more the wind blew me back, until I was running in place, my heels digging uselessly in the
                    sand.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Over the roar of the storm, I could hear the blue-robed one yelling at the
                    green-robed one, <i class="calibre7">Give it back! Give it back!</i> Like a kindergartner fighting
                    over a toy.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The waves got bigger, crashing into the beach, spraying me with salt.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I yelled, <i class="calibre7">Stop it! Stop fighting!</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">The ground shook. Laughter came from somewhere under the earth, and a voice so deep
                    and evil it turned my blood to ice.</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">Come down, little hero,</i> the voice crooned. <i
                        class="calibre7">Come down!</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">The sand split beneath me, opening up a crevice straight down to the center of the
                    earth. My feet slipped, and darkness swallowed me.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I woke up, sure I was falling.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I was still in bed in cabin three. My body told me it was morning, but it was dark
                    outside, and thunder rolled across the hills. A storm was brewing. I hadn‚Äôt dreamed that.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I heard a clopping sound at the door, a hoof knocking on the threshold.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome in?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover trotted inside, looking worried. ‚ÄúMr. D wants to see you.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHe wants to kill‚Ä¶I mean, I‚Äôd better let him tell you.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Nervously, I got dressed and followed, sure that I was in huge trouble.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">For days, I‚Äôd been half expecting a summons to the Big House. Now that I was
                    declared a son of Poseidon, one of the Big Three gods who weren‚Äôt supposed to have kids, I figured
                    it was a crime for me just to be alive. The other gods had probably been debating the best way to
                    punish me for existing, and now Mr. D was ready to deliver their verdict.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Over Long Island Sound, the sky looked like ink soup coming to a boil. A hazy
                    curtain of rain was coming in our direction. I asked Grover if we needed an umbrella.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt never rains here unless we want it to.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I pointed at the storm. ‚ÄúWhat the heck is that, then?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He glanced uneasily at the sky. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll pass around us. Bad weather always does.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">I realized he was right. In the week I‚Äôd been here, it had never even been
                    overcast. The few rain clouds I‚Äôd seen had skirted right around the edges of the valley.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre17">But this storm‚Ä¶this one was huge.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">At the volleyball pit, the kids from Apollo‚Äôs cabin were playing a morning game
                    against the satyrs. Dionysus‚Äôs twins were walking around in the strawberry fields, making the plants
                    grow. Everybody was going about their normal business, but they looked tense. They kept their eyes
                    on the storm.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover and I walked up to the front porch of the Big House. Dionysus sat at the
                    pinochle table in his tiger-striped Hawaiian shirt with his Diet Coke, just as he had on my first
                    day. Chiron sat across the table in his fake wheelchair. They were playing against invisible
                    opponents&mdash;two sets of cards hovering in the air.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù Mr. D said without looking up. ‚ÄúOur little celebrity.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I waited.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCome closer,‚Äù Mr. D said. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt expect me to kowtow to you, mortal, just
                    because old Barnacle-Beard is your father.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">A net of lightning flashed across the clouds. Thunder shook the windows of the
                    house.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBlah, blah, blah,‚Äù Dionysus said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron feigned interest in his pinochle cards. Grover cowered by the railing, his
                    hooves clopping back and forth.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf I had my way,‚Äù Dionysus said, ‚ÄúI would cause your molecules to erupt in flames.
                    We‚Äôd sweep up the ashes and be done with a lot of trouble. But Chiron seems to feel this would be
                    against my mission at this cursed camp: to keep you little brats safe from harm.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSpontaneous combustion <i class="calibre7">is</i> a form of harm, Mr. D,‚Äù Chiron
                    put in.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNonsense,‚Äù Dionysus said. ‚ÄúBoy wouldn‚Äôt feel a thing. Nevertheless, I‚Äôve agreed to
                    restrain myself. I‚Äôm thinking of turning you into a dolphin instead, sending you back to your
                    father.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúMr. D&mdash;‚Äù Chiron warned.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh, all right,‚Äù Dionysus relented. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one more option. But it‚Äôs deadly
                    foolishness.‚Äù Dionysus rose, and the invisible players‚Äô cards dropped to the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off to
                    Olympus for the emergency meeting. If the boy is still here when I get back, I‚Äôll turn him into an
                    Atlantic bottlenose. Do you understand? And Perseus Jackson, if you‚Äôre at all smart, you‚Äôll see
                    that‚Äôs a much more sensible choice than what Chiron feels you must do.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-154" class="calibre17">Dionysus picked up a playing card, twisted it, and it became
                    a plastic rectangle. A credit card? No. A security pass.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He snapped his fingers.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The air seemed to fold and bend around him. He became a hologram, then a wind, then
                    he was gone, leaving only the smell of fresh-pressed grapes lingering behind.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron smiled at me, but he looked tired and strained. ‚ÄúSit, Percy, please. And
                    Grover.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We did.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron laid his cards on the table, a winning hand he hadn‚Äôt gotten to use.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúTell me, Percy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat did you make of the hellhound?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Just hearing the name made me shudder.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron probably wanted me to say, <i class="calibre7">Heck, it was nothing. I eat
                        hellhounds for breakfast.</i> But I didn‚Äôt feel like lying.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIt scared me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you hadn‚Äôt shot it, I‚Äôd be dead.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôll meet worse, Percy. Far worse, before you‚Äôre done.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDone‚Ä¶with what?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYour quest, of course. Will you accept it?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I glanced at Grover, who was crossing his fingers.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúUm, sir,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt told me what it is yet.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron grimaced. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the hard part, the details.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Thunder rumbled across the valley. The storm clouds had now reached the edge of the
                    beach. As far as I could see, the sky and sea were boiling together.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPoseidon and Zeus,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fighting over something valuable‚Ä¶something
                    that was stolen, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron and Grover exchanged looks.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron sat forward in his wheelchair. ‚ÄúHow did you know that?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My face felt hot. I wished I hadn‚Äôt opened my big mouth. ‚ÄúThe weather since
                    Christmas has been weird, like the sea and the sky are fighting. Then I talked to Annabeth, and
                    she‚Äôd overheard something about a theft. And‚Ä¶I‚Äôve also been having these dreams.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù Grover said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHush, satyr,‚Äù Chiron ordered.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut it is his quest!‚Äù Grover‚Äôs eyes were bright with excitement. ‚ÄúIt must be!‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-155" class="calibre17">‚ÄúOnly the Oracle can determine.‚Äù Chiron stroked his bristly
                    beard. ‚ÄúNevertheless, Percy, you are correct. Your father and Zeus are having their worst quarrel in
                    centuries. They are fighting over something valuable that was stolen. To be precise: a lightning
                    bolt.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I laughed nervously. ‚ÄúA <i class="calibre7">what</i>?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDo not take this lightly,‚Äù Chiron warned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about some
                    tinfoil-covered zigzag you‚Äôd see in a second-grade play. I‚Äôm talking about a two-foot-long cylinder
                    of high-grade celestial bronze, capped on both ends with god-level explosives.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúZeus‚Äôs master bolt,‚Äù Chiron said, getting worked up now. ‚ÄúThe symbol of his power,
                    from which all other lightning bolts are patterned. The first weapon made by the Cyclopes for the
                    war against the Titans, the bolt that sheared the top off Mount Etna and hurled Kronos from his
                    throne; the master bolt, which packs enough power to make mortal hydrogen bombs look like
                    firecrackers.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs missing?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúStolen,‚Äù Chiron said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBy who?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBy <i class="calibre7">whom</i>,‚Äù Chiron corrected. Once a teacher, always a
                    teacher. ‚ÄúBy you.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My mouth fell open.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-156" class="calibre17">‚ÄúAt least‚Äù&mdash;Chiron held up a hand&mdash;‚Äúthat‚Äôs what
                    Zeus thinks. During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an
                    argument. The usual nonsense: ‚ÄòMother Rhea always liked you best,‚Äô ‚ÄòAir disasters are more
                    spectacular than sea disasters,‚Äô et cetera. Afterward, Zeus realized his master bolt was missing,
                    taken from the throne room under his very nose. He immediately blamed Poseidon. Now, a god cannot
                    usurp another god‚Äôs symbol of power directly&mdash;that is forbidden by the most ancient of divine
                    laws. But Zeus believes your father convinced a human hero to take it.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPatience and listen, child,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúZeus has good reason to be suspicious.
                    The forges of the Cyclopes are under the ocean, which gives Poseidon some influence over the makers
                    of his brother‚Äôs lightning. Zeus believes Poseidon has taken the master bolt, and is now secretly
                    having the Cyclopes build an arsenal of illegal copies, which might be used to topple Zeus from his
                    throne. The only thing Zeus wasn‚Äôt sure about was which hero Poseidon used to steal the bolt. Now
                    Poseidon has openly claimed you as his son. You were in New York over the winter holidays. You could
                    easily have snuck into Olympus. Zeus believes he has found his thief.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron and Grover glanced nervously at the sky. The clouds didn‚Äôt seem to be
                    parting around us, as Grover had promised. They were rolling straight over our valley, sealing us in
                    like a coffin lid.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúEr, Percy‚Ä¶?‚Äù Grover said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt use the <i class="calibre7">c</i>-word to
                    describe the Lord of the Sky.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPerhaps <i class="calibre7">paranoid</i>,‚Äù Chiron suggested. ‚ÄúThen again, Poseidon
                    has tried to unseat Zeus before. I believe that was question thirty-eight on your final exam‚Ä¶.‚Äù He
                    looked at me as if he actually expected me to remember question thirty-eight.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">How could anyone accuse me of stealing a god‚Äôs weapon? I couldn‚Äôt even steal a
                    slice of pizza from Gabe‚Äôs poker party without getting busted. Chiron was waiting for an answer.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomething about a golden net?‚Äù I guessed. ‚ÄúPoseidon and Hera and a few other
                    gods‚Ä¶they, like, trapped Zeus and wouldn‚Äôt let him out until he promised to be a better ruler,
                    right?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúAnd Zeus has never trusted Poseidon since. Of course,
                    Poseidon denies stealing the master bolt. He took great offense at the accusation. The two have been
                    arguing back and forth for months, threatening war. And now, you‚Äôve come along&mdash;the proverbial
                    last straw.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm just a kid!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy,‚Äù Grover cut in, ‚Äúif you were Zeus, and you already thought your brother was
                    plotting to overthrow you, then your brother suddenly admitted he had broken the sacred oath he took
                    after World War II, that he‚Äôs fathered a new mortal hero who might be used as a weapon against
                    you‚Ä¶Wouldn‚Äôt that put a twist in your toga?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt do anything. Poseidon&mdash;my dad&mdash;he didn‚Äôt really have this
                    master bolt stolen, did he?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron sighed. ‚ÄúMost thinking observers would agree that thievery is not Poseidon‚Äôs
                    style. But the Sea God is too proud to try convincing Zeus of that. Zeus has demanded that Poseidon
                    return the bolt by the summer solstice. That‚Äôs June twenty-first, ten days from now. Poseidon wants
                    an apology for being called a thief by the same date. I hoped that diplomacy might prevail, that
                    Hera or Demeter or Hestia would make the two brothers see sense. But your arrival has inflamed
                    Zeus‚Äôs temper. Now neither god will back down. Unless someone intervenes, unless the master bolt is
                    found and returned to Zeus before the solstice, there will be war. And do you know what a
                    full-fledged war would look like, Percy?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBad?‚Äù I guessed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúImagine the world in chaos. Nature at war with itself. Olympians forced to choose
                    sides between Zeus and Poseidon. Destruction. Carnage. Millions dead. Western civilization turned
                    into a battleground so big it will make the Trojan War look like a water-balloon fight.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBad,‚Äù I repeated.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd you, Percy Jackson, would be the first to feel Zeus‚Äôs wrath.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">It started to rain. Volleyball players stopped their game and stared in stunned
                    silence at the sky.</p>
                <p class="calibre17"><i class="calibre7">I</i> had brought this storm to Half-Blood Hill. Zeus was
                    punishing the whole camp because of me. I was furious.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo I have to find the stupid bolt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd return it to Zeus.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat better peace offering,‚Äù Chiron said, ‚Äúthan to have the son of Poseidon return
                    Zeus‚Äôs property?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf Poseidon doesn‚Äôt have it, where is the thing?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI believe I know.‚Äù Chiron‚Äôs expression was grim. ‚ÄúPart of a prophecy I had years
                    ago‚Ä¶well, some of the lines make sense to me, now. But before I can say more, you must officially
                    take up the quest. You must seek the counsel of the Oracle.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you tell me where the bolt is beforehand?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBecause if I did, you would be too afraid to accept the challenge.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I swallowed. ‚ÄúGood reason.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou agree then?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked at Grover, who nodded encouragingly.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Easy for him. I was the one Zeus wanted to kill.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than being turned into a dolphin.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs time you consulted the Oracle,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúGo upstairs, Percy
                    Jackson, to the attic. When you come back down, assuming you‚Äôre still sane, we will talk more.‚Äù</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">Four flights up, the stairs ended under a green trap-door.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I pulled the cord. The door swung down, and a wooden ladder clattered into place.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">The warm air from above smelled like mildew and rotten wood and something else‚Ä¶a
                    smell I remembered from biology class. Reptiles. The smell of snakes.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I held my breath and climbed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The attic was filled with Greek hero junk: armor stands covered in cobwebs;
                    once-bright shields pitted with rust; old leather steamer trunks plastered with stickers saying
                    <span class="calibre5">ITHAKA, CIRCE‚ÄôS ISLE</span>, and <span class="calibre5">LAND OF THE</span>
                    <span class="calibre5">AMAZONS</span> . One long table was stacked with glass jars filled with
                    pickled <i class="calibre7">things</i>&mdash;severed hairy claws, huge yellow eyes, various other
                    parts of monsters. A dusty mounted trophy on the wall looked like a giant snake‚Äôs head, but with
                    horns and a full set of shark‚Äôs teeth. The plaque read, <span class="calibre5">HYDRA</span> <span
                        class="calibre5">HEAD</span> #I, <span class="calibre5">WOODSTOCK, N.Y.</span>, 1969.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">By the window, sitting on a wooden tripod stool, was the most gruesome memento of
                    all: a mummy. Not the wrapped-in-cloth kind, but a human female body shriveled to a husk. She wore a
                    tie-dyed sundress, lots of beaded necklaces, and a headband over long black hair. The skin of her
                    face was thin and leathery over her skull, and her eyes were glassy white slits, as if the real eyes
                    had been replaced by marbles; she‚Äôd been dead a long, long time.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Looking at her sent chills up my back. And that was before she sat up on her stool
                    and opened her mouth. A green mist poured from the mummy‚Äôs mouth, coiling over the floor in thick
                    tendrils, hissing like twenty thousand snakes. I stumbled over myself trying to get to the trapdoor,
                    but it slammed shut. Inside my head, I heard a voice, slithering into one ear and coiling around my
                    brain: <i class="calibre7">I am the spirit of Delphi, speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo,
                        slayer of the mighty Python. Approach, seeker, and ask.</i></p>
                <p id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre17">I wanted to say, <i class="calibre7">No thanks, wrong door,
                        just looking for the bathroom.</i> But I forced myself to take a deep breath.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The mummy wasn‚Äôt alive. She was some kind of gruesome receptacle for something
                    else, the power that was now swirling around me in the green mist. But its presence didn‚Äôt feel
                    evil, like my demonic math teacher Mrs. Dodds or the Minotaur. It felt more like the Three Fates I‚Äôd
                    seen knitting the yarn outside the highway fruit stand: ancient, powerful, and definitely <i
                        class="calibre7">not</i> human. But not particularly interested in killing me, either.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I got up the courage to ask, ‚ÄúWhat is my destiny?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The mist swirled more thickly, collecting right in front of me and around the table
                    with the pickled monster-part jars. Suddenly there were four men sitting around the table, playing
                    cards. Their faces became clearer. It was Smelly Gabe and his buddies.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My fists clenched, though I knew this poker party couldn‚Äôt be real. It was an
                    illusion, made out of mist.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Gabe turned toward me and spoke in the rasping voice of the Oracle: <i
                        class="calibre7">You shall go west, and face the god who has turned.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">His buddy on the right looked up and said in the same voice: <i
                        class="calibre7">You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">The guy on the left threw in two poker chips, then said: <i class="calibre7">You
                        shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">Finally, Eddie, our building super, delivered the worst line of all: <i
                        class="calibre7">And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre17">The figures began to dissolve. At first I was too stunned to say anything, but as
                    the mist retreated, coiling into a huge green serpent and slithering back into the mouth of the
                    mummy, I cried, ‚ÄúWait! What do you mean? What friend? What will I fail to save?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The tail of the mist snake disappeared into the mummy‚Äôs mouth. She reclined back
                    against the wall. Her mouth closed tight, as if it hadn‚Äôt been open in a hundred years. The attic
                    was silent again, abandoned, nothing but a room full of mementos.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre17">I got the feeling that I could stand here until I had
                    cobwebs, too, and I wouldn‚Äôt learn anything else.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My audience with the Oracle was over.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Chiron asked me.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I slumped into a chair at the pinochle table. ‚ÄúShe said I would retrieve what was
                    stolen.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre17">Grover sat forward, chewing excitedly on the remains of a
                    Diet Coke can. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great!‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhat did the Oracle say <i class="calibre7">exactly</i>?‚Äù Chiron pressed. ‚ÄúThis is
                    important.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My ears were still tingling from the reptilian voice. ‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶she said I would go west
                    and face a god who had turned. I would retrieve what was stolen and see it safely returned.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù Grover said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron didn‚Äôt look satisfied. ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I didn‚Äôt want to tell him.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">What friend would betray me? I didn‚Äôt have that many.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">And the last line&mdash;I would fail to save what mattered most. What kind of
                    Oracle would send me on a quest and tell me, <i class="calibre7">Oh, by the way, you‚Äôll fail.</i>
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">How could I confess that?</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about it.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He studied my face. ‚ÄúVery well, Percy. But know this: the Oracle‚Äôs words often have
                    double meanings. Don‚Äôt dwell on them too much. The truth is not always clear until events come to
                    pass.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I got the feeling he knew I was holding back something bad, and he was trying to
                    make me feel better.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, anxious to change topics. ‚ÄúSo where do I go? Who‚Äôs this god in the
                    west?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAh, think, Percy,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúIf Zeus and Poseidon weaken each other in a war,
                    who stands to gain?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSomebody else who wants to take over?‚Äù I guessed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, quite. Someone who harbors a grudge, who has been unhappy with his lot since
                    the world was divided eons ago, whose kingdom would grow powerful with the deaths of millions.
                    Someone who hates his brothers for forcing him into an oath to have no more children, an oath that
                    both of them have now broken.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I thought about my dreams, the evil voice that had spoken from the ground. ‚ÄúHades.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron nodded. ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Dead is the only possibility.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">A scrap of aluminum dribbled out of Grover‚Äôs mouth. ‚ÄúWhoa, wait. Wh-what?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA Fury came after Percy,‚Äù Chiron reminded him. ‚ÄúShe watched the young man until
                    she was sure of his identity, then tried to kill him. Furies obey only one lord: Hades.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYes, but&mdash;but Hades hates <i class="calibre7">all</i>
                    heroes,‚Äù Grover protested. ‚ÄúEspecially if he has found out Percy is a son of Poseidon‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA hellhound got into the forest,‚Äù Chiron continued. ‚ÄúThose can only be summoned
                    from the Fields of Punishment, and it had to be summoned by someone within the camp. Hades must have
                    a spy here. He must suspect Poseidon will try to use Percy to clear his name. Hades would very much
                    like to kill this young half-blood before he can take on the quest.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs two major gods who want to kill me.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúBut a quest to‚Ä¶‚Äù Grover swallowed. ‚ÄúI mean, couldn‚Äôt the master bolt be in some
                    place like Maine? Maine‚Äôs very nice this time of year.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúHades sent a minion to steal the master bolt,‚Äù Chiron insisted. ‚ÄúHe hid it in the
                    Underworld, knowing full well that Zeus would blame Poseidon. I don‚Äôt pretend to understand the Lord
                    of the Dead‚Äôs motives perfectly, or why he chose this time to start a war, but one thing is certain.
                    Percy must go to the Underworld, find the master bolt, and reveal the truth.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">A strange fire burned in my stomach. The weirdest thing was: it wasn‚Äôt fear. It was
                    anticipation. The desire for revenge. Hades had tried to kill me three times so far, with the Fury,
                    the Minotaur, and the hellhound. It was his fault my mother had disappeared in a flash of light. Now
                    he was trying to frame me and my dad for a theft we hadn‚Äôt committed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I was ready to take him on.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Besides, if my mother was in the Underworld‚Ä¶</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Whoa, boy, said the small part of my brain that was still sane. You‚Äôre a kid. Hades
                    is a god.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover was trembling. He‚Äôd started eating pinochle cards like potato chips.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The poor guy needed to complete a quest with me so he could get his searcher‚Äôs
                    license, whatever that was, but how could I ask him to do this quest, especially when the Oracle
                    said I was destined to fail? This was suicide.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúLook, if we know it‚Äôs Hades,‚Äù I told Chiron, ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt we just tell the other
                    gods? Zeus or Poseidon could go down to the Underworld and bust some heads.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSuspecting and knowing are not the same,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúBesides, even if the other
                    gods suspect Hades&mdash;and I imagine Poseidon does&mdash;they couldn‚Äôt retrieve the bolt
                    themselves. Gods cannot cross each other‚Äôs territories except by invitation. That is another ancient
                    rule. Heroes, on the other hand, have certain privileges. They can go anywhere, challenge anyone, as
                    long as they‚Äôre bold enough and strong enough to do it. No god can be held responsible for a hero‚Äôs
                    actions. Why do you think the gods always operate through humans?‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm being used.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs no accident Poseidon has claimed you now. It‚Äôs a very risky
                    gamble, but he‚Äôs in a desperate situation. He needs you.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My dad needs me.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Emotions rolled around inside me like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. I didn‚Äôt
                    know whether to feel resentful or grateful or happy or angry. Poseidon had ignored me for twelve
                    years. Now suddenly he needed me.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked at Chiron. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve known I was Poseidon‚Äôs son all along, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI had my suspicions. As I said‚Ä¶I‚Äôve spoken to the Oracle, too.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I got the feeling there was a lot he wasn‚Äôt telling me about his prophecy, but I
                    decided I couldn‚Äôt worry about that right now. After all, I was holding back information too.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúSo let me get this straight,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to go to the Underworld and
                    confront the Lord of the Dead.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCheck,‚Äù Chiron said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúFind the most powerful weapon in the universe.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúCheck.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúAnd get it back to Olympus before the summer solstice, in ten days.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about right.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I looked at Grover, who gulped down the ace of hearts.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúDid I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year?‚Äù he asked weakly.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt ask that of you.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù He shifted his hooves. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just that satyrs and underground
                    places‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He took a deep breath, then stood, brushing the shredded cards and aluminum bits
                    off his T-shirt. ‚ÄúYou saved my life, Percy. If‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre serious about wanting me along, I won‚Äôt let
                    you down.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I felt so relieved I wanted to cry, though I didn‚Äôt think that would be very
                    heroic. Grover was the only friend I‚Äôd ever had for longer than a few months. I wasn‚Äôt sure what
                    good a satyr could do against the forces of the dead, but I felt better knowing he‚Äôd be with me.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-165" class="calibre17">‚ÄúAll the way, G-man.‚Äù I turned to Chiron. ‚ÄúSo where do we go?
                    The Oracle just said to go west.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThe entrance to the Underworld is always in the west. It moves from age to age,
                    just like Olympus. Right now, of course, it‚Äôs in America.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron looked surprised. ‚ÄúI thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance to
                    the Underworld is in Los Angeles.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNaturally. So we just get on a plane&mdash;‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Grover shrieked. ‚ÄúPercy, what are you thinking? Have you ever been on a plane
                    in your life?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I shook my head, feeling embarrassed. My mom had never taken me anywhere by plane.
                    She‚Äôd always said we didn‚Äôt have the money. Besides, her parents had died in a plane crash.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúPercy, think,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúYou are the son of the Sea God. Your father‚Äôs
                    bitterest rival is Zeus, Lord of the Sky. Your mother knew better than to trust you in an airplane.
                    You would be in Zeus‚Äôs domain. You would never come down again alive.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Overhead, lightning crackled. Thunder boomed.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, determined not to look at the storm. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôll travel overland.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúTwo companions may accompany you. Grover is one. The
                    other has already volunteered, if you will accept her help.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúGee,‚Äù I said, feigning surprise. ‚ÄúWho else would be stupid enough to volunteer for
                    a quest like this?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The air shimmered behind Chiron.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth became visible, stuffing her Yankees cap into her back pocket.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting a long time for a quest, Seaweed Brain,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAthena is no
                    fan of Poseidon, but if you‚Äôre going to save the world, I‚Äôm the best person to keep you from messing
                    up.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúIf you do say so yourself,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI suppose you have a plan, Wise Girl?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Her cheeks colored. ‚ÄúDo you want my help or not?‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The truth was, I did. I needed all the help I could get.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúA trio,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll work.‚Äù</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúThis afternoon, we can take you as far as the bus
                    terminal in Manhattan. After that, you are on your own.‚Äù</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-166" class="calibre17">Lightning flashed. Rain poured down on the meadows that were
                    never supposed to have violent weather.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">‚ÄúNo time to waste,‚Äù Chiron said. ‚ÄúI think you should all get packing.‚Äù</p>
