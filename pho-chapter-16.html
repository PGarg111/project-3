                <h3>Chapter 16</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">It’s not that I didn’t know I was liar. But to hear someone else agree with that?
                    It’s piercing. Especially coming from Bảo, because as much as I dislike the label, I know he’s
                    right. Lying to maintain stability. Lying to make sure my parents aren’t worrying about me or
                    nagging me because they already have to do that as parents. In a way, isn’t this saving my parents
                    from grief? He’s doing it, too. That’s the only reason why we’re able to do this whole food beat.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">But it’s never going to stop if you go on like this</i>, says a
                    voice unusually like Bảo’s.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I yell in frustration, glad to have the house to myself for an hour. My parents are
                    still at the restaurant. My sketch from earlier tonight is beside me, nearly done. I just have to
                    add more depth perception. I run my hand across its rough texture.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bảo can’t know the pressure. From what I can tell, his parents aren’t forcing him
                    to be something&mdash;they just want him to nd his path, which he said he couldn’t see, but
                    observing him tonight, writing seems to come naturally to him.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I force down the sudden spike of jealousy; his parents are clearly different from
                    mine.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">It felt normal in the beginning. If other people were looking in, we probably
                    seemed like two high school students on a real date. When I’m with Ali, I can talk about a lot of
                    things, but she can’t understand being raised the way me and Evie were. We grew up differently.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I smile at the memory of watching him try to tame his hair. He didn’t know I was
                    there. I can’t be sure, but I feel as if his hair is the type to grow faster than it should. I like
                    it long, better than his bowl cut&mdash;for obvious reasons. It’s the kind of hair that’d be easy to
                    run through with your hands.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre12">My hand. I glance down.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">In my reverie, I was starting to outline the shape of his head. I rub at the image,
                    smudging the lines.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">But of course I botched the conversation. I panicked when he pressed me about
                    lying. The moment he mentioned lying, I denied it, but I was denying the truth. I shouldn’t have
                    shut down. I wouldn’t be surprised if Bảo told Ali the next day that he can’t work the beat anymore.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">It’d be another lie to say that that wouldn’t hurt me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How was dinner with Ali?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Flipping over my sketchbook, even though there’s nothing to give me away, I look
                    up. Right: my excuse. Mẹ had come back from work at some point. I hear Ba over in their room,
                    opening and closing drawers, getting ready for bed.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Good. We ate ramen.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ makes a face. She’s not a huge fan, claiming it’s too salty for her taste. As
                    she comes over, I shove the sketchbook under my pillow.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Mẹ missed a call from Dì Vàng. Let’s see why she called.” Mẹ sits on my bed, and
                    scoots back so that she’s against the wall like me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">After a few rings on Viber, my aunt appears onscreen in all of her familiar
                    late-morning, <i class="calibre5">I was sculpting all last night for fun</i> grogginess. Her large
                    black-rimmed glasses sit at the end of her nose. She’s still in her pajamas, light green elephants
                    printed on the sleeves. My mom has a similar set; the material is perfect for the heat here, too. Dì
                    Vàng is in her apartment’s kitchen, a cup of <i class="calibre5">cà phê đen</i> beside her. If I
                    strain enough I might be able to hear the motorcycles outside her window, some neighborhood women
                    laughing, loitering on the sidewalk, or a vendor hawking sh or fresh veggies.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Did you just wake up?” my mom asks. It’s eleven in the morning over there, too
                    late for Mẹ’s typical wake-up time at dawn.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Maybe.” <i class="calibre5">Knew it.</i> My aunt makes a show of yawning and
                    stretching. “What did you eat for dinner?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Leftovers. And you?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre12">I roll my eyes. They say hi and immediately ask about food?
                    My aunt points the phone downward to show her plate of <i class="calibre5">ốp la&mdash;</i>fried
                    eggs, the yolk runny once pierced&mdash;with <i class="calibre5">bánh mì</i>, likely fresh from next
                    door.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Where’s the <i class="calibre5">xì dầu</i>?” Mẹ asks almost accusingly.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Chị trying to diet. Less salt. It’s perfectly ne without it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You sound Mỹ,” Mẹ says. I grin, thinking about how much my mom acts like the older
                    sister even though she isn’t. My aunt knows how to take it, though, shooting back playful replies.
                    Oh yes, I can see it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So, what’s happening? You don’t usually call me. It’s the other way around.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Did you get my vase?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yes. You shouldn’t have sent it. It costs so much money to ship things over.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I wanted to give you something nice! But if you’re that worried about money, maybe
                    I should just deliver my next one to you myself.” Dì Vàng leans closer, grinning now. Her eyes are
                    alive.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Does she mean… ?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Are you coming here?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Are you?” I ask, pulling the phone from Mẹ’s hand. She snatches it back.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re coming here, really?” she asks again.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yes, it’s been way too long. Twelve, thirteen years?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“When are you coming?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Around Tết.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re leaving around Tết? But why? It’s the best holiday. Tra c will be
                    horrible.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Dì Vàng laughs. “Of course you’re already worrying about the travel schedule!
                    Anyway, I’ve seen so many Tết; I live here. Plus it’s been so long! I want to see you. I want to hug
                    Evie and Linh!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That can’t be the only reason.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I also might be visiting some artist friends on the West Coast.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You have friends here?” I ask, though I shouldn’t be surprised. When she visited
                    the last time, she managed to make conversation with everyone on the</p>
                <p class="calibre4">oor of our old apartment building, people my parents and I never even</p>
                <p class="calibre1">interacted with. She even met Bác Xuân when he came by, and in no time they were
                    trading hypotheticals on what he would do when he retired and moved closer to his adult children and
                    their families.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre12">“I have friends all over the place. I’m international.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I can’t believe you’re coming,” I say excitedly. It’ll be two artists under one
                    roof. We’ll go to museums, I’ll show her my work. Someone who will understand my language. And
                    support it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Do you have enough money to go traveling?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Dì Vàng tuts at my mom. “Of course I do. My business is good over here; I wish you
                    believed me.” She leans in again, seeing something in my mom’s expression that I must have missed.
                    “I am no longer a struggling artist, as you seem to think I will always be.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’ve struggled for a long time, I remember.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I know; I remember too. But I am ne. You shouldn’t worry too much, <i
                        class="calibre5">em</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ holds back whatever thought she has and they move on to talking about old
                    friends, some woman they knew who’d eloped in Hội An, then came back without the husband recently. I
                    sit there, silent, content to listen, eyes tracking the level of my aunt’s co ee as she sips away at
                    it. Then Mẹ notices my eyes closing slowly. The ramen is finally kicking in, lulling me to sleep.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Okay, <i class="calibre5">cho</i> Linh <i class="calibre5">đi ngủ</i>.” They
                    exchange goodbyes, my aunt saying she’d circle back with more info about her visit next year.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ only sighs as she maneuvers herself o my bed.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Be happy, Mẹ!” I say, holding on to my mom’s arm before she leaves, trying to get
                    her not to worry already. “Your sister’s coming over.” I see a hint of a smile blooming on her face,
                    though she stops herself, shooing away my hand.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I really don’t know what she’s thinking. She’s so unpredictable. And she shouldn’t
                    spend her money so freely.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Was it really that bad? Dì Vàng and her sculpting business.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“She’d just started it when she was seventeen right after leaving school. Then
                    rationings were happening and the government was watching anyone who was against <i
                        class="calibre5">cộng sản</i> very closely. They stole part of our land, leaving little to us.”
                    My mom fiddles with the back of her phone cover. “Many times Dì Vàng would come home without making
                    any sales.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So what happened?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre12">“Luckily, we had older aunts and uncles who would come in and
                    out, making sure we were fed. That is the Vietnamese way. But still, Mẹ <i class="calibre5">biết
                        nghề nghiệp của</i> Dì Vàng would not help us. Art was only for fun. And during that time, there
                    was no time for playing.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“At the camps, when Mẹ finally made it&mdash;just <i class="calibre5">mười hai
                        tuổi</i>&mdash;I promised I would work hard. So that we would su er less. So that Mẹ could help
                    your aunt back home.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom was fourteen by the time they left the camps and were accepted into the
                    United States with her cousins and two other refugees they’d grown close to. But she couldn’t depend
                    on her cousins alone&mdash;they too were thrust into an unfamiliar place with minimal
                    English&mdash;and finding work was hard. So, when she wasn’t studying to catch up at school, she was
                    working odd jobs. Some of the money went to their daily expenses. Whatever was left over she’d send
                    back to Vietnam, to help my aunt.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ah, <i class="calibre5">Mẹ nhức đầu</i>,” she says, massaging her temples, worries
                    about my aunt plaguing her mind. Then she’s o to the next room, muttering about how much she’ll need
                    to clean up to accommodate her sister coming over, despite us having plenty of time to prepare.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I still don’t understand. My aunt seems so happy, and she’s managed to get this
                    far, and it can’t all be because she gets some money now and then from America. She’s not struggling
                    like before, so why can’t my mom see that it all turned out okay in the end? It’s like the memories
                    of my aunt’s struggle keep her from seeing the good sides to art.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I pull out my sketchpad from its hiding place and trace over the image of Bảo. I
                    barely remember doing this drawing; I was just lost in the act of doing it. It’s a type of
                    forgetting that I love, that I can’t get anywhere else. Inside my head, I can just <i
                        class="calibre5">be</i>. My aunt must know this too.</p>
