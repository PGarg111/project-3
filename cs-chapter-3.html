                <h2><strong>3.</strong> Brooklyn</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre16">Rather than a prisoner transport</span> bus, Sara left the
                    courthouse in a limousine with two people who claimed to be spies. Surprisingly, she had no doubt
                    that that’s exactly what they were. She just wasn’t sure how she fit into their plans.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Let me get this straight,” she said as they took Atlantic Avenue deeper into
                    Brooklyn. “You two are a team?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Part of one,” answered Sydney.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And you came here to see if I was a good fit for that team?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s right,” said Mother.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Am I?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“So far, it’s quite promising,” he said, “but we can’t be certain until we conduct
                    some more tests.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean, <i class="calibre8">more</i> tests?” she said. “I haven’t taken
                    any.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Actually, you’ve taken two so far,” he answered. “First when I asked you to hack
                    into the juvenile justice portal and make me your attorney. That’s performance under pressure. An
                    essential skill.” He turned to Sydney. “She did it in under two minutes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Impressive,” said Sydney.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“The second was trusting me in the courtroom,” he continued. “That demonstrated
                    your ability to adapt to rapidly changing situations. Also essential.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I wish I could’ve been there to see it,” said Sydney.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“It’s too bad,” joked Mother. “I was sensational.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-28" class="calibre17">Sydney rolled her eyes and shared a look with Sara. “By the
                    way, I did some shopping earlier.” Sydney handed her two department store bags. “I tried to guess
                    your sizes and what you might like.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Sara looked in the bags. “You bought me clothes?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Just to hold you over until we can get you a proper wardrobe,” she replied.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Although, most days you’ll wear your school uniform,” added Mother.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Sara gave him a curious look. “My school doesn’t have a uniform.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“About that. You’re going to be enrolled in a new school called Kinloch Abbey.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Sounds about as fake as Crunchem Hall,” she said. “Let me guess. It’s from <i
                        class="calibre8">James and the Giant Peach</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No, this one’s not in a book,” Mother said. “It’s in Scotland.” Sara waited for
                    him to laugh, but he didn’t. She waited some more, but there was still no laugh.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’re serious?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“It’s a bit posh,” said Sydney. “After all, part of it’s in a castle. But once you
                    get over that, you’ll like it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We’re going to Scotland?!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Instead of answering, Mother leaned toward the driver and asked, “Can you please
                    turn left and take us to house number 197?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We’re pressed for time,” Sydney reminded him. “If we miss this flight, we’ll lose
                    an entire day.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I know, I know,” he reassured her. “It’s just a quick detour for context. Besides,
                    I really want to see it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m sorry,” Sara interrupted, “but can we get back to the whole Scotland thing?”
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-29" class="calibre17">“Shortly,” Mother assured her as the limo parked in front of a
                    three-story redbrick town house. “First, tell me what you know about Winston Churchill.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Absolutely nothing,” she said blankly. “The name sounds … kind of familiar, but
                    that’s it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Jaw-dropping,” he said disapprovingly. “Kinloch will take care of that in a tick.
                    But, for now, just know that as prime minister during World War Two, Churchill saved Britain and
                    quite possibly the world from annihilation. He’s a personal hero of mine and did more for the
                    British Secret Intelligence Service than anyone else.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Okay,” she said. “So why are you telling me this?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Because his mother was born in this house.” He gestured out the window. “Think
                    about that. The mother of the man who saved Britain wasn’t from London or Oxford or some grand
                    estate out in Surrey. She was from Brooklyn, just like you. So it follows that we’d come full circle
                    back here to find you. Brooklyn’s imprinted on our DNA.” He turned his attention back to the driver.
                    “Okay,we can move along now.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The limo started again.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s interesting and all,” said Sara. “But it really doesn’t answer my question.
                    Are you seriously taking me to Scotland? Because I don’t even have a passport.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He popped open his briefcase and handed her two British passports, each with her
                    picture and a phony name. “Pick the one you like better.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Of course,” she replied, shaking her head. “You have all the passports you want.
                    How’d you get this picture of me?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That bit about us being spies?” he said. “We’re exceptionally good at getting
                    things. As to your first question, yes, we’re taking you to Scotland. Whether you stay there or not,
                    however, will be entirely up to you.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-30" class="calibre17">“How do you mean?” she asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Soon you’ll start classes at Kinloch. It’s one of the top boarding schools in the
                    UK. You’ll get a first-rate education. And if you’re happy there, you can continue until you
                    graduate and leave for university. That’s option one.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And if I don’t like it?” she asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Option two,” he answered. “If, at the end of the school year, you decide Kinloch’s
                    not right for you or that you miss living in the States too much, we’ll find you a proper home back
                    here in America. It won’t be like the ones you’ve been stuck in before. We’ll get you a good family.
                    I’ll see to that. Although, we might want to avoid metropolitan New York because of the whole
                    business about them believing that you’re in detention somewhere.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Good point,” she said. “But what does any of that have to do with spies and MI6?”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Not a thing.” He leaned in conspiratorially and added, “Option three is the one
                    that involves the Secret Intelligence Service.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She looked at both of them before saying, “Then option three is the one I want to
                    hear about.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You attend Kinloch not as a boarder but as a day student,” said Sydney. “And you
                    live at the farm with Monty, me, and the rest of the team.” “Monty?” asked Sara. “Who’s that?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Dr. Alexandra Montgomery,” said Mother. “She’s a biophysicist-slash-cryptologist
                    who loves to bake. Think of her as part Marie Curie and part Mary Poppins.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“She’s brilliant,” said Sydney. “You’re going to love her.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And the rest of the team?” asked Sara.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Kids like you and me who Mother’s found around the globe,” said Sydney. “They’re
                    amazing.” She rethought this for a moment. “I mean, the boys totally drive me bonkers and I usually
                    want to strangle them, but other than that they’re amazing.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“How many are there?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Two boys and another girl,” she said. “Paris, Rio, and Kat. When you join the
                    team, you have to create an entirely new identity. It’s hard to keep track of all the aliases and
                    fake names, so we just call each other by where we’re from. That way we still have a small
                    connection to our past.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“There’s a city called Kat?” asked Sara.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Kathmandu,” answered Mother. “It’s in Nepal but that’s rather a mouthful, so we
                    just go with Kat.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That means I’d be Brooklyn,” Sara said, liking the sound of it.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre8">If</i> you decide to join,” stressed Mother.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What does <i class="calibre8">joining</i> even mean?” she asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“It means that in addition to your studies at Kinloch,” he said, “you’ll receive
                    instruction in espionage, counterintelligence, self-defense, code-breaking, and other assorted
                    goodies.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“My favorite assorted goody is explosives,” said Sydney. “I like making things go
                    boom.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“So we’re talking spy school?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” said Mother. “But not just school. We go on real missions. We face genuine
                    danger.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And you said that there’s a mission coming up that you want me to go on,” Sara
                    replied.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Mother sighed. “Normally, you receive extensive training before you go into the
                    field, but we’re in a pinch at the moment. There’s an operation in three weeks, and we find
                    ourselves one person down.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And if that person’s me?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Then I would limit your role as much as possible, but you would have to go into
                    the field with us.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-32" class="calibre17">“Cool,” she said with a grin. “Sounds more fun than juvenile
                    detention.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Sara would’ve asked more about the upcoming mission, but she was distracted when
                    the limo turned down a familiar street. It was >her neighborhood and just the sight of it made her
                    wince. Everything here was the opposite of boarding schools and castles. There were chain-link
                    fences with razor wire, iron bars on windows, and graffiti covering the wall of an abandoned
                    warehouse.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Why are we here?” she asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“We’re about to cross an ocean,” he answered. “I thought you might like to stop by
                    home before we left .”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“This isn’t my <i class="calibre8">home</i>,” she corrected. “It’s a <i
                        class="calibre8">house</i> where I lived. There’s a huge difference.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Duly noted,” he said. “But either way, you won’t be returning.</p>
                <p class="calibre1">If there’s anything of sentimental value in there, now’s the time.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“There’s a shoebox with some things that are special to me,” she said. “But I can’t
                    get it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Why not?” he asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“The Clarks are home,” she said. “Considering I just tried to have them arrested, I
                    doubt they’ll hand it over.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Then let’s not tell them,” he replied.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You want me to break in?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“In the spy trade we call it a ‘black bag job,’ ” he said. “We’ll make this your
                    first alpha test.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">This brought a smile to Sydney’s face. “I like it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What’s an alpha test?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Every mission has a team leader, called an <i class="calibre8">alpha</i>, who
                    comes up with the plan and runs the operation,” he explained. “To prepare for that, we run alpha
                    tests as practice.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre17">“Except, I haven’t had any training,” Sara replied. “I don’t
                    know how to plan a mission.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Don’t sell yourself short,” Sydney said firmly. “You already have the intel.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Sara gave her a confused look.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“The intelligence,” Sydney explained. “You know the inner workings of the house.
                    All you have to do is break down the variables and devise a scheme. For example, who’s inside right
                    now?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Sara checked her watch. “It should just be the Clarks,” she said. “The kids are all
                    either at day care or after-school programs for another forty-five minutes.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Excellent, so we only have two people to deal with,” said Mother. “Where’s the
                    shoebox?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“On the top shelf of my bedroom closet … which is on the third floor.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s not ideal,” said Mother.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And the only way to get there is to go through the living room, where I’m sure
                    Leonard is sitting in his recliner watching television and drinking a beer.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Also less than ideal,” he said. “But it’s still clear-cut. You just need some sort
                    of bait that will get them out of the way.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s called the nugget,” said Sydney.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“The nugget?” Sara asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Something to distract them,” answered Sydney. “To lure them from the living room.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What do they find … <i class="calibre8">irresistible</i>?” asked Mother.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Beer … pizza&nbsp; …” Sara continued thinking as she studied the house. For her it
                    was filled with memories of sadness and disappointment. She looked up at the roof where she and
                    Gabriel had been locked out for an entire night. And that’s when the brainstorm hit. “… and money!”
                    she said. “They love money.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I don’t think we have enough cash for a bribe,” said Mother.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s okay,” Sara replied. “Just the idea of money should be enough to get them.
                    Can you pass yourself off as an FBI agent?” “I’d need a wardrobe change,” Mother said. He opened his
                    briefcase and pulled out a black tie, which he swapped with the stylish patterned one he was
                    wearing. Then he took out his pocket square and put on a pair of dark sunglasses.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Wardrobe change complete,” he said. “What’s the plan?”</p>
                </p>
