                <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">Of course, when I was walking with Bảo, I didn’t mean to give the chocolate milk to
                    him. I didn’t finish it at lunch, felt guilty throwing it away&mdash;my parents’ voices reprimanding
                    me&mdash;so I carried it for my next class. Then I saw Bảo at his locker, and before I even knew it,
                    my legs were carrying me across the hallway and suddenly: chocolate milk. If Ali saw that, she
                    would’ve never let me live it down.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I dip my brush into a jar of water, washing it of cadmium yellow. Yamamoto’s voice
                    is on background as she talks to the class, weaving in between each student to check on their work.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">Bảo has snuck his way into my brain for the last few days. I turn into a mess every
                    time I see him, which is more than I can ever remember. There’s a theory that we’ve talked about in
                    my psychology class called red car syndrome, where you hear or see something once, like a red car,
                    and suddenly you see red cars everywhere. I don’t remember seeing Bảo so many times in the
                    hallway&mdash;or maybe I’ve trained myself to see past him&mdash;but I’ve turned a corner several
                    times before pivoting in the opposite direction. Just the other day at work, while my dad was
                    passing along details on where to meet Quyền Thành, which happens to be today, I was sneaking looks
                    at the window, hoping to catch sight of Bảo through his. My mom wondered aloud if I should dress up
                    for the interview.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Linh.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Could we really work together?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Had Ali planned to pair us the moment the idea came to mind, or was it after I told
                    her about Bảo and Phở Day? I make a note to bring it up later.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">“Linhhhh.”</i></p>
                <p id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre12">But the question is: <i class="calibre5">How are we ever going
                        to do this?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Linh!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Yamamoto is right by my ear. I yelp and my brush falls out of my hand and clatters
                    on the oor. Classmates, now busy packing up, snicker. Yamamoto stands before me, arms akimbo, but
                    while other teachers would be pissed o , she only appears amused, a stampede of questions probably
                    in her mind.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You know, I’ve seen you get lost inside your brain before, but never like this. I
                    mean, you were <i class="calibre5">far</i> gone,” she says teasingly.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Blushing, I hurriedly fold up my tarp and place my canvas on a tabletop by other
                    day-old canvases. Just a bunch of fruits in baskets and flowers&mdash;beginning paint classes. I wash
                    my brushes with an odorless thinner&mdash;I hate the citrus kind &mdash;before wiping them dry, then
                    running them under water with some linseed soap. The usual next step is futile. I wash my hands
                    until most of the paint has disappeared. I’ve stopped worrying about the rest on my fingers; it all
                    eventually just fades. The bell rings and I push my way out into the hallway.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Inside my jeans pocket, my phone buzzes. I have a half hour until I have to meet
                    with Quyền Thành, learn about the <i class="calibre5">fascinating</i> world of engineering.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hey, lady,” my best friend says casually at my locker. But I know her better and
                    read the gleam in her eyes. She wants to talk about Bảo. I don’t think she’d ever been more excited
                    than after hearing me tell her about Phở Day. “Wow, I didn’t know he had it in him,” Ali had said in
                    mock surprise.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How was art class?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I roll my eyes at her. “Is that the question you really want to ask?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, but I’m a journalist. I have to throw out questions to warm you up. But now
                    that you mention it: What do you think? Are you going to work with Bảo?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ali.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“C’mon, it’ll be <i class="calibre5">fun</i>.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Wouldn’t use that word.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What would you use?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Full of dread. Confused. Perplexed&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That’s a synonym.” She waits for me to switch out my textbooks, smoothly catching
                    one that jumps out at her. She reads the title before shelving it. “Psychology&mdash;well, that’s
                    saying something.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-69" class="calibre12">“My question is: How the hell will this work? Our families
                    hate each other. We know <i class="calibre5">nothing</i> about each other. I feel like I’m breaking
                    several rules just by agreeing to this&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She holds up two hands, telling me to slow down. “I already worked out the</p>
                <p class="calibre4">rst question. I’ll just nd restaurants that are a little farther outside the radius
                </p>
                <p class="calibre1">of where your parents tend to go. Aren’t you always telling me that your parents or
                    people they know never eat out because your mom&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“&mdash;says she can make anything at home.” Evie and I used to beg our parents to
                    take us to McDonalds for Happy Meals.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Exactly.” She signs the number two. “Second, I’m well aware of this feud. I don’t
                    get it, but I’m not supposed to. But it’s your families who despise each other. What about you? For
                    once, let’s just remove the whole family situation&mdash; if it’s just you and Bảo standing across
                    from each other, would you say that you like him?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’d be very easy to like him.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She smiles knowingly. After a few seconds of delay, my words catch up to me. My
                    face warms up. “Seems like you already do like him.” She pauses dramatically. “Maybe even more than
                    that.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I close my mouth, reaching out to shut my locker door that dangled between us. The
                    afternoon rush around us seems more muted than it usually is, the crowd owing naturally around us.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Like him</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My phone buzzes again. Fifteen minutes until the meeting.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I don’t have time for this right now.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ali nods in agreement, like she’s just read my mind. “Things like this don’t really
                    wait for you to catch up. Like the way you end up drawing something you never intended to draw. Just
                    think about it: When you <i class="calibre5">like</i> an art piece, how much of it is thinking and
                    how much of it is feeling?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">There are artists and fans interested in artwork on an intellectual level; they
                    consider the message of the piece, the intention of the artist, the connotations of the time and
                    place of its creation. Yamamoto’s one of those artists, which makes all of her lessons interesting.
                    But I’m different from that&mdash;in art that I like, in the pieces I create. It’s always a memory or
                    feeling that I start with. Ali knows this by now.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre12">“You’re using way too many art metaphors today.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How else will I actually get through to you?” Ali nudges me by the shoulder and we
                    walk outside together, heading to her car. She’d told me she would drop me o at a nearby Starbucks.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">A jock runs by, jostling me as he tries catching up with his teammates o to
                    practice. The buses full of students depart one by one, leaving little trails of smog. Everything’s
                    moving, but, somehow, inside me is still.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why don’t you just feel things out?” she asks me nally as she unlocks her Nissan,
                    and we slide into our seats. “There’s so much in your life that you can’t control, Linh, as much as
                    I <i class="calibre5">totally</i> want things to be different for you. So maybe you can use this
                    chance to do something for yourself. Forget everyone&mdash;your family, Bảo&mdash;this is about you.
                    No rules but your own.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I buckle my seat belt. A reminder pops up on my phone: ten minutes until my co ee
                    with Quyền. Without words I show it to Ali, who brushes the notice away, saying there’s no reason to
                    worry.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I thought you didn’t like Bảo,” I finally say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I said that I didn’t <i class="calibre5">know</i> if I liked him or disliked him.
                    But he has an eye for words. I think he’s better than he realizes.” She makes a right but too
                    widely, and she needs to adjust before straightening in the lane. “You know, I feel like I can write
                    a whole human-interest piece about you, Bảo, and your families.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I strongly disapprove.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Can you imagine the headline?” To my horror, she releases her hands from the
                    steering wheel, doing what I’ll now call the Banner Move. “Two students from rival families and
                    restaurants? Like <i class="calibre5">Romeo and Juliet</i>&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A car honks at us and her hands snap back onto the wheel.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Just drive.”</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">As I walk into the restaurant after an exhausting half hour with Quyền Thành, I try
                    to gather enough enthusiasm to convince my parents they didn’t waste a favor on me. Even though they
                    did.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-71" class="calibre12">Quyền Thành had shown up before me. She sat straight-backed,
                    on a stool no less, her badge from the rm proudly pinned to her chest. She was on her laptop looking
                    focused as she sent o e-mail after e-mail. She wore a gray business suit&mdash;which I won’t mention
                    to my mom because then she’ll despair, “I knew it! You should have worn one to make an impression.”
                    While Quyền was petite and smaller than me, the strength of her handshake took me by surprise. Her
                    eyes, framed by black thick-rimmed glasses, were strikingly clear and I felt that she was somehow
                    scanning my body for answers.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I had questions that I looked up the night before, pulled o some college website
                    about informational interviews. She had clear, precise, straightforward answers; I had to wonder if
                    she was used to doing this type of favor.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She was a mechanical engineer but she was “told that I liked art,” and knew tons of
                    friends who were “into that thing, but it’s not really My Thing.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Our meeting was interspersed with inconvenient pauses, long sips of cold co ee, and
                    me finding it hard to maintain eye contact because I was afraid she’d see the truth about how little
                    interest I really had in engineering.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">By the end of it, though, she smiled sympathetically. She even hugged me as I
                    thanked her for her time.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I know I bored you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, I&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re sort of easy to read.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I hate my face. But Quyền Thành just laughed. “Trust me: You’re not the only one
                    who’s had to su er through hearing about my work. As much as I love what I do, I know it’s not for
                    some people.” She was being so nice that I wish I could have pretended to feel something. But as Ali
                    mentioned, that’s not the way I work&mdash;I either have to feel something…</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Or I don’t.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Some advice. I don’t think I’d enjoy this career as much as I do if it wasn’t <i
                        class="calibre5">mine.</i> And what I mean by that is it’s something I can claim as my own. If
                    my parents were forcing me to be a physicist, I would not be okay. So, do you have something that’s
                    <i class="calibre5">yours</i>?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre12">I don’t nod or answer, still hesitant to prove how I’ve wasted
                    her time. But maybe she saw something in me because she merely nodded, saying, “Good. Then protect
                    it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We parted and she promised not to say anything to her parents.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Back in the restaurant, my parents don’t jump on me right away about the co ee
                    interview. Instead, Mẹ is wrangling a box free from tape. Ba is sitting in a corner booth that my
                    mom banished him to. While his back is better, he’s still wearing his back brace and looks
                    completely miserable, like a dog in his ea cone. I set down my backpack and slip into Mẹ’s booth,
                    inching closer for a look at what’s inside the box. It’s a flower vase, cerulean with specks the color
                    of the jade bracelets she and just about every woman in my family wear. When I was younger, I
                    thought it was something every Việt woman had to wear, some rite of passage.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Whoa.” It’s handmade, that’s for sure. “That’s so cool. Where’s it from?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Dì Vàng.” Mẹ sighs. My aunt always seems to evoke that kind of sigh from my mom.
                    She hands over the vase; I weigh it, feel the slight bumps alternating with smooth curves. I took a
                    pottery class once in freshman year but couldn’t control the speed of my spin, or get the clay into
                    the shape that I wanted. But Dì Vàng does this for a living, which is mind-boggling to think about,
                    something I can only dream of.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She likes sending my mom things, and I know Mẹ likes them, as much as she doesn’t
                    approve of her sister’s career choice, since she displays them everywhere: the mantel under the TV,
                    the nightstand in my parents’ bedroom. I have an elephant-shaped piggy bank that Dì Vàng made for my
                    fth birthday and hand-delivered when she was last in America.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Since the Vietnam War, and especially after the fall of Saigon, which was what
                    forced our family to scatter, most of my extended family relocated to Washington, Louisiana,
                    Florida, and Texas. It wasn’t exactly cheap to y over here, and the government has strict rules, so
                    my aunt must have made the right friends to be able to visit for a little while. I imagined how cool
                    it’d be for her to live permanently nearby and how she could teach me more about her art.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’d asked my mom why Dì Vàng didn’t want to just move here.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre12">Mẹ just waved her hand. Her usual gesture and non-answer.
                    “I’ve tried to convince her, but she says she’s happy there.” Then my mom turned her attention to
                    something seemingly more important, ignoring my question.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">She and Ba tell childhood stories about Vietnam all the time, but they often con
                    ict with each other: the good times, when Mẹ talks about running carefree along the beach with her
                    friends, the sun rising behind them, or when Ba would play soccer with American soldiers stationed
                    nearby. Then there are the dark days&mdash;funerals, saying goodbye to family members, losing
                    everything on their way here. It’s something I can’t ever understand.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Aren’t you supposed to be working?” Ba says grumpily from his booth. Mẹ and I roll
                    our eyes, then pack up the vase again ever so carefully. “Ah, your co ee meeting!” she suddenly
                    remembers. “How was it? Isn’t Quyền Thành so nice?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“She was really nice. Really helpful.” I pick at the ap of the box the vase came
                    in. I wonder if she can pick up on the dullness in my voice.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ nods approvingly. “Perfect. It’s all working out.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Just like Phở Day. Just like anything that doesn’t make them worry too much.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">As I’m tying up my hair, readying myself for my shift, Ali’s words from earlier
                    came back to me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">There’s so much in your life that you can’t control.… So maybe
                        you can use this chance to do something for yourself.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Something just for me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I take out my phone and text Ali.</p>
