                <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">One of my earliest memories of learning Vietnamese at home and at the temple with
                    other kids has to do with a traditional folk poem. If I close my eyes, I’m back in that basement
                    room, surrounded by our teacher’s singsong voice, loud over the overhead ceiling fans ghting o a
                    July heat: <i class="calibre5">Công cha như núi Thái Sơn / Nghĩa mẹ như nước trong nguổn chảy
                        ra…</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">I was more enthralled by the image that went with the folk poem: a towering,
                    majestic mountain wrapped inside a delicate fog. Father. A pool of glistening water gushing from the
                    same mountain. Mother. The next lines talked of honoring their labor and love; the lesson was clear
                    enough: Everything I do is in their re ection.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now alone in my bedroom, I lie at on my back, staring at the ceiling fan turning at
                    the slowest speed possible no matter how far right I turn the knob. I thought the room would feel
                    more spacious since I wasn’t sharing with Evie anymore, as I’ve done for sixteen years. That I can
                    decorate however I want, make it however messy I want. But my body became used to another person in
                    the room, and any desire to rearrange things is forgotten.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Anyone walking in would see two distinct personalities&mdash;one wall immaculately
                    decorated with cute thrift-shop nds&mdash;Evie can sni out discounts like no one else’s business. My
                    side, while it might be just as clean, holds years of my artwork, no rhyme or reason to the colors,
                    from drawings showing my childhood obsession with goats and llamas, to my more recent work.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">On my Picasso desk calendar, I marked the thirtieth but somehow didn’t mark Phở
                    Day. I trace it with my nger&mdash;it’s not the end of the world if I don’t go. I know that. But am
                    I giving something up? Missing out?</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-36" class="calibre12">I sit up quickly and my vision spins. Sometimes when I think
                    too much, I make myself sadder, which doesn’t help at all. I nd refuge in art, escaping thoughts
                    like this, to regain control when life throws another obstacle my way. When I work, magic happens;
                    for a few hours at a time, the world just slips away. I don’t have to listen to customers comparing
                    me to Evie. Any worries about upcoming tests or working a shift at the restaurant&mdash;that all
                    takes second place in my mind. My attention xates on an image or an idea that doesn’t exist just
                    yet, and can’t exist without me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I rst saw art in action when my family and I took a trip to Huntington Beach. We
                    were walking along the boardwalk; I was still young, because I remember holding my mom’s hand when
                    <i class="calibre5">it</i> happened. A small crowd had formed, a sketch artist ensconced inside, his
                    canvas before him. His muse, a little boy, sat in a chair, feet dangling. The boy tried and failed
                    to look serious as the artist captured his likeness on the canvas. He kept grinning at his parents.
                    It was only ve bucks for a portrait, yet the artist treated him like the most important being in the
                    world.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I stayed there the entire time, counting the artist’s deliberate strokes. My mom
                    waited alongside me, half interested and half ready to move. We would have if only we hadn’t reached
                    the end of the boardwalk.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The artist’s still there these days, though his hands look more shriveled and
                    sun-spotted than they did over a decade ago.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I breathe out, letting go of my memories, replacing my thoughts with a nicer
                    reality: <i class="calibre5">Maybe no one will show up and I won’t need to work that night. Maybe my
                        parents will be in such a good mood that they’ll let me go.</i> Their moods are always good
                    indicators of whether or not I can do anything. <i class="calibre5">This is your year</i>,
                    Yamamoto’s voice says in my head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m choosing to believe that can be true.</p>
                <p class="calibre1">Our home has only one oor, with a long hallway connected to each room. I pad lightly
                    across the tiled oor to the opposite end, where Mẹ and Ba’s room sits.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre12">At the door, I hear only whispers. I’m seven again,
                    eavesdropping on my parents like I used to with Evie. Evie would be right across from me, mouthing,
                    <i class="calibre5">What are they saying?</i> because she was never the stealthy type, didn’t have
                    good hearing, and completely sucked at reading lips. Through the slit of the door, I see my father
                    lying prone, shirt o . In the morning, he’s usually half naked, baring his stomach, and wakes up
                    before everyone else, then shu es through each room, lifting up all the window blinds.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ stands next to the bed, a tube of Bengay in plastic-gloved hands. She scolds him
                    in Vietnamese. I lean back against the wall, out of view.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You should have let someone else carry it. You’re not young anymore, Anh.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hmm? One of our cooks? They can barely lift anything. I’m the only one who lifts
                    things back there.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“The only one,” Mẹ repeats sarcastically. “Are you sure?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba, ever the stubborn one, answers, “Yes.” He hisses as she slathers Bengay on his
                    back. She then tells him calmly that if he keeps complaining, she’ll actually break his back. I hide
                    a smile even if I don’t have to. Ba stems his protests and Mẹ takes o her gloves. I hear her go into
                    the bathroom, the creak of the mirror as she puts back the Bengay.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Will we need to hire someone for the day?” Her voice echoes. “I can ask Duy-Loan’s
                    cousin to work.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He doesn’t answer right away, as if he’s waiting for her words to subside. “We have
                    Linh.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He says my name like I’m the solution. A ash of anger courses through me. Why do I
                    always have to be the solution?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You know we can’t a ord more people,” Ba continues. “I think it will be</p>
                <p class="calibre15">ne. I can still help.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Wait. What does he mean?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“If you say so.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">They haven’t told me about any nancial problems. My stomach drops as I remember how
                    anxious my mom looked yesterday, the hope in her voice that the special will work. Of course. But
                    then I remember they wouldn’t have told me something like this. They don’t want me to worry about
                    things that <i class="calibre5">they’re</i> supposed to be worried about. Typical.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-38" class="calibre12">Later, sitting down for dinner at the kitchen table, I smell
                    the Bengay, but Ba doesn’t complain, only winces as he slowly sits down at the head of the table. I
                    slide over our bowls, which Mẹ just lled with rice&mdash;mine full to the brim, while hers is half.
                    She eats the side dishes more than the rice.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Mời Ba ăn cơm. Mời Mẹ ăn cơm</i>,” I say before we start
                    eating.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">We don’t immediately talk, each of us lost in our thoughts. Our chopsticks ding the
                    sides of our bowls. The waves of steam from the <i class="calibre5">canh chua</i> rise up, swirled
                    away by the ceiling fan. It’s one of my favorite dishes&mdash;sour soup, but not the kind sold in
                    Asian restaurants. It’s made sweet from pineapple chunks, and balanced out with simmering tomatoes
                    and tamarind. Mẹ asks if I want more cat sh. I shake my head.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I swallow a clump of rice and muster as much eagerness into my voice as I can. “Phở
                    Day will be fun.”</p>
                <p class="calibre1">By Saturday, Ba’s back problems are worse, and now he can barely move. Mẹ and I
                    leave around noon to start prepping for the rush, but before we do, Mẹ reminds Ba not to do anything
                    too strenuous. Ba lies across the living room couch, TV remote in hand, which is his preferred state
                    whenever he has time o , but he wants to work tonight. As much pain as he’s in, he’s still thinking
                    about the restaurant.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mom’s having none of it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He continues his protest in Vietnamese. “No, you need me tonight. Who’s working the
                    stand?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Lisa.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba snorts. “Lisa! She doesn’t know how to do anything!” Lisa’s been working for us
                    for three weeks, a replacement for the outgoing seniors.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ answers, “Ba say that about her all the time. And Jonathan&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Everyone, basically,” I mumble. “And you’re the one who hired them.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ba just glares. He lies back down, staring at the ceiling.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But what if something goes wrong?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre12">My entire morning was spent alone in my room, preparing myself
                    for tonight’s rush. I was so tense that I couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t even sketch in my note pad
                    or pick up a brush. Ba complaining throughout the house didn’t help things.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Yet now, I hear the genuine worry in his voice, the worry that everything he had
                    masterminded would undo itself.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ pats his head as she passes by, keys in hand. <i class="calibre5">“Đừng lo.”</i>
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">The simple truth is that he can’t get up; all three of us know this. He falls
                    silent. Or more accurately, Mẹ silences him by shutting out any response with the front door.</p>
                <p class="calibre1">One thing that people forget when they’re yelling at waiters or complaining about
                    meal prices is the realities of how much prep goes into the menu. It’s hours. I learned that the
                    hard way when I was young, hanging out in the kitchen, waiting for Mẹ to be done because she said
                    she was “only doing prep.” <i class="calibre5">Only doing</i>. No. That meant watching the outside
                    go from incandescent yellow to midnight blue with specks of white from the street lamps. But it was
                    fun back then. I always had my crayons with me. The waiters and line cooks took their turns watching
                    after me or cooking up something sweet&mdash;caramelized plantains sort of became my drug. Evie took
                    it upon herself to re ll all of the hoisin bottles.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Now in the kitchen, my mom has two large pots cooking on the stovetop, all
                    containing the broth for tonight. Four small pots sit on the prep table, ready to be reheated once
                    the orders come through. Mẹ strides with purpose in the kitchen while the other line cooks chop
                    green onions, limes, and jalapeño peppers, and wash bean sprouts and Thai basil that makes the anise
                    in the phở broth pop even more. It’s all a rhythm; they follow the beat set by Mẹ because they’ve
                    done this for forever. She’s the most methodical in the kitchen, though whatever method she uses
                    here can’t be replicated or measured. It’s instinctive. My art and her cooking are kind of the same,
                    when I think about it. Our hands move before our brains. But I never say this out loud, because the
                    retort would be: “But will it support you?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-40" class="calibre12">“How’s everyone on the outside?” she asks when she notices me
                    watching by the door.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I double-knot my apron strings, then sweep my hair into a high ponytail. “Good.
                    Everything’s in place.” Servers are setting out the soup spoons, chopsticks, and sauces.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Mẹ wipes her forehead with the back of her gloved hands. “Good,” she repeats. I
                    wonder if she’s trying to make herself feel better about tonight. Like I am.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The rst wave of customers are young college students. Lisa greets them, clumsily
                    grabbing the menus. I hope she can pull it together before the real challenge begins.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Within a half hour, our tables are booked and a line has formed, a sight that would
                    make Ba giddy&mdash;as giddy as he can get, at least. Instead, my body pings with a sense of
                    foreboding. As I move to table six with plates of egg rolls, a chatty group of three passes by,
                    Jonathan leading the way. He mouths, <i class="calibre5">Help!</i> before plastering on a fake smile
                    to the group, who seat themselves at table eight&mdash; which I’m sure is reserved.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I make a beeline toward the booth and sort through the table management system. I’m
                    right. Lisa comes back from seating another group, playing with her hands. She does this when she’s
                    nervous. “Lisa, did you check the system just now?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Table eight. Someone had a reservation and we were going to seat them there.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Lisa glances down and blanches. “I’m <i class="calibre5">so</i> sorry, I didn’t see
                    it!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I tamp down my instinct to shout, like Ba would. “Just nd a way to x it.” I turn
                    sharply and control my breathing. It’s not my usual job to greet the guests, only serve them. Lisa
                    will need to do it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Passing by table four, I see a little kid, age six or seven, reach for a bottle of
                    hoisin while his mother chats with a friend. I summon the Mai and Phạm women’s stare&mdash;<i
                        class="calibre5">Mày đang làm gì?</i>&mdash;and the kid retracts his hand. As he should.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-41" class="calibre12">The sound of pots and pans from the kitchen grates on my
                    nerves, threatening to send a headache my way. But there’s nothing I can do to stop it, so I hand in
                    my orders, then circle back to the stand to make sure Lisa hasn’t messed up again&mdash;I can’t help
                    it.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">If possible, the line outside has gotten longer. More college students. Families.
                    Couples. They stare back at me as I pop my head out, a sea of eyes reminding me of a surrealist
                    painting.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Uh, excuse me, miss,” a guy wearing cargo shorts asks. He’s third in line. “How
                    long will it be until we’re seated?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“About a half hour.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Half hour, whoa.” He sends a look to his friend who stands behind him.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I tamp down my annoyance as best I can. “As you can see, it’s quite busy now.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“This is ridiculous,” he mutters to his friend.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We apologize for the wait, but there’s nothing more we can do.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What’s taking so long?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The. Nerve.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hey! We’re having a special! So of course there will be a line!” I snap. The guy
                    reels back for a second, rendered speechless. He’s too shocked to be angry. Before a morti ed
                    apology can slip past my lips, Lisa sidles up to my side, taking control of things. She shoots me a
                    concerned look and says a few things that I can’t make out. The fact that Lisa needs to save me
                    pisses me o even more.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I stalk back to the kitchen. Pine for the art exhibition. I pretend I’m there right
                    now&mdash;me with other patrons. Whenever I’m at a museum, seeing the work of geniuses before me, I
                    imagine a cloud of quiet reverence settling over me. In the room, there’s a bunch of people looking
                    to art for answers, who examine pieces just to <i class="calibre5">feel</i> something.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">One day, I want to be that artist who sees this, who knows that what she created
                    made them feel completely content, lling a void they didn’t know they were seeking.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I want to be there…</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-42" class="calibre12">… but I’m here. The ticket machine pushing out food orders at
                    crank speed yanks me back into my reality. Its chirping will stay in my nightmares forever. From the
                    dining room, Vietnamese, English, Spanish, and other languages and laughter swell up, crashing into
                    me like a tsunami wave. The back room now feels like a sauna.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Con?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom pops her head out when she realizes no one’s picked up the three bowls of
                    phở she just placed at the window.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I just need some air,” I say.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“But&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Just one minute!” I say. Using my whole body, I push through the back door, my
                    mom’s question chasing after me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I duck into the alley. I don’t care that it smells like sh and sewage or that the
                    ground might be dirty; it’s the best sanctuary I can nd in the moment. I slide down, bring my legs
                    to my chest, and rest my forehead on my knees. <i class="calibre5">Breathe, Linh. Breathe.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m not sure how long I sit there. At least I’m alone. At least no one’s here to
                    see me fall apart like Jenga pieces.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Um, hey.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I peer down at the scu ed edges of red Converse.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh no.</i></p>
