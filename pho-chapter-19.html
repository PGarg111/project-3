                <h3>Chapter 19</h3>
                <h2>Bao</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">Slowly, I’m getting used to being on the newspaper, being a part of a team. After
                    the success of my rst review, Ali’s not so on top of me anymore. In her eyes, I’ve stepped up; she’s
                    still delegating proofreading tasks to me, but she’s giving me multiple articles&mdash;more than
                    anyone else on the editing team.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My classmates are coming by to talk about their edits, having revised what they
                    wrote and asking me to look them over. One side of me wonders if they ask me because Ali can be a
                    little intense&mdash;“passionate” was Linh’s word&mdash;but I like to think that they truly want my
                    help. Even if my classmates are using me to avoid Ali, it feels good to be approached like this. To
                    have them trust me with their work.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Each writer looks at language so differently. Ali focuses on the message in
                    writing&mdash;is the point getting across? Where can the writer be clearer in their intention? Me, I
                    like the writer’s style. One person can say something that’s been said before but in a way that’s
                    completely different; their unique experiences and personality infuse their words, their sentences.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m working with Ernie’s article summarizing the National Honor Society’s induction
                    of new members. Ernie shrinks under attention in person, so whether he knows it or not, he uses a
                    lot of passive voice in his writing. Things are done to the subject; the subject isn’t taking
                    action. The budget cut to the arts was cut <i class="calibre5">by</i> the budget committee&mdash;not
                    the budget committee cut the budget for the arts program. Compared to Ali’s writing, which gets
                    straight to the point, Ernie lacks confidence.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I couldn’t get into astronomy; that’s the only reason why I’m here,” he says
                    glumly, reading my edits.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre12">“I didn’t want to take this class either,” I say, trying to
                    cheer him up.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, but you’re good at it. And Ali doesn’t go after you.” As if she were right
                    behind us, Ernie glances over his shoulder.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ali’s sandwiched between two designers huddling around her. They’re going over
                    proofs for the next issue. I might not understand their process, though I don’t have to. It’s hers,
                    it’s theirs, something only they can understand.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ernie’s eyebrows scrunch together like he’s reading a di erent language. I know
                    where he’s coming from.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Journalism might not be for everyone, but you’re not bad at all. Maybe you just
                    need to nd something you like writing about,” I finally say, channeling Linh. “What are you interested
                    in?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I dunno. I like skateboarding. Reading comics.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Anything else?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I guess I watch a lot of Netflix. TV stuff.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I remember Ali trying to recruit Việt as a writer. This might be perfect. “Would
                    you want to write about a show? You can ask Ali if you can do it. She’s looking for a reviewer.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Really?” he asks hesitantly. “Do you think she’ll let me?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Looks like I’m not the only person who’s intimidated by her. I laugh. “I’ll talk to
                    her.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Later, as the dismissal bell rings and students y out of the classroom, I stop by
                    Ali as she’s scrolling through her phone, answering texts. “Oh, hey, Bảo. Did you work through
                    Ernie’s article? Thought it needed to be tightened but otherwise it’s good to print.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, everything worked out. I heard Ernie’s into TV shows. Watches a lot of Net
                    ix. Maybe he should try the entertainment section.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Really? He never told me that.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“He didn’t know we had an open spot.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Ali nods, calculating something in her head. “Sure. Why not?” The alarm clock on
                    her phone goes o . “Shit, I’m gonna be late.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Where are you going?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Part-time gig at a local newspaper.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You work at a school newspaper <i class="calibre5">and</i> a real newspaper too?”
                </p>
                <p id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre12">“Of course, what else would I do with my time?” she says
                    simply. I pretend not to look so shocked but, rst she doesn’t use study hall in favor of heading the
                    newspaper here. And now I learned that she also works part-time. She must really love the newspaper.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">Imagine my surprise when one of Việt’s friends sits down in front of me at lunch.
                    It’s miserable and raining outside so most people are in the cafeteria. Việt hasn’t even sat yet,
                    but Steve, the banana-eating captain, takes a seat across from me. He’s grown out his brown hair,
                    tied it into a little ponytail&mdash;to be ironic? In all our time together, we haven’t really held
                    a conversation.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hey, you busy?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Uh, no.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I wanted to see if you can do something for me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re asking <i class="calibre5">me</i>?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, Việt said you’re on the newspaper or something. Said you edit shit.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Uh, yeah, I edit shit.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He digs into his backpack that almost looks Army-issued. Removes his brown-bag
                    lunch. Used tissues. A paperback and dog-eared Carnegie’s <i class="calibre5">How to Win Friends and
                        Influence People.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">My eyebrows go up.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Steve clears his throat. “My mom wanted me to read it,” he mumbles.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Fascinating. “Right. Uh, you needed my help on what, exactly?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Finally, he yanks out a crumpled, lined piece of paper with his chicken scratch all
                    over it. He smooths it out against the table’s edge, like you would with dollar bills at a vending
                    machine. “I’m working on my personal statement for some college applications, and I have an essay,
                    but I can’t really make the rst paragraph stick. My sisters read it and liked the essay in general,
                    but they say the introduction makes me sound like a fth grader.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ouch.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I know.” He grimaces. “But I think they’re right. I know we always have to open
                    something with a strong statement, but I can’t come up with anything. Can you help?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre12">If Ali were in my seat, she’d have a few more words to say to
                    Steve, probably things worse than his own sisters. But me, I try to be more sympathetic.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I feel for my red pen in my backpack and blow out some air. “Okay, what are you
                    trying to say here, exactly?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">His essay is about his love of running. How it’s not just a physical thing, but a
                    mental thing for him. When he’s stressed out or upset about something, he puts on his shoes and just
                    runs, no destination in mind. As I switch between listening to him talk and reading his words, I’m
                    starting to understand what his sisters said about the introduction. It doesn’t even sound like him.
                    It sounds mechanical, forced.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Start with a feeling,” I tell Steve finally, circling his paragraph. “I like what
                    you said about letting your mind take you on a trip and how you like being surprised by where the
                    run’s taking you.” Kind of like how Linh talks about painting. “So why not open with that?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, but shouldn’t I write some sort of thesis statement, too?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“In a way, yeah. But to call it a thesis statement makes it sound like a school
                    paper. You’re writing a personal statement, a personal essay, about something personal to you:
                    running.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Steve nods, looking down at his pages.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I add, “So be honest and open with that. Make the readers feel what you feel when
                    you run.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Steve doesn’t say anything immediately. I re-cap my pen just so that I can have
                    something to do. Maybe I’m not even helping. Maybe I’ve made him more confused.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt finally arrives, saying something about waiting for more Sloppy Joes. By then,
                    Steve’s nodding to himself, reading my edits. When he looks up, he’s a bit more reenergized.
                    “Thanks, man.” He st-bumps me before sneaking away to the library to type up his new introduction.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">“So, did you help him?” Việt asks through a mouthful of ground beef.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I think so. Why’d you tell him I was good at editing?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">He shrugs. “Because you are.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How would you know?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-129" class="calibre12">“Ali.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’ve been talking to Ali?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, she’s cool. She keeps trying to recruit me for the entertainment section,
                    and I keep telling her no.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt: My best friend with nerves of steel.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Well, I think we might have someone for that section now and I just told her.
                    Maybe she’ll leave you alone.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“It’s all good. She doesn’t really bother me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A sense of unease settles inside me. They’re talking to each other, which means
                    they must <i class="calibre5">like</i> being around each other, which means… “What else do you talk
                    about?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">The saying “Waiting for the other shoe to drop” has never felt more pertinent as I
                    lean forward, expecting Việt’s admission of feelings for Linh’s best friend.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“We talk about when you and Linh are getting together.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">That shoe, from who knows where, never falls.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">“What?”</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt grins. “Yup. Ali’s saying after the fourth review. I’m saying way before
                    that.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Why</i> are you even making bets?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Something to pass the time.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Who do you think is gonna win?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I am, which is why I’m telling you now that this all needs to happen after the
                    second restaurant review. So hurry up.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt’s more invested than I thought he’d be and&mdash;Ali.</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Oh God. Has she said anything to Linh?</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Before I can even ask these important questions, a plethora of bright colors blocks
                    my eld of vision. I look up to see pin-straight bangs against a prominent forehead.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Kelly Tran, president of VSA, the club I’ve ditched way too many times.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Bảo. It’s been a while.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Uh-huh.” This cold reception is expected, given how I skipped duty on a Saturday
                    because <i class="calibre5">it was a Saturday.</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">Việt quickly excuses himself from the table.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre12">He also skipped along with me.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You know, I’ve been meaning to nd you. I’m feeling like you’re not taking your
                    membership seriously. If you continue to miss more meetings, I’m afraid you can’t be in the club
                    anymore.” There’s a threat to her voice, but it’s entirely ineffective since I wasn’t even aware I
                    was still a member.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Movement behind Kelly’s head brings my focus to Linh, and my heart leaps. An
                    excuse! An escape.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, hey, Linh. Great, you finally came. I know we have to go to that thing.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Thing?” Linh asks, an eyebrow quirked. Then with a familiar smile, she says, “Hey,
                    Kelly.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I say, “That thing, yeah.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh.” A pause. A side glance at Kelly. “<i class="calibre5">Oh</i>. Yeah, totally.
                    Let’s go.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Kelly’s looking between us, probably wondering how we even know each other. “Wait,
                    since you’re both here: How about you join our table at the Thuận Phát next weekend? We’re raising
                    money for the club.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Damn it</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Um,” Linh says, hesitating only a little. “Sure, I think I can do it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Awesome!” Kelly does a French exit, relieving me of her colors. “Thanks, Linh.
                    Thanks, Bảo!”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I guess I’ll be there, too,” I say grudgingly.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sorry, I didn’t think <i class="calibre5">you’d</i> be roped in,” Linh says
                    sympathetically.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah. Well, you’re too nice. You could have said no to Kelly.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I like her. We had some classes together and she was always nice. And this club is
                    her baby, so of course I want to help.” She bumps shoulders with me. We’d started walking together
                    without thinking. “C’mon, I’ll be there. It’ll be fun.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“You’re forgetting one thing. This is public. Way public. My mom, her
                    friends&mdash;hell, everyone who owns a business near us&mdash;shop there. Weren’t we trying to
                    avoid being seen together?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Now you’re just trying to get out of volunteering.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Yes and no.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Well, mostly yes.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Wear a disguise,” she says somewhat cheekily. “We’ll gure something out.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre4"><img src="images/000007.jpg" alt="" class="calibre14" /></p>
                <p class="calibre1">Baseball cap and sunglasses. That’ll be my disguise for today.</p>
                <p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Who are you? Are you trying to be a gangster?” Mẹ asks immediately when I come
                    down from my room in the morning.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, I’m protecting myself from the sun.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Well, you don’t look like yourself.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12"><i class="calibre5">Perfect</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom had been happy to hear me mention an e ort to volunteer. Maybe it’s
                    something to share with her gossip circle. <i class="calibre5">Bảo is such a good person. He thinks
                        of other people</i>. Ha.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">While clearing the dishes at breakfast, she o ers to drive me. Well, have Ba drive
                    me as she rides along. That would meet two of her goals for the weekend: (1) force her son to do
                    something and (2) get some grocery shopping done. Mẹ doesn’t go to Thuận Phát too often, maybe every
                    month or so. I guess she hasn’t been there in a few weeks.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I immediately object, imagining her seeing Linh at the table outside Thuận Phát.
                    She’d <i class="calibre5">flip</i> the table, most likely.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’ll take the bus. Don’t want to bother you&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“No, it’s ne&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Really. Anyway, there isn’t anything on sale today. I checked.” I grasp for an
                    excuse. “But Saigon City Marketplace has sales.” I mention the one that’s a bit closer, and I must
                    have said the magic words, which land on Ba as he sets down <i class="calibre5">Người Việt</i> at
                    the table. What’s the point of going when nothing is on sale?</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“<i class="calibre5">Thôi, để nó đi đi</i>,” he says. <i class="calibre5">“Mình sẽ
                        đi</i> Saigon City.<i class="calibre5">”</i></p>
                <p class="calibre12">My mom relents. “Mẹ <i class="calibre5">did</i> want to go to Saigon City to see
                    what herbs are on sale… Maybe I will go today.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Great.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Don’t come back too late. Or eat anything for lunch. I’m making something.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Got it.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I get on bus sixty-six and it drops me o at McFadden. I walk a few minutes to the
                    supermarket. The parking lot is already packed like sardines, Camrys and Highlanders cruising to nd
                    the rst open spot. Mothers marching like they’re on a mission, their kids dragging their feet. Older
                    shoppers walk with the help of their adult daughter or son and others rely on their canes and
                    walkers.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre12">I see the sign rst: <span class="calibre13">HELP VSA</span>,
                    made with enough glitter to stop tra c. Kelly’s doing, most likely. Linh sits at the table, glancing
                    around. She’s dressed in a simple white tee and jeans, sunglasses on top. I slide into the empty
                    seat next to her.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Ta-da.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Bảo?” She laughs and taps on the bill of my ball cap. “Nice disguise.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Thank you. I think it was your suggestion.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh scrutinizes me. “I guess it’ll work. I almost didn’t recognize you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“That good, huh?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Usually your giveaway is your hair. So yeah.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“How’s it going so far? Kelly putting you to work?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Together we watch Kelly, who has stopped a disheveled-looking man who must have
                    been forced to do a last-minute grocery run by his wife. He attempts to escape, to no avail.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“More like she’s doing it herself. Which I think is why not a lot of people want to
                    do this.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Can I tell you a secret?” I lean in, beckoning her, and she follows with a smile
                    playing on her lips. “I’m glad you’re here. Because I wouldn’t want to be alone with her; she
                    despises me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Her laugh catches the other volunteers’ attention.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Why are you laughing? It’s true.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“First it’s Ali who hates you. Then it’s Kelly. Now what did you do to her?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I skipped volunteering.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Okay… ?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Three times.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Bảo! No wonder she loathes you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sorry, that was all back when I wasn’t as motivated.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What’s motivating you now?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">A couple of shoppers have come by, inquiring about our table, and Linh greets them
                    automatically, putting on a smile like she did this all the time. Her energy is palpable and
                    contagious.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre12">“No one in particular,” I answer her question, more to myself
                    than to her.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Meanwhile, Kelly passes down another pile of flyers to replenish our stack. She sips
                    a boba from Boba Corner 2. “What’s with the ball cap?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Bad haircut.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Time passes slowly, but it’s not so bad with Linh next to me. We pass commentary
                    about Kelly’s determined e orts to solicit money while we hand out flyers about VSA’s upcoming events.
                    I spot faint paint marks on the back of her hand, which weren’t there yesterday. She must have t in
                    some painting time this morning.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Were you painting?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Oh, yeah,” she says, sheepish again. “Trying to, at least. I need to submit
                    something to the Gold Key competition. I’m realizing that the deadline is getting closer and
                    closer.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“What are you going to do?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m working on a few things about memory. Good memories. The kind that last a
                    while and show up unexpectedly.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Like?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“A restaurant scene. Just me and my parents as we were closing up in the rst year.
                    It was a tough year, that rst year. People were hard on them.” Linh looks over at me and I know what
                    she’s thinking. My mom. The General and the others, the snide remarks they made at the restaurant
                    and also freely in public&mdash;</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m sorry.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Linh shakes her head. “Anyway, my sister and I never really saw our parents because
                    they were always working. But that night, we finished and it’d gone well, and I remember seeing my
                    parents standing by the front windows, just chatting, saying goodbye to some customers. A totally
                    normal scene.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I’m there with her, can feel the window’s smooth glass against my hand and its
                    warmth after facing the sun for the whole day. Linh’s tone changes into something like reverence and
                    she lifts her hand, gesturing as if she were smearing paint all over a canvas. “But the sky behind
                    them was swathes of blush red and purple and yellow. It took my breath away. It was really
                    beautiful. So I’m working on a small canvas for that.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre12">“That sounds nice.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah, it was.” She looks over at me. “How about you? Still okay with mediocrity?”
                    she says teasingly, leaning forward. A piece of her hair has caught itself on the neck of her
                    T-shirt and I feel like I want to move it away.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Hey, I’ve advanced a little.” I copy Linh, moving closer even though there’s no
                    reason to. “Someone asked for my help the other day. One of Việt’s friends needed help. So I
                    helped.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Did it go well?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Yeah. It doesn’t happen often&mdash;someone asking me for help. Especially with
                    writing. So I was kind of surprised.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“I’m not.” She looks deep in thought. “There are people out there who don’t have
                    the energy to help people get better. They just accept the other person’s</p>
                <p class="calibre4">aws, and sure, there’s less con ict to deal with, but it’s almost like living out a
                </p>
                <p class="calibre1">lie. <i class="calibre5">Then</i> there are people who aren’t afraid to point out
                    something’s wrong&mdash; even something as little as a typo. In the end, you’re making <i
                        class="calibre5">something</i> better, and that’s more than other people are willing to do.”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I clear my throat, trying to quell my emotions fighting against one another. “That’s
                    about the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me. Isn’t that sad?”</p>
                <p class="calibre12">“Sad and true for all kids with demanding Asian parents.” Warmth spreads through
                    me. Other curious shoppers have come to the table, but, not for the rst time, I see only Linh in
                    front of me. Beaming. I have to blink a few times to remember where I am.</p>
