                <h3>Chapter 36</h3>
                <h2>Linh</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1">It‚Äôs crushing to see my parents look scared. Because when they‚Äôre frightened they‚Äôre
                    no longer the people who raised me to be strong, but strangers who look older than they really are.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre12">The inspector came by. He‚Äôs Vietnamese as well. He gave my parents a brisk
                    handshake, clipboard under his armpit, but before stepping into the dining area, he gave a good
                    sweep of the room, eyes calculating. I wondered if he was judging us, how we lived. I wanted to yell
                    that this was all a cruel joke. It was embarrassing to have him rummaging through the kitchen
                    cabinets, bending over and checking under the tables, feeling along the walls for cracks and
                    damages.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">Despite the Health Department clearing us, I see how the rumor has done damage
                    afterward&mdash;small, but damage nonetheless. Customers who‚Äôd visited us daily dropped o until Ba,
                    turning on his charisma, appealed to them, explained the situation, offered them discounts on future
                    meals. The favors that my parents were so reluctant to ask for are used now to recoup whatever
                    unquantifiable loss the rumor had cost us. Luckily, it seems like the stream of new customers hasn‚Äôt
                    been affected.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">There‚Äôs no way to tell if B·∫£o‚Äôs talk with his mom helped in that matter, but the
                    next time I saw him, he said his mother promised to have a word with Nhi Tr∆∞ng, the real culprit. He
                    doesn‚Äôt say much more, though. Sometimes I catch him spacing out, eyebrows furrowed. I‚Äôm prone to
                    daydreams, but not B·∫£o. So he must be bothered by something.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I would hate it if his relationship with his mother was tainted by this. Even if
                    she did play a part in spreading the rumor&mdash;even if&mdash;I don‚Äôt want to demonize her. Just
                    like I wouldn‚Äôt want B·∫£o to demonize my own parents for their prejudice.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre12">He feels maybe more unreachable, even as we spend most of our
                    free time at Chef L√™‚Äôs restaurant, finishing up the mural. I like painting from this height; I‚Äôm
                    untouchable, unreachable, too‚Ä¶ and everything below is smaller. Issues farther away.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">That same distance seems to overtake my parents. I rarely see them in the morning,
                    and when I work after school, they‚Äôre preoccupied at the restaurant. D√¨ V√†ng‚Äôs visit is only a few
                    days away, too. It‚Äôd be impossible to bring up what I heard from B√°c Xu√¢n. Lately, B·∫£o doesn‚Äôt seem
                    as intent on finding out more about our families‚Äô shared past.</p>
                <p class="calibre12">I feel, somehow, that me and B·∫£o are running out of time. That the both of us are
                    being pushed toward an edge, but we won‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll go over until the very moment it happens.
