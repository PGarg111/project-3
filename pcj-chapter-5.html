                <h2>Chapter 5: I PLAY PINOCHLE WITH A HORSE</h2>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre16"><b
                                    class="calibre12">I</b></span></span></span> <span class="calibre5">HAD WEIRD DREAMS
                        FULL OF BARNYARD</span> animals. Most of them wanted to kill me. The rest wanted food.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I must’ve woken up several times, but what I heard and saw made no sense, so I just
                    passed out again. I remember lying in a soft bed, being spoon-fed something that tasted like
                    buttered popcorn, only it was pudding. The girl with curly blond hair hovered over me, smirking as
                    she scraped drips off my chin with the spoon.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">When she saw my eyes open, she asked, “What will happen at the summer solstice?”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">I managed to croak, “What?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She looked around, as if afraid someone would overhear. “What’s going on? What was
                    stolen? We’ve only got a few weeks!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, “I don’t…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Somebody knocked on the door, and the girl quickly filled my mouth with pudding.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">The next time I woke up, the girl was gone.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">A husky blond dude, like a surfer, stood in the corner of the bedroom keeping watch
                    over me. He had blue eyes&mdash;at least a dozen of them&mdash;on his cheeks, his forehead, the
                    backs of his hands.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre17">When I finally came around for good, there was nothing weird
                    about my surroundings, except that they were nicer than I was used to. I was sitting in a deck chair
                    on a huge porch, gazing across a meadow at green hills in the distance. The breeze smelled like
                    strawberries. There was a blanket over my legs, a pillow behind my neck. All that was great, but my
                    mouth felt like a scorpion had been using it for a nest. My tongue was dry and nasty and every one
                    of my teeth hurt.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">On the table next to me was a tall drink. It looked like iced apple juice, with a
                    green straw and a paper parasol stuck through a maraschino cherry.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My hand was so weak I almost dropped the glass once I got my fingers around it.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Careful,” a familiar voice said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover was leaning against the porch railing, looking like he hadn’t slept in a
                    week. Under one arm, he cradled a shoe box. He was wearing blue jeans, Converse hi-tops, and a
                    bright orange T-shirt that said <span class="calibre5">CAMP HALF-</span><span
                        class="calibre5">BLOOD</span> . Just plain old Grover. Not the goat boy.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre17">So maybe I’d had a nightmare. Maybe my mom was okay. We were
                    still on vacation, and we’d stopped here at this big house for some reason. And…</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You saved my life,” Grover said. “I…well, the least I could do…I went back to the
                    hill. I thought you might want this.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Reverently, he placed the shoe box in my lap.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Inside was a black-and-white bull’s horn, the base jagged from being broken off,
                    the tip splattered with dried blood. It hadn’t been a nightmare.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“The Minotaur,” I said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Um, Percy, it isn’t a good idea&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s what they call him in the Greek myths, isn’t it?” I demanded. “The
                    Minotaur. Half man, half bull.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover shifted uncomfortably. “You’ve been out for two days. How much do you
                    remember?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“My mom. Is she really…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He looked down.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I stared across the meadow. There were groves of trees, a winding stream, acres of
                    strawberries spread out under the blue sky. The valley was surrounded by rolling hills, and the
                    tallest one, directly in front of us, was the one with the huge pine tree on top. Even that looked
                    beautiful in the sunlight.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My mother was gone. The whole world should be black and cold. Nothing should look
                    beautiful.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m sorry,” Grover sniffled. “I’m a failure. I’m&mdash;I’m the worst satyr in the
                    world.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He moaned, stomping on his foot so hard it came off. I mean, the Converse hi-top
                    came off. The inside was filled with Styrofoam, except for a hoof-shaped hole.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh, Styx!” he mumbled.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Thunder rolled across the clear sky.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">As he struggled to get his hoof back in the fake foot, I thought, Well, that
                    settles it.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover was a satyr. I was ready to bet that if I shaved his curly brown hair, I’d
                    find tiny horns on his head. But I was too miserable to care that satyrs existed, or even minotaurs.
                    All that meant was my mom really had been squeezed into nothingness, dissolved into yellow light.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">I was alone. An orphan. I would have to live with…Smelly Gabe? No. That would never
                    happen. I would live on the streets first. I would pretend I was seventeen and join the army. I’d do
                    something.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre17">Grover was still sniffling. The poor kid&mdash;poor goat,
                    satyr, whatever&mdash; looked as if he expected to be hit.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I said, “It wasn’t your fault.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes, it was. I was supposed to <i class="calibre7">protect</i> you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Did my mother ask you to protect me?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No. But that’s my job. I’m a keeper. At least…I was.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“But why…” I suddenly felt dizzy, my vision swimming.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Don’t strain yourself,” Grover said. “Here.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He helped me hold my glass and put the straw to my lips.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I recoiled at the taste, because I was expecting apple juice. It wasn’t that at
                    all. It was chocolate-chip cookies. Liquid cookies. And not just any cookies&mdash;my mom’s homemade
                    blue chocolate-chip cookies, buttery and hot, with the chips still melting. Drinking it, my whole
                    body felt warm and good, full of energy. My grief didn’t go away, but I felt as if my mom had just
                    brushed her hand against my cheek, given me a cookie the way she used to when I was small, and told
                    me everything was going to be okay.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Before I knew it, I’d drained the glass. I stared into it, sure I’d just had a warm
                    drink, but the ice cubes hadn’t even melted.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Was it good?” Grover asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I nodded.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What did it taste like?” He sounded so wistful, I felt guilty.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Sorry,” I said. “I should’ve let you taste.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">His eyes got wide. “No! That’s not what I meant. I just…wondered.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Chocolate-chip cookies,” I said. “My mom’s. Homemade.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He sighed. “And how do you feel?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Like I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“That’s good,” he said. “That’s good. I don’t think you could risk drinking any
                    more of that stuff.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What do you mean?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He took the empty glass from me gingerly, as if it were dynamite, and set it back
                    on the table. “Come on. Chiron and Mr. D are waiting.”</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p class="calibre3">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="calibre1">The porch wrapped all the way around the farmhouse.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My legs felt wobbly, trying to walk that far. Grover offered to carry the Minotaur
                    horn, but I held on to it. I’d paid for that souvenir the hard way. I wasn’t going to let it go.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre17">As we came around the opposite end of the house, I caught my
                    breath.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">We must’ve been on the north shore of Long Island, because on this side of the
                    house, the valley marched all the way up to the water, which glittered about a mile in the distance.
                    Between here and there, I simply couldn’t process everything I was seeing. The landscape was dotted
                    with buildings that looked like ancient Greek architecture&mdash;an open-air pavilion, an
                    amphitheater, a circular arena&mdash;except that they all looked brand new, their white marble
                    columns sparkling in the sun. In a nearby sandpit, a dozen high school&ndash;age kids and satyrs
                    played volleyball. Canoes glided across a small lake. Kids in bright orange T-shirts like Grover’s
                    were chasing each other around a cluster of cabins nestled in the woods. Some shot targets at an
                    archery range. Others rode horses down a wooded trail, and, unless I was hallucinating, some of
                    their horses had wings.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Down at the end of the porch, two men sat across from each other at a card table.
                    The blond-haired girl who’d spoon-fed me popcorn-flavored pudding was leaning on the porch rail next
                    to them.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The man facing me was small, but porky. He had a red nose, big watery eyes, and
                    curly hair so black it was almost purple. He looked like those paintings of baby angels&mdash;what
                    do you call them, hubbubs? No, cherubs. That’s it. He looked like a cherub who’d turned middle-aged
                    in a trailer park. He wore a tiger-pattern Hawaiian shirt, and he would’ve fit right in at one of
                    Gabe’s power parties, except I got the feeling this guy could’ve out-gambled even my stepfather.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre17">“That’s Mr. D,” Grover murmured to me. “He’s the camp
                    director. Be polite. The girl, that’s Annabeth Chase. She’s just a camper, but she’s been here
                    longer than just about anybody. And you already know Chiron…”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre17">He pointed at the guy whose back was to me.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">First, I realized he was sitting in the wheelchair. Then I recognized the tweed
                    jacket, the thinning brown hair, the scraggly beard.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Mr. Brunner!” I cried.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The Latin teacher turned and smiled at me. His eyes had that mischievous glint they
                    sometimes got in class when he pulled a pop quiz and made all the multiple choice answers <i
                        class="calibre7">B</i>.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Ah, good, Percy,” he said. “Now we have four for pinochle.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He offered me a chair to the right of Mr. D, who looked at me with bloodshot eyes
                    and heaved a great sigh. “Oh, I suppose I must say it. Welcome to Camp Half-Blood. There. Now, don’t
                    expect me to be glad to see you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Uh, thanks.” I scooted a little farther away from him because, if there was one
                    thing I had learned from living with Gabe, it was how to tell when an adult has been hitting the
                    happy juice. If Mr. D was a stranger to alcohol, I was a satyr.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Annabeth?” Mr. Brunner called to the blond girl.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She came forward and Mr. Brunner introduced us. “This young lady nursed you back to
                    health, Percy. Annabeth, my dear, why don’t you go check on Percy’s bunk? We’ll be putting him in
                    cabin eleven for now.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Annabeth said, “Sure, Chiron.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She was probably my age, maybe a couple inches taller, and a whole lot more
                    athletic looking. With her deep tan and her curly blond hair, she was almost exactly what I thought
                    a stereotypical California girl would look like, except her eyes ruined the image. They were
                    startling gray, like storm clouds: pretty, but intimidating, too, as if she were analyzing the best
                    way to take me down in a fight.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">She glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me. I imagined she was
                    going to say, <i class="calibre7">You killed a minotaur!</i> or <i class="calibre7">Wow, you’re so
                        awesome!</i> or something like that.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Instead she said, “You drool when you sleep.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Then she sprinted off down the lawn, her blond hair flying behind her.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“So,” I said, anxious to change the subject. “You, uh, work here, Mr. Brunner?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Not Mr. Brunner,” the ex&ndash;Mr. Brunner said. “I’m afraid that was a pseudonym.
                    You may call me Chiron.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre17">“Okay.” Totally confused, I looked at the director. “And Mr.
                    D…does that stand for something?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Mr. D stopped shuffling the cards. He looked at me like I’d just belched loudly.
                    “Young man, names are powerful things. You don’t just go around using them for no reason.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh. Right. Sorry.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I must say, Percy,” Chiron-Brunner broke in, “I’m glad to see you alive. It’s been
                    a long time since I’ve made a house call to a potential camper. I’d hate to think I’ve wasted my
                    time.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“House call?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“My year at Yancy Academy, to instruct you. We have satyrs at most schools, of
                    course, keeping a lookout. But Grover alerted me as soon as he met you. He sensed you were something
                    special, so I decided to come upstate. I convinced the other Latin teacher to…ah, take a leave of
                    absence.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I tried to remember the beginning of the school year. It seemed like so long ago,
                    but I did have a fuzzy memory of there being another Latin teacher my first week at Yancy. Then,
                    without explanation, he had disappeared and Mr. Brunner had taken the class.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You came to Yancy just to teach me?” I asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron nodded. “Honestly, I wasn’t sure about you at first. We contacted your
                    mother, let her know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for Camp Half-Blood. But
                    you still had so much to learn. Nevertheless, you made it here alive, and that’s always the first
                    test.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Grover,” Mr. D said impatiently, “are you playing or not?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes, sir!” Grover trembled as he took the fourth chair, though I didn’t know why
                    he should be so afraid of a pudgy little man in a tiger-print Hawaiian shirt.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You <i class="calibre7">do</i> know how to play pinochle?” Mr. D eyed me
                    suspiciously.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m afraid not,” I said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m afraid not, <i class="calibre7">sir</i>,” he said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Sir,” I repeated. I was liking the camp director less and less.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Well,” he told me, “it is, along with gladiator fighting and Pac-Man, one of the
                    greatest games ever invented by humans. I would expect all <i class="calibre7">civilized</i> young
                    men to know the rules.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m sure the boy can learn,” Chiron said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Please,” I said, “what is this place? What am I doing here? Mr. Brun&mdash;
                    Chiron&mdash;why would you go to Yancy Academy just to teach me?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre17">Mr. D snorted. “I asked the same question.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The camp director dealt the cards. Grover flinched every time one landed in his
                    pile.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron smiled at me sympathetically, the way he used to in Latin class, as if to
                    let me know that no matter what my average was, <i class="calibre7">I</i> was his star student. He
                    expected <i class="calibre7">me</i> to have the right answer.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Percy,” he said. “Did your mother tell you nothing?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“She said…” I remembered her sad eyes, looking out over the sea. “She told me she
                    was afraid to send me here, even though my father had wanted her to. She said that once I was here,
                    I probably couldn’t leave. She wanted to keep me close to her.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Typical,” Mr. D said. “That’s how they usually get killed. Young man, are you
                    bidding or not?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What?” I asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He explained, impatiently, how you bid in pinochle, and so I did.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m afraid there’s too much to tell,” Chiron said. “I’m afraid our usual
                    orientation film won’t be sufficient.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Orientation film?” I asked.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No,” Chiron decided. “Well, Percy. You know your friend Grover is a satyr. You
                    know”&mdash;he pointed to the horn in the shoe box&mdash;“that you have killed the Minotaur. No
                    small feat, either, lad. What you may not know is that great powers are at work in your life.
                    Gods&mdash;the forces you call the Greek gods&mdash;are very much alive.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I stared at the others around the table.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I waited for somebody to yell, <i class="calibre7">Not!</i> But all I got was Mr. D
                    yelling, “Oh, a royal marriage. Trick! Trick!” He cackled as he tallied up his points.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Mr. D,” Grover asked timidly, “if you’re not going to eat it, could I have your
                    Diet Coke can?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Eh? Oh, all right.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover bit a huge shard out of the empty aluminum can and chewed it mournfully.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Wait,” I told Chiron. “You’re telling me there’s such a thing as God.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Well, now,” Chiron said. “God&mdash;capital <i class="calibre7">G</i>, God. That’s
                    a different matter altogether. We shan’t deal with the metaphysical.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Metaphysical? But you were just talking about&mdash;”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Ah, gods, plural, as in, great beings that control the forces of nature and human
                    endeavors: the immortal gods of Olympus. That’s a smaller matter.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-96" class="calibre17">“Smaller?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes, quite. The gods we discussed in Latin class.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Zeus,” I said. “Hera. Apollo. You mean them.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">And there it was again&mdash;distant thunder on a cloudless day.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Young man,” said Mr. D, “I would really be less casual about throwing those names
                    around, if I were you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“But they’re stories,” I said. “They’re&mdash;myths, to explain lightning and the
                    seasons and stuff. They’re what people believed before there was science.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Science!” Mr. D scoffed. “And tell me, Perseus Jackson”&mdash;I flinched when he
                    said my real name, which I never told anybody&mdash;“what will people think of your ‘science’ two
                    thousand years from now?” Mr. D continued. “Hmm? They will call it primitive mumbo jumbo. That’s
                    what. Oh, I love mortals&mdash;they have absolutely no sense of perspective. They think they’ve come
                    <i class="calibre7">so-o-o</i> far. And have they, Chiron? Look at this boy and tell me.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">I wasn’t liking Mr. D much, but there was something about the way he called me
                    mortal, as if…he wasn’t. It was enough to put a lump in my throat, to suggest why Grover was
                    dutifully minding his cards, chewing his soda can, and keeping his mouth shut.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Percy,” Chiron said, “you may choose to believe or not, but the fact is that <i
                        class="calibre7">immortal</i> means immortal. Can you imagine that for a moment, never dying?
                    Never fading? Existing, just as you are, for all time?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I was about to answer, off the top of my head, that it sounded like a pretty good
                    deal, but the tone of Chiron’s voice made me hesitate.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You mean, whether people believed in you or not,” I said.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Exactly,” Chiron agreed. “If you were a god, how would you like being called a
                    myth, an old story to explain lightning? What if I told you, Perseus Jackson, that someday people
                    would call <i class="calibre7">you</i> a myth, just created to explain how little boys can get over
                    losing their mothers?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My heart pounded. He was trying to make me angry for some reason, but I wasn’t
                    going to let him. I said, “I wouldn’t like it. But I don’t believe in gods.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Oh, you’d better,” Mr. D murmured. “Before one of them incinerates you.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover said, “P-please, sir. He’s just lost his mother. He’s in shock.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“A lucky thing, too,” Mr. D grumbled, playing a card. “Bad enough I’m confined to
                    this miserable job, working with boys who don’t even believe!”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre17">He waved his hand and a goblet appeared on the table, as if
                    the sunlight had bent, momentarily, and woven the air into glass. The goblet filled itself with red
                    wine.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">My jaw dropped, but Chiron hardly looked up.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Mr. D,” he warned, “your restrictions.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Mr. D looked at the wine and feigned surprise.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Dear me.” He looked at the sky and yelled, “Old habits! Sorry!”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">More thunder.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Mr. D waved his hand again, and the wineglass changed into a fresh can of Diet
                    Coke. He sighed unhappily, popped the top of the soda, and went back to his card game.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron winked at me. “Mr. D offended his father a while back, took a fancy to a
                    wood nymph who had been declared off-limits.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“A wood nymph,” I repeated, still staring at the Diet Coke can like it was from
                    outer space.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes,” Mr. D confessed. “Father loves to punish me. The first time, Prohibition.
                    Ghastly! Absolutely horrid ten years! The second time&mdash;well, she really was pretty, and I
                    couldn’t stay away&mdash;the second time, he sent me here. Half-Blood Hill. Summer camp for brats
                    like you. ‘Be a better influence,’ he told me. ‘Work with youths rather than tearing them down.’ Ha!
                    Absolutely unfair.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Mr. D sounded about six years old, like a pouting little kid.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And…” I stammered, “your father is…”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“<i class="calibre7">Di immortales,</i> Chiron,” Mr. D said. “I thought you taught
                    this boy the basics. My father is Zeus, of course.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I ran through D names from Greek mythology. Wine. The skin of a tiger. The satyrs
                    that all seemed to work here. The way Grover cringed, as if Mr. D were his master.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’re Dionysus,” I said. “The god of wine.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Mr. D rolled his eyes. “What do they say, these days, Grover? Do the children say,
                    ‘Well, duh!’?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Y-yes, Mr. D.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Then, well, duh! Percy Jackson. Did you think I was Aphrodite, perhaps?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You’re a god.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Yes, child.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“A god. You.”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre17">He turned to look at me straight on, and I saw a kind of
                    purplish fire in his eyes, a hint that this whiny, plump little man was only showing me the tiniest
                    bit of his true nature. I saw visions of grape vines choking unbelievers to death, drunken warriors
                    insane with battle lust, sailors screaming as their hands turned to flippers, their faces elongating
                    into dolphin snouts. I knew that if I pushed him, Mr. D would show me worse things. He would plant a
                    disease in my brain that would leave me wearing a straitjacket in a rubber room for the rest of my
                    life.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Would you like to test me, child?” he said quietly.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“No. No, sir.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">The fire died a little. He turned back to his card game. “I believe I win.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Not quite, Mr. D,” Chiron said. He set down a straight, tallied the points, and
                    said, “The game goes to me.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">I thought Mr. D was going to vaporize Chiron right out of his wheelchair, but he
                    just sighed through his nose, as if he were used to being beaten by the Latin teacher. He got up,
                    and Grover rose, too.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“I’m tired,” Mr. D said. “I believe I’ll take a nap before the sing-along tonight.
                    But first, Grover, we need to talk, <i class="calibre7">again</i>, about your less-than-perfect
                    performance on this assignment.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Grover’s face beaded with sweat. “Y-yes, sir.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Mr. D turned to me. “Cabin eleven, Percy Jackson. And mind your manners.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">He swept into the farmhouse, Grover following miserably.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Will Grover be okay?” I asked Chiron.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron nodded, though he looked a bit troubled. “Old Dionysus isn’t really mad. He
                    just hates his job. He’s been…ah, grounded, I guess you would say, and he can’t stand waiting
                    another century before he’s allowed to go back to Olympus.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Mount Olympus,” I said. “You’re telling me there really is a palace there?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Well now, there’s Mount Olympus in Greece. And then there’s the home of the gods,
                    the convergence point of their powers, which did indeed use to be on Mount Olympus. It’s still
                    called Mount Olympus, out of respect to the old ways, but the palace moves, Percy, just as the gods
                    do.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“You mean the Greek gods are here? Like…in <i class="calibre7">America</i>?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“The what?”</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre17">“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you
                    think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has
                    burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it. You might even say they are the
                    source of it, or at least, they are tied so tightly to it that they couldn’t possible fade, not
                    unless all of Western civilization were obliterated. The fire started in Greece. Then, as you well
                    know&mdash;or as I hope you know, since you passed my course&mdash;the heart of the fire moved to
                    Rome, and so did the gods. Oh, different names, perhaps&mdash; Jupiter for Zeus, Venus for
                    Aphrodite, and so on&mdash;but the same forces, the same gods.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“And then they died.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Died? No. Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to
                    Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several
                    centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.
                    Every place they’ve ruled, for the last three thousand years, you can see them in paintings, in
                    statues, on the most important buildings. And yes, Percy, of course they are now in your United
                    States. Look at your symbol, the eagle of Zeus. Look at the statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller
                    Center, the Greek facades of your government buildings in Washington. I defy you to find any
                    American city where the Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places. Like it or
                    not&mdash;and believe me, plenty of people weren’t very fond of Rome, either&mdash;America is now
                    the heart of the flame. It is the great power of the West. And so Olympus is here. And we are here.”
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">It was all too much, especially the fact that I seemed to be included in Chiron’s
                    <i class="calibre7">we</i>, as if I were part of some club.
                </p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Who are you, Chiron? Who…who am I?”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">Chiron smiled. He shifted his weight as if he were going to get up out of his
                    wheelchair, but I knew that was impossible. He was paralyzed from the waist down.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“Who are you?” he mused. “Well, that’s the question we all want answered, isn’t it?
                    But for now, we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven. There will be new friends to meet. And plenty
                    of time for lessons tomorrow. Besides, there will be s’mores at the campfire tonight, and I simply
                    adore chocolate.”</p>
                <p class="calibre17">And then he did rise from his wheelchair. But there was something odd about the way
                    he did it. His blanket fell away from his legs, but the legs didn’t move. His waist kept getting
                    longer, rising above his belt. At first, I thought he was wearing very long, white velvet underwear,
                    but as he kept rising out of the chair, taller than any man, I realized that the velvet underwear
                    wasn’t underwear; it was the front of an animal, muscle and sinew under coarse white fur. And the
                    wheelchair wasn’t a chair. It was some kind of container, an enormous box on wheels, and it must’ve
                    been magic, because there’s no way it could’ve held all of him. A leg came out, long and
                    knobby-kneed, with a huge polished hoof. Then another front leg, then hindquarters, and then the box
                    was empty, nothing but a metal shell with a couple of fake human legs attached.</p>
                <p id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre17">I stared at the horse who had just sprung from the
                    wheelchair: a huge white stallion. But where its neck should be was the upper body of my Latin
                    teacher, smoothly grafted to the horse’s trunk.</p>
                <p class="calibre17">“What a relief,” the centaur said. “I’d been cooped up in there so long, my
                    fetlocks had fallen asleep. Now, come, Percy Jackson. Let’s meet the other campers.”</p>
